The SMR uses the working principle of the Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR), i.e. emits a signal which is reflected by the target and the echo received is used to determine the range and bearing of the target. The SMR however, operates on much higher frequencies (10-20 GHz) as opposed to the PSR (1-5 GHz). As a result, the antenna is much smaller (and lighter) which allows faster rotation (typically 1 revolution per second as opposed to 6-12 revolutions per minute) and therefore faster update rate. Azimuth resolution is also improved (about 0.25 degrees) compared to the PSR (1-2 degrees) due to the thinner beamwidth (which is achieved due to the higher frequency used). While range is considerably shorter compared to other radars (not to be considered to be a drawback though since the very purpose of the SMR is to cover only the manoeuvring area) this allows for shorter pulse to be used which in turn results in much better range resolution (about 20 m). The SMR is often mounted on top of the ATC tower which provides good visibility of the manoeuvring area. An inherent limitation of SMR is that it only provides position information. However, if combined e.g. with an ADS-B receiver, additional information may be displayed on the controller screen.
