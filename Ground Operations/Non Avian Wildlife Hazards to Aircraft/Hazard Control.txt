The only option for large animals at airports used for scheduled service public transport flights is exclusion. Fortunately this has been aided by the trend towards securing airport perimeters with fencing of a sufficient scale and robustness to deny unauthorised human access. However, such perimeter fencing is not yet universal and is certainly not present at many smaller airports used by business and general aviation and for aerial work and leisure flying.
