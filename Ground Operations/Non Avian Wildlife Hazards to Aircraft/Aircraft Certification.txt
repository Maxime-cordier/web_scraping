Unlike the case of birds and aircraft jet engines or windscreens, there are neither requirements nor manufacturers minimum standards for the parts of aircraft which may impact animals. Landing gear is a particular case. Nose gear impact with, say a fox, at speed may cause significant damage to a smaller aircraft, even up to the size of a 50 seat regional jet. No direct consideration of the effects of impacts of this sort on landing gear assemblies is given by their designers and this includes their important secondary functions as the platform for lower speed directional control (nose gear) and for braking (main gear).
