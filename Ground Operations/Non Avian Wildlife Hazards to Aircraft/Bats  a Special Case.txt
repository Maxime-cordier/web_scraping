As the only flying mammals, the hazard to aircraft from bats is similar in nature to that from birds in respect of the potential for airborne impact. However, bats generally fly only between dusk and dawn - although not necessarily only when it is fully dark. Bats can be conveniently divided into two classes, ‘small’ and ‘large’, for hazard assessment, subject to the caveat applied to birds about the hazards of flocking. Generally smaller ‘insectivorous’ bats (so called because they feed exclusively on insects) are found throughout the world whereas generally larger ‘fruit bats’ or ‘flying foxes’ (which are vegetarians) are found everywhere except the Americas. As with birds, bats’ flight habits do depend upon prevailing weather conditions but the insectivorous bats in particular are highly focussed on feeding opportunities and will readily fly even in light rain if insects are on the wing in numbers. Conditions like this often occur during thunderstorms over land in warm weather when a bird hazard would be unlikely. Insectivorous bat activity usually peaks in the two hours from near darkness and again around dawn. Dawn flight activity is more likely to extend into full daylight. Fruit bats are more likely to begin flight whilst it is only beginning to get dark and continue doing so during the night.
