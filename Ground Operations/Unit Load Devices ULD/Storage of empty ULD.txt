Empty containers should always be stored in suitable container racking, set up for easy transfer to dollies or other handling equipment without the use of a forklift. Outdoors racking should be equipped to prevent containers blowing away in windy conditions. Empty containers should only be stacked where there exists proper training and controls and where the containers are designed to be lifted by forklift. With the exception of a ULD which is approved for forklift handling, they should never be left on the ground even if empty. Empty pallets may be stored in stacks, taking care that: Nets may be permanently attached to a pallet (along one side by locking the fittings in place) or may be completely removable. If removable they should be stored in a dry location.
