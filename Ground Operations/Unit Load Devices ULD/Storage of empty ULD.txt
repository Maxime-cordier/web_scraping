Empty containers should always be stored in suitable container racking, set up for easy transfer to dollies or other handling equipment without the use of a forklift. Outdoors racking should be equipped to prevent containers blowing away in windy conditions. Empty containers should only be stacked where there exists proper training and controls and where the containers are designed to be lifted by forklift. With the exception of a ULD which is approved for forklift handling, they should never be left on the ground even if empty. Empty pallets may be stored in stacks, taking care that: Cargo nets, if attached, are not damaged during the stacking/ unstacking process. Stacks of pallets built up for transfer to another location by ground or air are properly built up on a “base pallet” , with suitable spacing material between the bottom of the pallet stack and the “base pallet”, and secured to the base pallet by tie down straps.. When removing pallets approved for fork lift truck handling from a stack, this must be done without the fork tines damaging the pallet edge rails.. Nets may be permanently attached to a pallet (along one side by locking the fittings in place) or may be completely removable. If removable they should be stored in a dry location.
