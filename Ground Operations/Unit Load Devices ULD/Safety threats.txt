The primary purpose of ULD is to improve flight safety compared to bulk loading of holds. Whilst a serviceable ULD, properly loaded, will indeed achieve this, a widespread lack of attention to/ awareness of ULD damage can result in risk arising from the use of containers that are not within their allowable damage limits. The still common attitude that “it doesn’t matter as long as the cargo/ baggage makes the flight” and a widespread lack of adequate training for those involved in ULD operations can seriously impact on aircraft safety. Damaged and/or improperly loaded ULD present a hazard to operators, aircraft systems and structure, cargo and baggage and GSE. Used correctly ULD will remain within their safety limits for many years, requiring only minor repairs to wear and tear type damages. Incorrect handling of ULD, particularly the indiscriminate use of forklifts will result in ULD damage rendering them unserviceable for use. Failure to observe rules and a “make it up as we go along “ approach to ULD operations will result in safety breaches.
