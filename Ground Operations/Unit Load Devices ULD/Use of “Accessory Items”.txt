Cargo straps are generally used to secure large/heavy objects that are not suited for restraint by a cargo net. They are also used to secure heavy items loaded inside a container subject to certain conditions. Cargo straps are typically of 2 types: 2000 lbs breaking strain straps having webbing about 1” (2.5cm) wide and single stud attachment fittings at each end; and. 5000 lbs breaking strain straps having webbing about 2” (5.0cm) wide with hooks and/or double stud fittings at each end.. 2000 lbs straps are generally used in the bulk holds of aircraft (such as 737 holds) while 5000 lbs straps are used to secure loads to pallets/containers. The use of cargo straps to secure any piece of cargo in lieu of a net requires great care and should only be done in accordance with the carriers specified procedures. General guidance can be found in the IATA ULD Technical Manual Standard Specification 60/2 Appendix A which is a simplified version of ISO standard 16049 Part 2, but this cannot replace specific airline instructions. Tie down fittings are generally a double stud with a 2” dia.welded stainless steel ring. These may be used to connect a tie down strap terminated only with a hook into the pallet edge rail. They are not to be used as “temporary repair” for cargo nets, nor as some kind of additional lashing process. Both straps and tie down fittings may only be deemed safe when issued by the owner airline. The use of a strap or fitting picked up from the floor of the terminal is unsafe. At present there is no certification standard for straps as there are for containers, pallets and nets, however a standard is in process and awaiting FAA implementation.
