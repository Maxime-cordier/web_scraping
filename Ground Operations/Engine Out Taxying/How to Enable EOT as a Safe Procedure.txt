The incorporation of an approved, standardised EOT procedure into the applicable Operations Manual, as part of taxying procedures should always occur if the procedure is to be available. These EOT procedures should mirror manufacturer protocols, where published, and must clearly identify and address any areas of potential confusion such as responsibilities and task allocation during start up and shutdown. They should also provide guidance on when EOT may or may not be used. The procedure should specify whether engine starting may be carried out whilst the aircraft is taxying and if it is, then appropriate and explicit guidance on how this can be safely achieved should be provided. In general, the Operations Manual entry must clearly state that any EOT is carried out entirely at the aircraft commanders discretion after careful consideration of all location-specific and operational circumstances. Such operational circumstances include but are not necessarily restricted to: Local airport conditions which may militate against such operations, for example taxiway/ramp surface gradients. Proximity of other aircraft, vehicles and personnel when using EOT during taxy-out as break away thrust requirements must be satisfied with fewer engines. Manoeuvring freedom in respect of turn radius and direction of turn. The possibility of engine damage by Foreign Object Debris (FOD) due to increased jet efflux or prop wash. The ability to satisfy AFM engine warm-up and cool down times for thermal stabilisation. During cold weather operations, consideration of the time it will take to reach the minimum oil temperature requirements for application of take off thrust. The prevailing weather and surface conditions. The need to accomplish procedures related to aircraft system monitoring and checklist completion despite a delayed engine start (during taxy-out) and/or an early engine shut-down (during taxy-in).
