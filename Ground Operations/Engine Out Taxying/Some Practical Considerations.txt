If the aircraft commander elects to carry out an EOT procedure after considering the above points, the following factors should be taken into account: Caution must be exercised when taxying with one (for twin engine) or two engine(s) shut down, to compensate for the possible asymmetric force. This is especially critical when there is surface contamination. Slow and/or minimum radius turns in the direction of the operating engine may not be possible at high gross weight.. Aircraft system operation need to be carefully considered to ensure that the critical systems needed for taxying such as Nose Wheel Steering and brake systems remain operative. This may require the activation of electrically driven hydraulic pumps.. An engine start procedure requires time and attention, which should not be detrimental to other taxying duties, such as external visual scanning, systems monitoring and checklist accomplishment. Consideration should be given to the expected departure route and number-in-sequence relative to the time needed for engine start and “after start” items.. In particular, an engine should not be started: By the pilot controlling the aircraft unless it is stopped and the park brake has been applied;. When taxying on an apron or within a complex taxiway layout;. When crossing an active runway;. When taxying in low visibility conditions..
