The only widely available requirements for indicating the presence of arrestor gear across runways used by civil aircraft are those published by the FAA. Their requirements for indicating the presence of a permanent aircraft arresting system cable crossing a runway used by civil aircraft are: These two requirements are depicted in the diagram below which was taken from the FAA AC 150/5220-9A 'Aircraft arresting systems on civil airports'. Although ICAO Annex 14 does not contain specific requirements for identification of the location of raised 'rigged and up' arrestor cables, at night they would constitute an obstruction and, as such, would require illumination. This is usually provided by an illuminated circle of the type required by the FAA. Note that the U.S. term for arrestor cable installations is 'BAK' - derived from 'barrier arresting systems' but there are many other terms in use.
