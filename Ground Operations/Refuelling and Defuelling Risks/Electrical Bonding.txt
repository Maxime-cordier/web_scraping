There must be a cable to link to designated points or to clean unpainted metal surfaces on the chosen airframe. Bonding cables should connect the installation delivering the fuel with the aircraft or installation receiving the fuel. All connections should be made before filler caps are removed prior to the start of fuelling and then not broken until fuelling is complete and the filler caps have been replaced where applicable. On no account should either the fuelling vehicle (including hydrant dispenser) or the aircraft be bonded to a fuel hydrant pit. It should be noted that Fuel Hoses, including so-called “conductive” hoses, are not suitable substitutes for dedicated clips and bonding wires.
