The EVS incorporates a specialized advance infrared imaging technology. The new generation IR cameras operate in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectrum. This SWIR sensor is specially tuned to the frequency of runway lights, and is sensitive to the light inherent in the surrounding environment. The nose radome-mounted camera sends a picture to the HUD combiner, giving the pilot an accurate look in low visibility conditions. Even at night, EVS renders visible runway markings, taxiways, adjacent highways, and the surrounding landscape, drastically improving the margin for error and for Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT).
