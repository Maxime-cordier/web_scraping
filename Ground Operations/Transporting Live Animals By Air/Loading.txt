It is essential to consult with aircraft manufacturers regarding specific recommendations for loading different aircraft types and models. However, the following factors should be considered. Do not transport animals and carbon dioxide (usually in dry ice form) in the same compartment.. Avoid mixing live animals with cargo that contains a lot of moisture on the container, such as rain, snow, or ice, or liquids inside the container.. Load animal containers with enough space between pallets to allow air to freely circulate.. Spreading animals evenly within and between cargo compartments can help to reduce condensation, however, weight and balance limits will still need to be complied with.. Some areas within cargo compartments may suffer greater heat transfer through the walls, and animal densities should be reduced in such circumstances.. Animal containers, pallets and stalls need to maintain their location and their integrity during turbulence in flight.. Containers are designed specifically for different species of animal, and they should have adequate ventilation gaps and holes to allow air flow, and reduce localised temperature and CO2 build-up.. Container construction also needs to cope with animal behaviour that may weaken its structure, e.g. gnawing, clawing, kicking etc.. Container construction should allow for appropriate inspections, both in-flight and on the ground. Adequate lighting is therefore also required.. When animals are self-loading, the slope of loading ramps should be minimised to facilitate each animal species’ ability, and consideration given to batons or other anti-slip measures.. When transporting animals in belly holds (lower deck compartments), access in flight will not likely be possible. All aspects of the animals’ welfare need to be planned and accounted for, especially as temperature control is usually more difficult in these belly holds..
