Today in an ATC tower, the controller is surrounded by a number of individual systems all having their own interface, without any common information management. In the future, a greater number of systems will provide even more information to the controller. Therefore, there is a need to study the integration of the various airport airside system components into an integrated tower working position (ITWP). The ITWP project is a part of the EUROCONTROL Medium Term Work Program. Information management and integration are key enablers for the future airport development with controller as final decision maker. The ITWP will include integration of information and data coming from TMA/APP sectors, arrival manager (AMAN), departure manager (DMAN), advanced surface movement guidance and control system (A-SMGCS), electronic flight strips (EFS), METEO systems, wake information, stand and gate management, data link applications and ATFM applications, Airport CDM concepts (and others as required). The A-SMGCS and EFS are seen as the foundations of the ITWP. The A-SMGCS applications will serve as a structure for the development of the ITWP project. They encompass the surveillance and alerting functions as deployed today in some European airports but will also extend to further developments foreseen with the A-SMGCS guidance, routing, and planning functions.
