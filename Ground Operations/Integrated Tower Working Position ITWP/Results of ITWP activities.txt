Study of several ATC Towers and Controller Task Analysis completed (ENAV, LFV, DSNA, NATS, DFS and NAV Portugal). First version of ITWP prototype evaluated, included A-SMGCS, EFS, Air Traffic Monitor, MET, Airfield Equipment Monitor.. Three control positions studied –Runway (manages traffic on the runway), Ground (manages traffic on taxiways and apron) and Clearance (ATC clearance delivery). All necessary information is displayed to the controller on the same HMI display. A single 30 inch screen is provided to each Runway and Ground controller.. To improve the integration of information, ITWP provides controllers with an air/ground composite radar image, multiple windows management which aims to display the most important information on the foreground, and improved information linking between applications in terms of communication of information.. ITWP provides a common environment independent of the controller role (display, interaction means), therefore the CWP parameters can be adapted by each controller. Each Role is configured to the tasks required to be performed.. Electronic strips and bays are used to improve coordination between ATC controllers, facilitate the circulation of flight strips between controller positions (compared to standing away from their position and transferring it manually), and to provide the ability to share a unique (virtual) object amongst tower controllers. Controllers can interact with flights through both the electronic strips and radar labels.. As a result of the controller task analysis for each role, next predicted logical events are presented to controllers (e.g. after a line up, a take off clearance would be expected). Safety support tools which detect potential and actual hazardous situations are implemented. The ITWP provides alerts related to the non conformance detection, inconsistent clearances, runway conflicts, alerts linked to the controllers’ input error related to the airport layout and other alerts..
