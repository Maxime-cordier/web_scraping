There is no system integration, and there is very little data interchange between the individual systems. There is very little or no decision support. The human-machine interface (HMI) is dependent on the individual system component, as each has its own interface. Adding new systems and functions (e.g. AMAN, DMAN, A-CDM, etc.) is much more difficult due to the lack of common interface and system integration.
