Push and Hold is a procedure adopted by some aircraft operators for use when air traffic control (ATC) have advised of an expected significant delay for take off so as to allow their flights to record an on-time departure and/or to clear a gate for re-use. If the airport operator directly controls gate occupation, then the procedure may also be used by them for gate-release purposes. It involves an aircraft ground-positioning, usually under its own power, to what are often specially designated remote parking stands. Here, the engines are shut down and aircraft services are maintained by the use of the APU until engine re-start is authorised by ATC.
