The only issue raised is the absence of ground supervision of the engine restart at the remote parking position. This absence also implies a lack of aircraft fire cover during engine start. This is contrary to the case for normal pre-flight engine starts which take place either on the turn-round parking gate or during/immediately after the pushback, when the ground crew are in attendance and in communication with ground fire extinguishers close to the aircraft. Risk Assessment processes usually note that the area around the aircraft in the restart area can safely be assumed to be clear, while the probability of a hazardous fire during engine start is exteremely low, given the improvements in turbine engine design which have prevailed in recent years. In these circumstances, the lack of external observation and a portable ground fire extinguisher is usually considered acceptable. In respect of cold weather operations, at most airports where push and hold occurs, Ground De/anti Icing will take place after engine restart. However, if is has occurred beforehand, the delay may use up a significant amount of Holdover Time (HOT) which, dependent upon the availability of repeat de icing, may reduce the operational advantage of push and hold.
