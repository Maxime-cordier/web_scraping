Proactive risk management should be based upon Flight crew and ATC awareness of potential safety issues and any procedural mitigations of them. In particular, Operations Manual Procedures should clarify the actual and the potential effect of starting engines without the presence of ground fire cover from a start crew. In certain circumstances, for example the use of particularly remote positions for prolonged holding of departing aircraft with engines shut down, there may be an exceptional case for ground supervision of engine re-starting but in almost all cases, the airport RFFS will be able to reach all parts of the airside area within a relatively short time as dictated by regulatory requirements. For operational purposes, there should be an ATC and/or Company procedure which provides for early notification of an intention to issue and/or accept a push and hold gate departure clearance, so that any appropriate loading of additional fuel for the extra start and taxi and the running of the APU when holding remotely is facilitated.
