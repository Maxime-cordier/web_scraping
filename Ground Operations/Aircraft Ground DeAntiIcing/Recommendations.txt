All flight crew and all other persons involved in the inspection of aircraft for contaminants and the application of ground de/anti icing fluids should receive initial and recurrent training on the subject.. Every AOM or POH (Pilots Operating Handbook) should contain comprehensive and up to date information for flight crew on ground de/anti icing, with special attention being given to incorporation of the latest Holdover Time (HOT) Tables.. Effective Quality Control procedures should be in place to ensure that proper procedures for the delivery of ground de/anti icing by service providers exist and are followed. In addition, Aircraft operators should ensure that Quality Assurance procedures cover Ground De/Anti Icing.. The De/Anti-Icing Code should be used at all times to communicate and record the details of the aircraft treatment carried out to avoid any mis-understandings.. Regarding engine intake de/anti-icing, operators are recommended to follow the advice contained in EASA SIN 2008-29.. If the post de-/anti-icing check is “incorporated” into the de-icing/anti-icing operation, suitable time should be available to allow for the de-icing steam to disperse to ensure that the de-icing operator has good visibility to conduct the post de-icing check. Lighting should also be effective and serviceable for night operations..
