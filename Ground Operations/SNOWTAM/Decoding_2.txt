Only one digit (0-6) is used for each runway third (e.g. 6/4/5). The runway condition code depends on the type and depth of the contaminant and the outside air temperature. Higher numbers indicate better braking action. This item is mandatory.. Item E. Per cent coverage for each runway third. This information is provided only when the runway condition for each runway third (Item D) has been reported as other than 6 and there is a condition description for each runway third (Item G) that has been reported other than DRY. In this case, values 25, 50, 75 or 100 for each runway third are given (e.g. 75/100/50). When the conditions are not reported, "NR" is used instead of numbers.. Item F. Depth of loose contaminant for each runway third in millimetres (e.g. 10/12/10). When the conditions are not reported, "NR" is used. This information is only provided for: standing water slush wet snow dry snow. standing water. slush. wet snow. dry snow. Item G. Condition description for each runway third. This item is mandatory. When the conditions are not reported, "NR" is used. The following words and phrases are used: COMPACTED SNOW DRY SNOW DRY SNOW ON TOP OF COMPACTED SNOW DRY SNOW ON TOP OF ICE FROST ICE SLUSH STANDING WATER WATER ON TOP OF COMPACTED SNOW WET WET ICE WET SNOW WET SNOW ON TOP OF COMPACTED SNOW WET SNOW ON TOP OF ICE DRY (only reported when there is no contaminant).

WET SNOW ON TOP OF COMPACTED SNOW. WET SNOW ON TOP OF ICE. DRY (only reported when there is no contaminant). Item H. Width of runway to which the runway condition codes apply. This item is included if the value in metres is less than the published runway width.. Situational awareness section, containing 11 items (I-T). Elements in the this section for which no information exists, or where the conditional circumstances for publication are not fulfilled, are left out completely. Item I. Reduced runway length, example: "RWY 16R REDUCED TO 2000" Item J. Drifting snow on the runway, example: "DRIFTING SNOW". Item K. Loose sand on the runway, example: "RWY 09 LOOSE SAND" Item L. Chemical treatment on the runway, example: "RWY 15L CHEMICALLY TREATED" Item M. Snow banks on the runway, example: "RWY 27 SNOW BANK L20 FM CL" (snow bank 20 metres to the left of the centreline of runway 27); if the banks are on both sides, LR is used. Item N. Snow banks on a taxiway, example: "TWY A SNOW BANK" Item O. Snow banks adjacent to the runway (penetrating the height profile in the aerodrome snow plan), example: "RWY 12L ADJ SNOW BANKS" Item P. Taxiway conditions (only when the conditions are poor), examples: "TWY B POOR" or "ALL TWYS POOR" Item R. Apron conditions (only when the
