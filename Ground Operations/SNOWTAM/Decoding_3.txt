conditions are poor), examples: "APRON POOR" or "APRON EAST POOR" or "ALL APRONS POOR" Item S. Measured friction coefficient (includes the measured friction coefficient and measuring device). This is only used if the State has an established programme of runway friction measurement using a State-approved measuring device. Item T. Plain language remarks.. Item I. Reduced runway length, example: "RWY 16R REDUCED TO 2000". Item J. Drifting snow on the runway, example: "DRIFTING SNOW".. Item K. Loose sand on the runway, example: "RWY 09 LOOSE SAND". Item L. Chemical treatment on the runway, example: "RWY 15L CHEMICALLY TREATED". Item M. Snow banks on the runway, example: "RWY 27 SNOW BANK L20 FM CL" (snow bank 20 metres to the left of the centreline of runway 27); if the banks are on both sides, LR is used.. Item N. Snow banks on a taxiway, example: "TWY A SNOW BANK". Item O. Snow banks adjacent to the runway (penetrating the height profile in the aerodrome snow plan), example: "RWY 12L ADJ SNOW BANKS". Item P. Taxiway conditions (only when the conditions are poor), examples: "TWY B POOR" or "ALL TWYS POOR". Item R. Apron conditions (only when the conditions are poor), examples: "APRON POOR" or "APRON EAST POOR" or "ALL APRONS POOR". Item S. Measured friction coefficient (includes the measured friction coefficient and measuring device). This is only used if the State has an established programme of runway friction measurement using a State-approved measuring device.. Item T. Plain language remarks.. Example of a SNOWTAM for an aerodrome with two runways (the heading is omitted):
