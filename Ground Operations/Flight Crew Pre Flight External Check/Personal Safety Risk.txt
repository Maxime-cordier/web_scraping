The Ramp at any busy airfield is a hazardous place, with many vehicular and machinery operations taking place in close proximity. Personal Safety when conducting an External Check on an airport ramp requires high levels of Situational Awareness on the ramp. A constant and careful lookout is essential. Attention is required in regard to slippery or hazardous surfaces, vehicles, jet efflux, aircraft aerials, masts and protruding pieces of the aircraft structure such as landing gear doors that can cause injury. Substances such as fuel, oil and hydraulic fluid not only pose a slip hazard but also may drip from the aircraft. It is important to know where to access first aid materials such as eye washes etc. in case of accident to crew or others. Wearing a high visibility tabard or jacket is recommended, even when not mandated by the airport authority. Ambient noise levels of airport aprons can be high and the use of ear defenders should be considered, noting that these may also reduce the wearerâ€™s situational awareness of events taking place in the vicinity. An external check will normally be conducted from ground level; any intended exception to this should be carefully assessed against the risk of falling from height and sustaining injury.
