The foundation of conducting an effective External Check is knowing the aircraft. Damage from a previous flight that is missed during an External Check can be attributed to the new crew who either conducted the External Check poorly or caused it! Knowledge, attention to detail and vigilance will prevent things being missed. As well as checking technical items, crews must keep an eye on the big picture on the ramp and be alert to suspicious people or packages. It is important that flight crew conducting an External Check know: The prescribed content of the external check will be detailed in the Aircraft Operator’s Operations Manual in the form of an expanded check list, and the remarks which follow are generic in nature, highly selective and in no particular order of significance. External checks which are carried out during the hours of darkness require that a torch of effective brightness be carried and used; apron lighting alone is not sufficient. Operating in low temperatures requires particular care for personal safety on slippery or icy surfaces; it also provides an ideal opportunity to inspect the ramp surface and to view the taxiway behind/ in front of the aircraft for any potential pushback or taxy problems. The aircraft operations manual will provide detailed guidance on what if any frost/ ice is permissible on the aircraft structure before flight. The old adage of ‘make it clean and keep it clean’ is usually a good one. Crews conducting External Checks in low temperatures should also: There can occasionally be pressure from ground personnel when asked to carry out de-icing/ anti-icing procedures. Crews must form their own view of the requirement and the final status of their aircraft; it is they who will be flying in it!
