An external check should normally be conducted only after the Aircraft Technical Log is available at the aircraft and has been properly examined by the aircraft commander. However, in practice on commercial airline service, the time available before departure is tight so the crew member carrying out the external check will often commence the External Check immediately on arrival at the aircraft prior to boarding. This will require good communication on eventual arrival on the flight deck regarding any issues from the Aircraft Maintenance Log and what has been seen outside the aircraft. Since some flight crew pre flight internal checks will also be conducted before every flight, the timing of the two sets of checks may need co-ordination to maximise the benefit of the external check and minimize any interference from internal system checks. This is especially relevant prior to the first flight of the day or before any flight which is the first for that flight crew on that particular aircraft that day, if the aircraft is boarded without an informal on-board handover from a previous flight crew. Depending on the provision of ground services, it may be necessary to delay completing the external check until hold loading, refuelling, and other on-stand servicing activities have finished.
