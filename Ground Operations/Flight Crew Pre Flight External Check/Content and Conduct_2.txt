to those panels that were disturbed during maintenance and their associated fastenings.. During turn round external checks after longer flights mainly above the freezing level, a specific check for the possible presence of clear ice on the underside of wing surfaces is appropriate even if the ambient ground temperature is above freezing.. The fitting of covers, flight control locks and landing gear pins should have been recorded in the Aircraft Technical Log, but these items should be checked in case an unrecorded action has taken place.. If propeller restraints are left fitted after a pre flight external inspection, there should be a formal procedure in place to ensure that are removed before any attempt is made to start engines.. Operating in low temperatures requires particular care for personal safety on slippery or icy surfaces; it also provides an ideal opportunity to inspect the ramp surface and to view the taxiway behind/ in front of the aircraft for any potential pushback or taxy problems. The aircraft operations manual will provide detailed guidance on what if any frost/ ice is permissible on the aircraft structure before flight. The old adage of ‘make it clean and keep it clean’ is usually a good one. Crews conducting External Checks in low temperatures should also: pay particular attention to the pitot static system and ensure that all ports/vents are clear.. ensure that landing gear doors are free of slush/ snow/ ice to ensure correct function on departure.. Inspect flying control surfaces and flaps for potential damage from thrown or impacted slush/ snow during landing/ taxying.. There can occasionally be pressure from ground personnel when asked to carry out de-icing/ anti-icing procedures. Crews must form their own view of the requirement and the final status of their aircraft; it is they who will be flying in it!
