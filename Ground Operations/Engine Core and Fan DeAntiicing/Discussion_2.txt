ground operations. This procedure will be undertaken with the aircraft stopped with brakes applied and is accomplished by accelerating the engine to a specified N1 (fan rotation speed) for a specified period of time. The procedure is repeated based on a specified time interval until the aircraft is airborne or the icing conditions no longer exist. Some engine manufacturers also specify a similar procedure in the case of abnormal in-flight vibration after periods in descent in icing conditions at low thrust.
