The purpose of RRM training is to: Decrease the number of incidents of aircraft/equipment damage and personal injuries;. Increase awareness and recognition of human factors and their effect on the aircraft turnaround;. Improve safety barriers against human error;. Decrease operational disruptions;. Increase efficiency;. Increase individualsâ€™ awareness of being part of a larger and more efficient team.. The ultimate goal of RRM is to prevent accidents through reduction of errors during the aircraft turnaround process and management of the effects of errors that still occur. The desired result of the RRM training for each individual ramp worker is to: Create awareness that they are a link in the chain of the turnaround process and that each link is equally important;. Create awareness of team dynamics and provide tools that improve team performance;. Change attitudes and behaviour towards safe operations at the ramp;. Create awareness about typical threats and errors in the turnaround process and provide tools on how to manage them (TEM)..
