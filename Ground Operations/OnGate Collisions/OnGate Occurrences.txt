On-gate collisions most commonly involve the parked aircraft being struck by support equipment but could also be caused by other aircraft manoeuvring or under tow. Whilst being struck by another aircraft is generally obvious to all parties concerned, accidents involving support vehicles may go unnoticed or unreported. The aircraft damage resulting from collisions with ground vehicles or objects can be a significant safety risk if not identified and remedied prior to flight. It is therefore critical that all accidents are reported and that the Flight Crew Pre Flight External Check includes a thorough visual inspection. Some of the more common occurrences include: Aircraft struck by Passenger Boarding Bridge - a faulty bridge or an inadequately trained operator can result in the bridge striking the aircraft causing damage to the aircraft door(s) and/or fuselage. Aircraft struck by ground support equipment - below the wing services make use of a great deal of mechanised equipment such as belt loaders, forklifts, split-loaders, catering trucks and lav and water trucks. Faulty equipment, poorly trained operators, inattention or lack of appropriate marshalling can all lead to collision with the aircraft. Fuel truck damage - Damage from fuel trucks can occur in many ways such as improper or inappropriate positioning of the bowser, damage due to the hose lift platform striking the underside of the wing, improper hose coupling/decoupling, or from failure to detach hoses from the aircraft before moving the fuel truck. Non secured equipment - damage can be caused by improperly secured vehicles or support equipment, such as Unit Load Devices (ULD), being blown against the parked aircraft by the wind or by jet blast. Aircraft struck by other aircraft - other aircraft under tow or under their own power have the potential to strike a parked aircraft due to improper entry to adjacent gates, failure to follow taxi lanes, inattention or malfunction.
