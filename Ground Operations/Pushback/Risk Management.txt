The evidence of accidents and incidents is that there are a number of recurrent features of aircraft damage during pushback: Use of hand signals rather than intercom communication,. Lack of intercom clarity in communications between the aircraft and the ground crew supervisor,. Ground crew totalling less than three people,. Departure from non-airbridge gates,. Failure of vehicle driver to maintain adequate communication with supervisor,. Lack of clearance between horizontal stabilisers of adjacent ‘T’ tail aircraft,. Pushback commenced from a parking position different from that marked,. Ground crew poorly trained or unfamiliar with the immediate pushback environment,. Unserviceable towbars attributable to lack of ownership clarity,. Surface contamination obscuring pavement markings..
