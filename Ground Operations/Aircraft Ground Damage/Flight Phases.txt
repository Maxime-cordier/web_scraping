Most ground occurrences happen when the aircraft is parked, e.g. during maintenance, loading and unloading. Relatively high number of events involve airbridges. The parts that usually sustain damage in such cases are the fuselage (especially the doors) and the engines. The next most risky phase is Aircraft Towing. Incidents during this phase often result in damage to the landing gear, wings or empennage. Taxiing aircraft participate in ground events relatively less often. A frequent outcome of such incidents is wingtip damage.
