A LWES is an automated weather measurement system that determines the Liquid Water Equivalent (LWE) rate in frozen or freezing precipitation. The system then uses the LWE rate to determine the holdover time (HOT) and/or the check time (CT) for an anti-icing fluid. The HOT is used to decide how long a fluid will provide protection in given weather conditions, and the CT is used to decide if the fluid is still providing protection in given weather conditions. The system is highly automated and typically uses a central processor that receives input from a number of sensors. As a minimum, these sensors include a temperature sensor, a precipitation type sensor, and a LWE precipitation measurement device. A wind sensor may be included. The system uses the input from the sensors to calculate the applicable holdover and check times and transmits them to the user via ACARS or via a web based application in near-real time providing minute by minute updates. Information is currently available at certain airports on a subscription basis.
