A Liquid Water Equivalent System (LEWS) is an automated weather measurement system that determines the Liquid Water Equivalent (LWE) rate in conditions of frozen or freezing precipitation. Hold Over Time Determination System (HOTDS) is the FAA term for a system that produces liquid water equivalent (LWE) measurement and provides an acceptable alternative to Holdover Tables. Check Time (CT) is a time in the past that indicates whether an aircraft’s anti-icing fluid is still providing protection in the given conditions. Incorporating real-time snowfall rates, the algorithm begins with the current time and integrates the fluid’s loss in protection capacity rate backwards in time, minute by minute, until it determines sufficient precipitation has fallen for the protection capability to be exhausted. The time at which this occurs is displayed to the user as check time and is updated every minute. The check time is compared to the time the aircraft was anti-iced. As long as the time the aircraft was anti-iced remains more recent than the check time, the fluid is still providing protection.
