During winter conditions, safe operation requires that any contamination be removed from critical aircraft surfaces and, in conditions of active precipitation, that anti-icing fluid be applied to the aircraft to prevent any recontamination in the interval between the Aircraft Ground De/Anti-Icing process and takeoff. Published Holdover Time (HOT) tables provide a time interval that an anti-icing fluid will normally remain effective. These tables are developed based on four primary criteria. These are: The time interval available for safe operation, as provided in the published HOT tables, is based on the assumption that the temperature, and type and rate of precipitation remain constant. However, as fluid failure is based on the dilution caused by melting precipitation, it is the liquid water content of the precipitation that most accurately defines the time interval to fluid failure. There two primary factors that can diminish the reliability of the published HOT tables. These are:
