All light-display stop position indicator systems are provided with emergency stop buttons at both ramp level and on the air bridge platform for ground staff use. Staff must take care to distinguish these buttons from potentially similar stop buttons for the moveable airbridge that cut its electrical power supply; it the wrong one is pressed, power to the SEG system control and display may also be lost, including illumination of the emergency stop element.
