There is a huge variety of stand entry guidance (SEG) systems in use, which may be a marshaller with bats or lighted wands or a number of different fully- or semi-automated systems. The automated systems may provide azimuth (centreline) guidance or stop position information or both. Some modern systems can automatically identify aircraft type and this information is illuminated above the guidance information (e.g. "B747") to inform the pilot that guidance will be type specific; they also incorporate warnings (e.g. "STOP") if the system goes off line or if entry speed is too fast (e.g. "Slow Down") >10km/6kt. Some systems require the ground staff to configure the guidance system for the aircraft type and sometimes, the pilot must determine which marks on a generic display are applicable to his particular type. With no international or regional standardization of automatic SEG systems, different systems may be installed at different terminals at the same airport or even in different stands on the same terminal. Flight crews may find the relevant information for any particular gate difficult to locate. Late allocation or changes of gate may make it impracticable for flight crew to pre-brief themselves on unfamiliar systems without stopping the aircraft prior to proceeding onto stand (as indicated in AAIB Bulletin 12/2009 in Further Reading). If at any time a pilot is not satisfied that the system in use is providing clear and correct guidance then the aircraft should be stopped and assistance sought.
