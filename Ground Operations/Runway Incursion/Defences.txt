Available defences relate to both the occurrence of runway incursions and the danger thereby created. The role of Safety Nets as a last line of defence against error is increasingly valuable at busy airports with complex movement areas. Not in any order of significance these defences include: Maintenance of situation awareness by flight crew and others using the manoeuvring area, specifically in respect of their own location in relation to active runways, and that of other aircraft and vehicles relative to active runways.. Maintenance of situation awareness by TWR and GND ATCOs in respect of aircraft and vehicle disposition and movements near to active runways. Flight Crew use of the TCAS display to provide situational awareness of other aircraft both in the air and on the ground.. Effective flight crew use of appropriate features of RAAS if installed. Where installed, effective procedures for the use of Enhanced Vision Systems (EVS) for improved awareness of runway occupancy. Use of ICAO Standard Phraseology at all times to minimise any risk of clearance confusion.. Presence of ICAO standard Runway Markings and Taxiway Surface Markings and Signs. Presence of ICAO standard Runway Lighting and Taxiway Lighting including the installation of Runway Status Lights (RWSL) and Runway Holding Point Lighting.. Controllers working traffic where the flight crew are not native speakers of English should pay particular attention to their speech clarity, use only standard phraseology and make a particular effort to closely monitor readbacks of taxi clearances..
