Airports operating in low visibility have green centreline lighting on principal taxiways and blue edge lighting on minor taxiways. Where green centreline lighting is provided, blue taxiway edge lighting may also be provided as additional guidance on sections of taxiway that are assessed as potentially difficult to negotiate. It should be noted that green taxiway centreline lighting may also be installed on a runway just prior to a designated exit taxiway in order to give lead-off guidance. Lead-on guidance from designated runway holding points onto runway centerlines may also be provided but if it is, it will be illuminated only if a specific clearance to enter that runway from that position is current. The edge of aprons, turning and holding areas are usually marked by blue lights. Airports which operate at night but not in low visibility will have either green centerline or blue edge lighting or a combination of the two at the discretion of the Airport Operator. Unless lighting is selectable (see below) then where any part of a taxiway equipped with centreline lighting is within a designated ILS-sensitive area (or is so close to a runway as to constitute an obstruction for aircraft landing or taking off from that runway) then that part of the centerline lighting will be marked with alternating green and yellow lights and aircraft and vehicles should not stop in such areas without obtaining explicit ATC approval.
