The evidence of accidents and incidents is that there are a number of recurrent factors leading to aircraft damage during towing: A failure to maintain overall Situational Awareness of other traffic regardless of whether a required ATC clearance is held. Inadequate RTF skills on the part of the persons responsible for communicating with ATC from the towing team. Inadequate awareness of aircraft dimensions and turning arcs by the ground crew towing. Lack of clearance between horizontal stabilisers of a towed ‘T’ tail aircraft when it is turning in proximity to another similar ‘T’ tail type.. Failure to keep towed aircraft on the taxiway centreline or other taxi guidance line.. Inadvertent or otherwise inappropriate brake application during towing by personnel ‘riding the brakes’. Towing collision risk is exacerbated by the conduct of such operations during the hours of darkness or in poor ground visibility and procedures should effectively address and/or constrain such operations.
