FOD can cause damage in a number of ways, the most notable being: Damaging aircraft engines if ingested;. Cutting aircraft tyres;. Lodging in aircraft mechanisms preventing them from operating properly;. Injuring people afer being propelled by a jet blast or prop wash.. The resulting damage is estimated to cost the aerospace industry $4 billion a year. A dramatic example of FOD damage is the loss of the Air France Concorde, which struck FOD on the runway during take-off from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in 2000 (see Accidents & Incidents section for details).
