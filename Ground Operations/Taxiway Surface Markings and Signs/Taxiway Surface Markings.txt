All painted makings on the pavement surface are coloured yellow. There are five types: If only one type is present, it will always be the former. Where there is more than one RTHP, all the additional ones will be of the second type. All RTHP should be located so that there is safe clearance between any aircraft holding there and any aircraft passing in front of the holding aircraft, subject to it being correctly positioned with no part of the aircraft on or beyond the line. There is no guarantee of any clearance behind a holding aircraft.
