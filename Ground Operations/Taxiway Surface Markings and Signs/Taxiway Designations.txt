Standard taxiway designation is by use of single letters of the alphabet for each discrete taxiway as, for example 'A' for taxiway Alpha, 'B' for Bravo etc. The letters 'O', 'I' and 'X' are not used. At large airports where there are more taxiways than letters of the alphabet, double letter designators may be used for minor taxiways or taxiway stubs. Local exceptions, in the form of additions to the standard designation system, may be found as, for example, with the use of ‘Inner’ and ‘Outer’ and at large airports, principal taxiways may be split into zones or ‘blocks’ and numbered uniquely.
