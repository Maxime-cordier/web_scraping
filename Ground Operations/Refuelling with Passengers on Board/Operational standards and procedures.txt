The risks associated with passengers embarking, disembarking or remaining on board the aircraft during fuelling should be considered, and effective procedures to mitigate those risks should be established. These procedures should: be designed to enable rapid evacuation of all occupants of an aircraft, including any PRMs, should the need arise;. reduce the risk of ignition;. ensure the ground area into which passengers would evacuate is kept clear of equipment and obstacles;. ensure vehicles attending the aircraft do not impede access to the site by Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) vehicles and personnel, or the egress of passengers evacuating the aircraft;. take account of local requirements in respect of the attendance of the RFFS;. in the case of medical flights, take into account the ability, or inability, of the patient and attendant staff to effect a rapid evacuation from the aircraft;. take into account the ability of those whose mobility is impaired to effect a rapid evacuation from the aircraft;. comply with the relevant authority requirements.. Refuelling with passenger on board may or may not be an option depending on the grade of fuel involved: Refuelling with wide cut gasoline type fuel (JET B, JP4 or equivalent) or when a mixture with these types of fuel might occur, is not permitted with passengers boarding, on board or disembarking. In general, this type of fuel can be used as an alternative to Jet A-1 but because it is more difficult to handle (higher flammability) there is only significant demand in very cold climates where its better cold weather performance is important.. Refuelling with Kerosene (JET A, JET A1 JP8, TS1, RT, TH or equivalent, in accordance with the approved Aircraft Flight Manual), is allowed when passengers are boarding, on board, or disembarking..
