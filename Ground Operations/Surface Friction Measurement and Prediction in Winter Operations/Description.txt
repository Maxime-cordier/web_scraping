In 2006, after investigating a number of accidents and serious incidents involving reduced runway surface friction over a ten year period, the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) began a Study to review this subject in depth. Thirty Norwegian Incidents and Accidents involving runway surface friction, which occurred between February 1999 and April 2000, were analysed. The majority of these events occurred at six airports - Svalbard, Harstad/Narvik, Tromso, Oslo Gardermoen, Bardufoss and Sandefjord/Torp. Twelve were the subject of individual Accident or Serious Incident Investigation Reports and one more is the subject of an ongoing investigation. The Results of this Study were published in English on 5 May 2011. The Findings and resultant generic Safety Recommendations are, in keeping with the AIBN mandate, focused on the Norwegian situation. However the Report contains much of potential interest to those based in other countries where are also unresolved problems with both the measurement of runway surface friction and the association of such measurements with actual aircraft braking performance. In the words of the AIBN, the investigation looked at: “the general framework for winter operations and the factors related to meteorology, runway, regulations and operations that reduce the safety margins and increase the uncertainty on contaminated and slippery runways”.
