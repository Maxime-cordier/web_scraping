Following a lead in support for the development of the Remote Tower concept by both the German ANSP Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS), and the Swedish ANSP Luftfatsverket (LFV) over many years, the world's first operational approval for routine provision of Remote Tower Service was given to Swedish ANSP LFV by the Swedish Transport Agency Transportstyrelsen on 31 October 2014. This approval was then first used for ATS at Örnsköldsvik Airport which, since 21 April 2015, has been provided from Sundsvall, which is some 80 NM to the south west. An extension of the system to two other aerodromes also controlled from Sundsvall will make the latter the world's first RTC. The equipment being used is manufactured by Saab which continues to work with LFV to jointly promote the installation and operation of the system both within and outside Sweden. Aided by SJU funding under the SESAR Programme, the Saab system is to be installed at the Irish airports at Cork and Shannon by the Irish ANSP the Irish Aviation Authority and operated as a SESAR Large Scale Demonstration Project, in conjunction with the Dublin Airport Authority and Stobart Air. Both airports will be controlled from a RTC at Dublin Airport and it is planned to commence operational trials in the first half of 2016. Elsewhere, German ANSP Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS), which was also instrumental in developing the RTS concept with operational trials at Dresden, is planning to introduce a similar system at Saarbrücken Airport in 2017. This will be provided by Austrian company Frequentis and will allow Saarbrücken to be controlled from an RTC at Leipzig with both Erfurt and Dresden Airports to be subsequently also converted to RTS and linked to the same RTC.
