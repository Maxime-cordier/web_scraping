Some larger airports, for example London Heathrow, currently have contingency arrangements to cover any temporary non-availability of the normal TWR/GND control facility due to fire, technical failure or a security issue. However, these alternatives have no replication of the visual element and are unable to continue service at the normal level - the Heathrow system is believed to be capable of handling about 80% of normal traffic - so the additional functionality of RTS is seen as a way of increasing the capacity of such a 'standby' system to near 100% of normal.
