Airport lighting is controlled by air traffic controllers (ATCOs) at towered airports. At non-towered airports, the lights may be on a timer, or where a Flight Service Station (FSS) is located at an airport, the FSS personnel may control the lighting. A pilot may request various light systems be turned on or off and also request a specified intensity, if available, from ATC or FSS personnel. At selected non-towered airports, an ARCAL (Aircraft Radio Control of Aerodrome Lighting) system is installed. This system allows the pilot to control the lighting by using the aircraft radio. This is done by selecting a specified frequency and clicking the radio microphone a specified number of times within a specified time period (for example, 7 "clicks" within 5 seconds on frequency 121.7).
