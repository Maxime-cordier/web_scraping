Routine checks by cabin crew of the boarding cards of joining passengers as they arrive at the aircraft, to check that they are getting on the correct aircraft, can provide an extra check on the correct release of passengers by ground crew at the boarding gate. Whilst computerised seat assignment and passenger on-load validation built into many DCS systems has eliminated a lot of errors made in the older manual processing systems, a new type of error is now prevalent which occurs when ground staff manually override the automatic system to accommodate late changes or other specific problems.
