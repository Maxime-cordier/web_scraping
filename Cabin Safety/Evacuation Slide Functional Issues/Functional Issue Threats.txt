Initial and recurrent training of cabin crews cover how functional issues might affect any type of escape slide. Slide deployment, inflation and stable positioning can be disrupted as described in the following examples. A prominent functional issue appearing in recent studies is strong wind shifting/lifting the slide into an unuseable condition or position in relation to the aircraft cabin. The applicable part of the relevant European regulation (EASA CS 25.810) states: “The assist means must have the capability to deploy in 46 kilometres/hour (25-knot) winds directed at it from the most critical angle with any engine(s) simultaneously running at ground idle, and to remain useable after full deployment to evacuate passengers and crew to the ground.”. Another potential functional issue is the scenario in which the flight attendant makes errors in safety procedures while disarming a door and actuating the exit-opening mechanism. The door opens at high speed with extreme force. Residual pressurisation may pull the flight attendant out the door and deploy the slide, possibly damaging the slide enough to render it unuseable, seriously injuring the flight attendant and striking others outside the aircraft.. Another potential functional issue is inadvertently allowing cabin waste items or excessive debris to interfere with the mechanisms used to arm/disarm and close/open the exit door, interfering with normal slide deployment and inflation.. Another potential functional issue is mishandling or throwing carry-on baggage through a door — typically when passengers have disregarded crewmembers’ evacuation instructions to leave carry-on baggage on the aircraft — also damaging the slide enough to render it unuseable..
