Although the majority of battery-powered wheelchairs carried in holds are powered by a gas-electrolyte which is non-spillable, incident experience suggests that the loading supervision associated with their carriage may not always achieve the necessary minimum standards. The essential requirements for hold stowage must be met if hazardous outcomes are to be avoided: The battery must be securely attached to the wheelchair they power.. The motor must be protected from inadvertent operation by positive deactivation using whatever method applies. It should be made particularly clear to loaders that application of the brake is not sufficient.. The battery must be protected from a short circuit - this may be achieved if the battery is routinely contained in a box attached to the wheelchair. Stowage must be such as to preclude damage to the associated wiring as a consequence of the in-flight movement of baggage or other hold contents.. It should be noted that the applicable ICAO Instructions do not require disconnection of non-spillable batteries because it is often very difficult to do and, if not done properly, can increase the risk of a fire. Only if deactivation cannot be achieved should disconnection be considered. If this is done, the battery terminals must be protected against short circuit, for example by the effective insulation of exposed terminals. If spillable batteries are encountered, reference should be made to the restrictions detailed in the Technical Instructions.
