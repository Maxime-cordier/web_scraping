Dry cell alkaline batteries, including the common AAA, AA, C, D, 9-volt and button cell types and dry cell rechargeable batteries such as Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) and Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) represent much lower quantifiable risk of fire provided that precautions against unintended activation or short circuiting of the terminals in loose packed batteries are taken. However, lithium-based batteries can be extremely flammable because of this and the much greater power contained within and are subject to restrictions on carriage both as cabin and checked baggage.
