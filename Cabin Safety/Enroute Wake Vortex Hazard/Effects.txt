The potential for significant wake vortex turbulence in the cruise is greatest where an aircraft is following a similar track to another heavier one ahead that is either at the same level or the next available level above. The extent of the ‘in trail’ case can be extrapolated to climb and descent but in all cases, the important thing to note is that, especially for following aircraft two categories or more below that of the leading aircraft, significant wake turbulence can be encountered at greater separation than is required in en route airspace where radar control service is provided. In the case of crossing tracks, it has been found that the time interval necessary to avoid creating a wake vortex hazard is 3 minutes. Sudden uncommanded roll moments may occur which, in extreme cases, can be beyond the absolute power of the flying controls or the prevailing response of the flight crew to counteract. The high rate of roll may cause uncommanded disconnection of the autopilot and transient or terminal loss of control. En route in-trail uncommanded roll can be similarly caused to smaller aircraft by the effect of larger ones, which may be ahead at a higher level. Note that if the generating aircraft is climbing or descending rapidly (greater than 1000 fpm) then a significant wake vortex may persist across several flight levels. If the generator aircraft is descending, this means that a WVE can occur above the position of the generator aircraft at the time of the encounter. A cross-track encounter en route is likely to lead to only one or two sharp 'jolts' as the vortices are crossed. In either en route case, injuries to unsecured occupants can result, both passengers and cabin crew. Since most operators ensure that passengers are secured during intermediate and final approach and during initial climb after take off, it is cabin crew who will be most at risk of injury if they are not yet secured during the later stages of an approach.
