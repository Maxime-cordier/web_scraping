International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has defined a four tier threat level hierarchy. Although all National Aviation Authorities (NAA) do not follow these specific definitions, they provide valuable guidance to operators in determining the seriousness of an unruly passenger incident and in developing their policies on appropriate level of response. The ICAO level of threat specifics are as follows: Level 1 — Disruptive behavior (verbal);. Level 2 — Physically abusive behavior;. Level 3 — Life-threatening behavior (or display of a weapon);. Level 4 — Attempted or actual breach of the flight crew compartment..
