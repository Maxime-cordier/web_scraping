An accelerated international development program resulted in the first vaccine being approved for emergency use in late 2020. In many regions, health care workers, other medical professionals, and elderly/vulnerable populations were prioritized for early vaccinations. At least 15 different vaccines have been administered. As of 23 May 2023, more than 13.3 billion vaccine does had been administered, including booster doses in some regions. Vaccines reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. The vaccines have been shown to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and preventing COVID-19. In addition, people who are up to date on vaccines, including booster doses where eligible, are likely to have stronger protection against variants. More information is available on the WHO variant tracking website.
