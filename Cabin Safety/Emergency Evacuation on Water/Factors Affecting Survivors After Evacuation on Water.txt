It is essential that in order to survive a water ditching and be rescued successfully, some basic factors must be taken into consideration. These factors are: When a person suddenly comes into contact with extremely cold water, they experience a cold shock response. This phenomenon is similar to jumping into a freezing swimming pool on a hot summer day. Immediately, the person will hyperventilate and take uncontrollable, deep and fast breaths for the next one to three minutes. If a person goes underwater in this state, he/she could swallow water and drown. However, the cold shock response is short-lived and the associated risk subsides fairly quickly. Survivors of a ditching will not only be unprepared for the sudden exposure to low water temperatures, they are also likely to experience increased body-cooling rates due to the evaporating fuel from the aircraft wreckage. Survivors are vulnerable to hypothermia which may set in when the core body temperature drops below the minimum temperature required for normal metabolism and bodily functions at approximately 35Â°C. Ditching is often a high-impact event, which is likely to result in the break-up of the fuselage. Spilt fuel could possibly be ignited, leading to a post-impact fire. Even if ignition sources were suppressed by the waters, the inhalation and ingestion of fuel vapors can pose severe health risks to the survivors.
