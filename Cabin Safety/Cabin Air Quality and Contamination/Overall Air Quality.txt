Results of a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) study released in 2017 said that cabin/cockpit air quality is similar to or better than what is observed in normal indoor environments, such as offices, schools and dwellings. The EASA study comprised 69 contaminant measurement flights performed between July 2015 and June 2016. No occupational exposure limits or guidelines were violated during flights conducted to assess air quality, said the study. “To state the obvious, there is no contaminant-free indoor environment,” the report said. “The aircraft cabin is no exception. However, due to the exceptional high air-exchange rates in aircraft, the cabin air has been proven to be less polluted compared to normal indoor environments. … Volatile contaminations in the cabin are thus depleted quickly. Since the bleed air itself is suspected to be the source of hazard contaminants such as OPC [organophosphorus compounds], a special attention was paid to the detection of TCP [tricresyl phosphate] as a marker for engine oil contamination and the present physical ventilation situation in aircraft.” In its Medical Manual, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), says “…to summarise the current body of knowledge, aircraft cabin air quality during normal operation is perfectly acceptable and often better than other well accepted indoor environments.”
