The single simple and most effective method of preventing infection is the practice of good personal hygiene. This will greatly limit the spread of infectious material. Simply washing hands will considerably reduce the risk of contamination from hand to mouth/nose, foodstuffs and other surfaces. It is recognised that due to aircraft design separate crew/food preparation washing facilities are not always available. The use of appropriate biocide wipes/gels as a substitute method for hand hygiene will assist in reducing possible cross-contamination.
