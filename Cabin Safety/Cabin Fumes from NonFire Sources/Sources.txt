Most modern passenger aircraft are equipped with pressurised, climate controlled, cabins. In spite of the aircraft designersâ€™ intentions, unwanted fumes frequently permeate the interior of the aircraft. Open doors and hatches as well as certain on-board sources can introduce fumes to the cabin environment. However the usual path of entry for fumes is via the aircraft pressurisation and air conditioning systems. The majority of passenger aircraft utilise bleed air from the engine or auxiliary power unit (APU) to pressurize and heat or cool the aircraft cabin. As a consequence, any contaminants introduced into the engine/APU compressor prior to the point from which the bleed air is extracted may result in the appearance of corresponding fumes in the passenger cabin and flight deck.
