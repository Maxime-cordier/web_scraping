Provisions regarding the requirements for toilet compartment fire detection and suppression equipment are contained in the relevant documents (e.g. for the EU such a document is “Certification Specifications and AMC for Large Aeroplanes CS-25” by EASA). Although there may be slight differences from country to country, the main points usually are: Lavatory fire protection requiremets apply to aeroplanes with a passenger capacity of 20 or more.. Installation of smoke detectors that provide warning signals in the cockpit and in the passenger cabin. It is worth noting that these detectors are not considered critical for the flight safety and therefore the flight continues normally in case of detector malfunction.. Installation of automatic fire extinguishers in the lavatory trash receptacles.. Placing “no smoking” signs on both sides of lavatory doors.. Informing the passengers during the in-flight briefing that smoking is prohibited in the lavatories.. Placing ashtrays at conspicuous locations both inside and outside the lavatories regardless of whether smoking is allowed in any other part of the aeroplane.. The use of Halon in lavatory fire extinguishers is restricted. For the EU, the cut-off date is 31st December 2011 and the end date is 31st December 2020. Research and testing have shown that there are suitable alternatives meeting the standards for effectiveness, volume, weight and toxicology..
