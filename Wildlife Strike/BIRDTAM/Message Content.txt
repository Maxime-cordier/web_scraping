BIRDTAM is the name given to an AFTN message, formatted to a specific NATO standard, which was originated by military services to provide information about bird strike risk, particularly in lower level airspace. The coverage area is relatively small, confined mainly to Northern Europe. A BIRDTAM is based on observed bird activity, be it human observation or radar analysis, and predicted bird movement. Activity location is identified by use of a two letter grid reference assigned to a one degree by one degree area. A BIRDTAM will contain the following information: A typical BIRDTAM as issued by the German Bundeswehr Geoinformation Office is as follows: BIRDTAM NUMBER: 0280 EFFECTIVE TIME: 10 MAR 16:16 EXPIRATION TIME: 10 MAR 20:30 INTENSITY LEVEL: 5 AFFECTED AREA: MC LOW ALTITUDE: SFC HIGH ALTITUDE: 6000 Current BIRDTAM information, as issued by the German Bundeswehr Geoinformation Office and approved by the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), can be found online at the FAA NOTAM website. This site includes a graphic showing both the coverage area and the grid identification system and also highlights the areas affected by the BIRDTAM(s) currently in effect.
