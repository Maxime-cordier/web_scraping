A BIRDTAM is a specialized NOTAM providing information regarding bird strike risk or warning, particularly for low level airspace. Unlike ASHTAM or SNOWTAM, BIRDTAM is not an official ICAO term and is not in universal use. However, the term BIRDTAM is recognised in the European Aeronautical Information System Database (EAD) and has its own Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network (AFTN) address.
