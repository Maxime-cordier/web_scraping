An aircraft is hit by birds while on final approach to land - should the pilot continue the approach or initiate a go around/missed approach? Having encountered birds, the question to be answered is "what is the damage to the aircraft and what effect will this have on the safe conduct of the flight?". The full extent of any damage, to the engines and/or the control surfaces and landing gear, may not be apparent until applying power, configuring, or manoeuvring the aircraft. It might therefore be the case that, if a go-around is initiated, the pilots rapidly finds themselves in a situation where the runway is disappearing beneath them but the aircraft cannot safely fly a missed approach. Therefore, in the above scenario, it is advisable to continue the approach and land.
