Whilst Bird Strike Reporting is a reactive response to the potential hazard, there is no alternative widely-available means of monitoring potentially hazardous bird activity and this has been recognised by Regulatory action to improve the extent of reporting. However, whilst the recording of bird strikes is a very important part of understanding both actual and relative risks, it has to be recognised that: Very few bird strikes out of the total reported are hazardous to continued safe flight. Only a relatively small minority of bird strikes, especially in jurisdictions with a healthy reporting culture, cause damage, although the overall cost of repairing bird strike damage is high and damage to individual aircraft or their engines can be very expensive to repair.. The relationship between the risk of any birdstrike and the risk of one which is hazardous to continued safe flight is unclear and there is no evidence to suggest that it is linear so that hazard severity based upon all-species strike rates, even if moderated by aircraft movements, is unhelpful..
