and must be able to differentiate two standard avian targets when separated by 165 ft (50 m) or less in both range and azimuth at range of up to 1 nm. The FAA is engaged in ongoing research to determine the efficacy of using radar and other sensors to detect and track birds. The FAA most recently conducted research on the integration of bird radar into an airport's operational environment with avian radar deployments at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. Additional studies are being conducted for development of a new concept for integrating avian radar data into the air traffic control tower. The concept is known as the wildlife surveillance concept (WiSC) and has been designed to streamline and improve the flow of pertinent information about active hazardous bird activity through ATC to pilots.
