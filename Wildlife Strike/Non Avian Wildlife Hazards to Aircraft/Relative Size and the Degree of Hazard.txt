Non-avian wildlife hazards are almost exclusively mammals. The relative sizes of the objects in any aircraft/mammal conflict is understandably significant. An encounter between a particular animal and a large transport aircraft might produce relatively insignificant damage whereas if that aircraft is much smaller, the consequences of an impact may even lead directly to an accident. A few animals such as bears and large deer species are so large that the safety of an aircraft of any size would be at risk if one was hit. Fortunately, many larger animal species rarely feature in aircraft impact events although some species like deer, elk and moose, which see safety in staying close to other animals, can raise the likelihood of an aircraft encounter having an impact outcome by just this tendency. It has been suggested that an appropriate general guideline for a minimum size for reporting of non-flying animals actually or potentially hazarding aircraft taking off or landing should be 1 kg.
