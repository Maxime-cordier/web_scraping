This article describes the hazard to the safe flight of aircraft from wildlife other than birds. Airport Risk Assessment and Control of bird hazards is usually carried out within the wider context of wildlife hazards. As with birds, most animals quickly adapt to the normal noise and activity conditions of a chosen habitat and have no innate fear of aircraft or vehicles on airports. Non-Avian wildlife hazards to aircraft usually involve ground dwelling mammals, which limits the potential consequences of impact, but bats - the only flying mammals - are a notable and occasionally significant exception.
