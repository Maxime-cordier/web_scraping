The chances of recorded incidents involving particular species, obviously depend upon not only propensity to record but on both the extent to which a species is present and the density of aircraft movements. For these reasons, animal species recorded regularly in such incidents are biased towards those found in North America and Europe. Deer species are top of the list overall with over 40 deer strikes per year regularly occurring in North America, many to light aircraft on private flights at airstrips where the operator does not attempt to exclude animals and is not required to. White-tailed and mule deer are most commonly involved. Coyotes are the next animal most often encountered in North America whereas in Europe, red foxes are often the most common sighting at airports of all sizes although they are only quite infrequently hit by aircraft.
