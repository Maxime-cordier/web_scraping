As a TWR Controller: Routinely scan for the presence of flocking birds, especially large ones, in the vicinity of runways about to be used for a take off or landing, including the initial climb out / final approach paths;. Maintain close contact with the Airport Operator and request and coordinate bird dispersal actions before take-off and landing, as necessary;. If unable to get the birds removed, communicate any relevant presence of birds to pilots with their location and apparent direction of movement;. Include appropriate cautionary advice in the ATIS recording (example: "Flock of birds in the vicinity of/near the intersection of/on the approach to (as appropriate) runways 24 and 19");. In case of persistent bird activity, perhaps attributable to a particular attractant but also including active migration routes, NOTAMs should be raised and cancelled when the threat has passed. At some military aerodromes, a BIRDTAM might be promulgated instead of a NOTAM..
