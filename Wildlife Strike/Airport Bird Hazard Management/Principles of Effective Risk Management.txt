The extent of a bird hazard at any particular airport location is widely variable. While there are many potential solutions and strategies available, not all are necessarily relevant to the particular circumstances of a specific airport. The most important action, upon which any risk management strategy must be founded, is knowing the nature of the (unmanaged) hazard. This may vary by time of day and seasonally and must be related to to the likely pattern of aircraft movements. Once a risk management plan is in place, it must be recognised that it is still necessary to monitor proactively for any detectable change in the assumptions upon which the plan was based. This is necessary in order to try and avoid complete reliance upon the reaction to an increase in the level of a recorded hazard as the trigger for any modification to the plan. As with all risk management, an Safety Management System approach to risk management is essential. The activity must be founded on accountability, co-operation between stakeholders, proper documentation and an effective review procedure. All this needs to be facilitated by human and financial resources compatible with the task.
