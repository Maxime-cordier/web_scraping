If any improvement is to be realised in better assessing, mitigating or controlling bird strike effects on aviation safety, then it is of outmost importance that reporting of bird strike occurrences improves significantly.

However there appears to be no combined effort in Europe to collect all relevant occurrences, especially those that did not lead to a bird strike.
