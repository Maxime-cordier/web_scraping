Habitat features, including open areas of grass and water as well as shrubs and trees, provide food and roosting sites for birds. Even transient water accumulation on uneven pavements can be a significant bird attractant.. Landfill and other waste disposal sites often attract large numbers of birds if they are not carefully managed.. Some types of agricultural activity, on or in the vicinity of an airport, may attract birds.. Migrating birds often follow well-defined flight paths in considerable numbers. This can create a hazard if the flight paths are near an airport.. Airports in coastal locations often have a much higher level of un-managed bird activity than do inland airports.. Most airports contain considerable areas of grass within their perimeters. Even dry grass can be attractive as a loitering area for birds by day or night..
