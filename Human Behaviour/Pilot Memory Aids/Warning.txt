Mnemonics, and other memory hooks, should not replace the use of checklists and the applicable legal and company requirements need to be followed. However, when developing any memory aid consideration should be given to the following questions: memorability – can it be recalled easily?. reliability – can each item be remembered accurately and consistently?. relevance and need – is there a better, safer, procedure or system available?. confusion – is it possible that the memory aid, or elements of it, can be confused for another?. test – has the memory aid been tested under operational and emergency conditions?. system - if there is suddenly a need to develop a memory aid what has happened?.
