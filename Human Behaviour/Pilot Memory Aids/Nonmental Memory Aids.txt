Pilots will use the aircraft displays to aid their memories. Mechanical or electronic “bugs” are used to indicate key information e.g. required track, take off/aproach speeds.. When included in a pilot’s scan, digital or analogue displays provide reminders e.g. radio frequencies, cleared altitude.. EFIS can sometimes be “arranged” by the user to provide information on demand an/or in a preferred layout.. When the situation demands, pilots have been known to use other visual memory aids, e.g. dayglow sticky labels on pulled circuit breakers, or a brightly coloured clipboard placed across throttles. These may be constant reminders that e.g. a system is not working, or fuel dumping is currently in progress. The “ultimate” pilot memory aid is another crew member, specifically designated to pass information at a specific time, or when specific conditions are met e.g. the pilot monitoring calling 1000 feet to level or monitoring the anti-icing holdover time remaining. This short section highlights the importance of Crew Resource Management (CRM) in aiding a pilot’s memory.
