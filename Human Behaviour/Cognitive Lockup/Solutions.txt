Decision Support Tools: Tools that assist pilots in recognising the relative priorities of tasks, allowing them to focus on the more urgent task and so reduce the likelihood of cognitive lockup.. Training: Simulator exercise scenarios that expose pilots to situations where new, more urgent, tasks arise when they are dealing with an existing task reinforce awareness of the need to continuously assess and prioritise tasks. Greater understanding of aircraft systems may also reduce the likelihood of cognitive lockup.. Crew Resource Management: Separation of tasks and roles between pilots, for example, by the captain passing control of the aircraft to the first officer while the captain deals with the malfunction, reduces the risk of both pilots fixating on the malfunction..
