The potential consequences of cognitive lockup are illustrated by the 29th December 1972 accident involving an Eastern Airlines aircraft which crashed northwest of Miami. Following a missed approach, because of a suspected nose gear malfunction, the aircraft climbed to 2,000ft MSL and proceeded on a westerly heading. The three flight crew members and a jump seat occupant became engrossed in the malfunction. In its aircraft accident report (NTSB-AAR-73-14), the NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was "the failure of the flight crew to monitor the flight instruments during the final four minutes of flight, and to detect an unexpected descent soon enough to prevent impact with the ground. Preoccupation with a malfunction of the nose landing gear position indicating system distracted the crew's attention from the instruments and allowed the descent to go unnoticed."
