Prevention of Base Effect hinges on good airmanship and discipline. Tenets of good discipline include: A well-disciplined pilot will follow the appropriate rules and procedures, both at his/her home aerodrome and while away, unless an emergency situation compels a deviation. A disciplined controller will follow standard procedures and protocols and take steps to ensure that operators within their area of responsibility are compliant with all applicable rules, regulations and procedures. The benefits of elimination, or even reduction, of Base Effect are significant in the context of enhancing safety of flight.
