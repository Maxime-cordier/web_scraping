Virtually every aerodrome has locally-based aircraft, pilots and, in many cases, air traffic controllers. Over time, these individuals become very familiar with the aerodrome environment, traffic flows and ATM procedures. This knowledge, combined with a degree of complacency, can, over time, lead to the acceptance of localised deviations to standard procedures and protocols. To a large extent, this "deviance normalisation" results from an enhanced level of familiarity and "mutual trust" amongst the local operators and between the operators and local air traffic control. Although these modified local procedures might work reasonably well on a day to day basis, they may be deficient should transient aircraft be present, in the event that there is a mixture of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) traffic or if an unplanned event or emergency occurs.
