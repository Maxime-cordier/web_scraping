Trust refers to a person’s, cadre’s, or organisation’s, level of confidence and belief in the reliability, truth and ability of people, equipment, or circumstances (to behave and perform in the manner expected or demanded). In relation to all spheres of aviation, we can define two separate strands of Trust. So, Trust is a necessary precondition for the achievement of operational goals and the creation and maintenance of an effective organisational culture.
