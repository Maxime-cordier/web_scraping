The following list is just a small example of “things” that pilots, air traffic controllers, engineers etc. need to trust: Aeronautical information (e.g. charts, AIP, approach charts, navigation databases etc.). Various software and related systems. Materials (e.g. engine fan blades, brake linings, fire suppressants etc.). International and National Regulations. Regulatory and safety oversight. Company procedures. Technical equipment (radars, human machine interfaces, aircraft hydraulic actuators etc.). Air traffic controllers providing the correct instructions. Pilots following instructions correctly. Ground and space-based navigation systems; also communication and surveillance systems (Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)). Instrument Landing Systems. Fellow Crew and Team members. The adequacy of the training they have previously received. etc.. The list is long, and most elements are intertwined with many others. In order for each element to deserve an increased level of trust from the professionals who use and rely on them, certain characteristics are desirable, such as: Accuracy. Reliability (under all operational and emergency conditions). Redundancy (back-ups are available). Self-correcting (integrated feedback systems). Error-detecting and alerting (e.g. Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA), Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS), and Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS)). Safety nets are provided (e.g. automatic shut-off valves, harnesses, and brake accumulators)..
