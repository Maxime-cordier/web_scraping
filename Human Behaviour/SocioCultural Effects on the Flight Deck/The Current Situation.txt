When we socialise with someone we are primarily concerned with how to appropriately communicate: “appropriate” varies between full-on, to none at all. We inevitably focus on elements of the other person’s personality and character that facilitate or hinder this; rather than our own! Culture can be described as the personality and character of a group of people, and it is clear that culture influences individual personality and behaviour as well. It is a common situation today that flight crews often consist of people with different cultural backgrounds, whether they share the same nationality, or not. Therefore, situations may arise where socio-cultural issues add to the complexity of interactions among crewmembers – both flight deck and cabin. A dynamic peculiar to medium and large airlines (due to size of workforce and fleets) is the fact that crews are temporary, and pilots and cabin crew rarely fly with the same crewmembers and combinations of crewmembers. This means that at the commencement of every task, crewmembers need to socialise (whilst working) with people who could be strangers to them. This socialising would take place on the level of personality and character within a shared organisational culture; however, flight crewmembers should attempt to understand how other, more general, cultures can affect these social interactions and especially how they relate to flight safety. Most safety critical tasks in aviation require coordination and cooperation with others, whether working as part of a team/crew, or using outside agencies for support. It is in the close face-to-face environment of the flight deck where effective teamwork is essential, that socio-cultural diversity can be most pronounced and visible, and therefore, where colleagues need to be able to “get on” with each other. This means, not only getting to know “the person”, but also getting to “know” their culture! Hold back the assumptions and stereotypes and show an interest.
