Frequent quality (balanced correctly between professional and social) communication is indicative that a crew is working well together. If cultural differences do exist, then quality communication is the only way to understand them and prevent misunderstanding. It is not so much cultural differences that hinder effective communication, but the social skills of the people involved. In the same way that our moods can affect the quality and frequency of our communication with others, so too can reticence over perceived cultural barriers or insensitivities towards cultural factors. Of course, reticence in asking questions, and openly admitting errors can themselves be specific cultural traits (see "General Cultural Differences" below). Hindrances to communication include: Whilst cultural differences may amplify each of these hindrances, these hindrances would still exist within a mono-culture; and they are only resolved through further communication. The first two hindrances shown above are often clearly obvious and we use our social communication skills to adapt. The last two hindrances, however, will not be clearly “visible” unless crewmembers habitually test understanding using their professional communication skills, i.e. as provided through CRM training. Different interpretations of events and aiming towards different goals may only become visible when a crewmember reacts, or behaves, in a way different to what we might expect. This may be much more likely to occur in situations where one or more crewmembers are stressed.
