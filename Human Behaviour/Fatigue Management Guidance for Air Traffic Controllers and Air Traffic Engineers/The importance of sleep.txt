Sleep is vital for your body to rest and repair as well as to give your brain a chance to ‘sort things out’ – it is thought sleep may be the time when the brain organises and stores information, replaces chemicals, and solves problems. A lack of good quality sleep will affect you. Most people require between 7 and 8 hours good quality sleep within each 24 hour period. Listed below are several straightforward tips for good sleep: Try to develop a regular sleeping pattern that fits in with your shifts.. Develop a regular pre-sleep routine.. Sleep in a quiet, dark place which isn’t too warm.. Avoid too much caffeine or alcohol before trying to sleep.. Avoid a heavy meal before trying to go to sleep.. It is easier to fall asleep if you are feeling relaxed – find relaxation techniques.. If you are struggling to fall asleep after about 30 minutes, try reading a book (but nothing too exciting!), having a milky drink or maybe taking a warm shower or bath to relax you.. If you suspect that you have a sleep problem or disorder, seek expert advice.
