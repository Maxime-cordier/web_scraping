It is very important to achieve a good balance between what you do in and out of work in order to minimise the risk of being fatigued when at work. Your job as an air traffic controller or engineer requires you to sleep enough to be fit to perform at an acceptable level of alertness when on duty. For this to happen you have to plan carefully around your shifts: Establish a routine outside work and try to stick to it. For example plan regular times when you will spend time with family and friends between shifts.. Plan for adequate periods when you will sleep.. Discuss the need to be fit for duty with your family.. Use a calendar to show family members what your shift patterns are so that they can work around these.. Eat properly, keep hydrated and maintain fitness.. On days off, consider the following: Try to stick to normal sleep patterns but if you feel particularly tired, go to bed.. Ensure any secondary employment does not interfere with your main job as a controller or engineer.. If you do something physically or mentally strenuous outside work, give yourself plenty of time to recover before starting work.. Try to take care with the intake of caffeine, alcohol and nicotine as these can disrupt sleep.. During extended periods away from work (e.g. annual holiday), you may get into ‘bad sleep habits’. Try to get back to normal a day or two before returning to work..
