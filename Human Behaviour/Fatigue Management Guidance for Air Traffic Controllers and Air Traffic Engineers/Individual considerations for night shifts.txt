Night shifts challenge your normal ‘body clock’ (internal circadian rhythms). Naturally, you will feel most sleepy in the early hours of the morning (03.00-05.00). Individual needs for sleep and rest will differ with age and with general health. It is good to be aware of this and do certain things to make night shifts easier, such as: Many people prepare by sleeping or resting before a night shift.. Eat a light meal a few hours before starting the night shift.. Maintain alertness during a night duty by keeping up a dialogue within the team.. If traffic and task demands are low, do not do things that are too distracting from monitoring the radar and radio (or system alarms if you are an engineer). Talking and reading usually help. Interactive games and videos may be too distracting.. If possible, move between tasks periodically during the night shift to help vary activities.. Organise regular breaks if available and use these effectively. If you are given enough time, and your unit allows it, take a short nap (no more than 30-40 minutes) but allow 15-20 minutes to wake up properly before returning to duty. (NB Sleeping or napping should only occur if these are agreed fatigue mitigation procedures at your unit).. If naps are not possible, try to get some fresh air and exposure to bright light during a break.. Operational staff will naturally feel tired at the end of a night shift. If you feel that this may affect your ability to drive home, you should consider sleeping before your journey home.
