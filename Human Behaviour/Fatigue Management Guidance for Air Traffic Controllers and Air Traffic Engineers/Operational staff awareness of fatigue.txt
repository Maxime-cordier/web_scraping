Quite often there may be early tell-tale signs of fatigue in air traffic controllers, for example: Missing pilot calls or readbacks, possibly having to ask pilots or colleagues to repeat information.. Forgetting routine tasks (such as strip marking or transferring an aircraft to the next sector).. Starting to fall behind in planning, maybe being caught out or surprised by something that you would normally anticipate in good time.. As fatigue becomes more obvious, the warning signs could be: Not seeing an aircraft when planning from the radar due to narrowed attention.. Confusing the steps of a plan, possibly having to change a plan.. Missing warning indications.. Impaired team working or leadership â€“ not communicating well with colleagues or taking longer to tell others what to do.. Finding it harder to concentrate on the ATC situation and being more easily distracted.. Irritability - pronounced irritability and moodiness very often triggered by routine tasks or any other trivial stimulus.. If you see these signs in yourself or colleagues, it is important to consider that fatigue may be the cause. Air traffic engineers are likely to see other tell-tale signs of fatigue in their own performance. Air traffic controllers and engineers need to recognise the signs and know how to respond in order to keep their performance acceptable and the operation safe.
