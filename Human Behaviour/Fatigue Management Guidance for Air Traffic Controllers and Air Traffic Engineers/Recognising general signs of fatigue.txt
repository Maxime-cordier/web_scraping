Controllers and engineers may experience only some of the signs shown in the table below and may not necessarily associate them with fatigue. There are also quite obvious outward indications such as yawning, eyes closing or changed breathing patterns. Fatigue can come on quite rapidly after a period of working, in which case the symptoms can be easier to detect. Alternatively it can build up gradually and the air traffic controller or engineer may not necessarily recognise that they have become fatigued.
