It is important to try to take periodic breaks from your main task as this will help you to stay alert and manage fatigue. Air traffic controllers can use breaks to do other non-operational tasks (such as training reports, logging information) and some of these may actually add to your fatigue. Ideally breaks should give you an opportunity to recover from the mental, visual and possibly physical demands of your main air traffic control task. Ensure that the final 10-15 minutes of your break is entirely restful and relaxing, avoiding work-related or computer-based activities, e.g. internet browsing, checking emails, etc.
