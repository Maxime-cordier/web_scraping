You need to be ready to work in the ATC environment. It is vital that you plan your time to allow time for recovery from any mental and/or physical tasks you have done before starting your shift. You must also plan for an appropriate amount of time to sleep properly before returning to work. Other things to consider include: Be particularly careful to get enough sleep on the night before you start your first duty after being off from work.. If you are worried that you may not wake up when you need to, use an alarm clock to take away this concern.. Allow enough time to brief yourself with any new information when you arrive at work..
