Historically, many different investigation agencies have identified deficiencies in standard operating procedures (SOPs) as a common contributing causal factor in aviation accidents and incidents. Some of the most cited deficiencies involving front line aviation personnel were identified as Non-compliance with established procedures;. Non-existence of established procedures. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has long recognised, through provisions in its standards and recommended parctices (SARPs), the importance of following SOPs for safe flight operations. For example, amendments to ICAO Annex 6, Operation of Aircraft, establish that each Member State should require that SOPs for each phase of flight be contained in the operations manual used by pilots. SOPs are usually laid down in different forms: Organisation Operations Manuals,. Aeroplane Flight Manuals. Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). Checklists. The SOPs enable the pilots and controllers to respond correctly in most types of normal, emergency or abnormal situation and are developed over a period of time after careful study of the situation, and are tested to ensure that they do not result in unintended and undesirable consequences.
