Effectiveness of self-detection of errors: SB errors: 75-95% detected, avg 86%. (More recoverable because you usually get feedback that the action didnâ€™t work but some lapse-type errors are resistant to detection). RB errors: 50-90% detected, avg 73% (Feedback is more problematic because the immediate response is that you got what you asked for.). KB errors: 50-80% detected, avg 70% (You may not have all of the relevant information available at the planning stage (e.g., attention bottleneck) or you can experience some Biases (e.g., overweighting vivid information)).. Including correction tells a different story: SB: ~70% of all errors detected and corrected. RB: ~50% detected and corrected. KB: ~25% detected and corrected. Contributing factors: Fatigue. Situation awareness. Workload. Training and experience/expertise. Familiarity. Memory in ATC.
