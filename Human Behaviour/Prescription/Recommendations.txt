Any medicine, treatment, drug, herbal remedy or traditional cure, that is likely to significantly interfere with the primary senses, perception, cognition, alertness, coordination, judgement, etc., should be prohibited for all safety-critical personnel. Any other medicine and treatment etc., which may interfere with the same should be supervised. This requires workers to self-report both illnesses and medication, including any self treatment and use of drugs. Employers need to strike a balance between protecting flight safety and promoting a reporting culture that encourages employees to admit to the medical problems they have, and to inform about the medicines they are taking. This requires continual and creative education and awareness-raising. Employers can achieve an effective balance by clearly defining their policy on health, medication, alcohol and other drugs. For such policies to be effective, the employer will need to provide suitable support (resources and procedures), to encourage self-reporting. Within any policy clear lines need to be defined between the consequences of unacceptable behaviour (e.g. concerning use of recreational drugs and alcohol at work) and how employees who self-medicate, but then “declare”, will be supported. Educational and awareness resources need to be directed at discouraging self-medication and the use of alcohol and other drugs, as well as the benefits of seeking immediate professional medical help for uncertain symptoms, and the need to adhere to programmes of prescribed medicine and treatment, under supervision.
