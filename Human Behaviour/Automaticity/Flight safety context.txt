While not a cognitive bias, automaticity refers to the fact that humans who perform tasks repeatedly will eventually learn to perform them automatically. While generally a positive attribute, this can lead to a person automatically performing a function (such as a checklist item) without actually being cognizant of the task itself. Expectation bias can lead them to assume that the item is correctly configured even if it is not. An interrupted routine process, such as pre-landing checks, may lead to both pilots on a commercial aircraft being unaware that the checks have been missed. In any situation where checklists are interrupted it is good practice to go back and start the checks again.
