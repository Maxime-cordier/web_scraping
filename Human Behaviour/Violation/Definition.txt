A Violation is an intentional action (or inaction) that results in noncompliance with known rules, policies, procedures or acceptable norms. Deliberate sabotage is in theory a violation, however, that is another subject, and this Article is concerned only with day-to-day cases of deviation from rules etc. Violations are classified within Human Factors as one category of an “unsafe act”; the other category contains all “errors”. The fundamental difference between errors and violations is that violations are deliberate, whereas errors are not. In other words, committing a violation is a conscious decision, whereas errors occur irrespective of one’s will to avoid them. It is possible that someone unaware of a procedure will violate it, clearly without knowing. One could say, then, that this was not a deliberate act, despite it being a violation. Such scenarios do occur and the root cause is usually found within organisational factors rather than human. James Reason[1] states that the boundaries between errors and violations are not hard and fast, and he describes “system double-binds” that make violations inevitable, no matter how well-intentioned the operator may be.
