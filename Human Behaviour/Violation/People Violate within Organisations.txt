There are many reasons why people violate, and each case can be considered as unique; however, patterns of behaviour do emerge. James Reason[1] describes two factors, in particular, that are important in facilitating habitual violations, namely: Violators are not all fallible to the path of least resistance, they may also be very motivated, and trying to do things “better” for the Company. This makes management pilots (for example) more likely to violate, especially in small companies. Often the conditions that induce violations are created, because the organisation cannot adapt fast enough to new circumstances. Processes, personnel, facilities, equipment, locations may all change, but unless procedures are adapted they may no longer be useful, putting pressure to work-around. Lack of leadership, finances, resources etc. can lead to workers making the most of what they have. Acceptance of a non-compliant way of doing the job may have become part of the local working culture.
