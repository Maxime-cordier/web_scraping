Ideally an organisation will have effective management systems whereby day-to-day operational data is collected and analysed and the results fed back into training, procedure design, management, resourcing etc. Within this data will be “evidence” of what violations are occurring, why, and in what context. Root causes can then be addressed at the organisational level. This does not mean carte blanche that dangerous and reckless behaviour should always be tolerated. If an effective Just Culture exists, backed up with policies and leadership, then workers will gladly take up their responsibilities knowing that they will be fairly protected whilst reckless colleagues will be addressed as is appropriate to each case. An effective strategy for managing violations will include the establishment and maintenance of a effective management systems that ensures, at a minimum, the following: Good leadership, planning, training, and resourcing.. Both management and employees are aware of their responsibilities and key risks related to their work and understand how violations reduce vital safety margins. *Channels are established to communicate difficulties and to discuss solutions. This facilitates learning about problems and adjusting planning accordingly to avoid strains, which could lead to violations.. Existing violations are analysed to fully understand their causes and any contributing human and organisational factors. Use of a standard taxonomy and descriptors for the different types of violation can help with understanding as well as directing mitigating measures.. A change management process is established such that pre-determined and unexpected changes are safety assessed to consider impact on human performance.. Employees are invited and encouraged to participate in setting boundaries and limits, as appropriate, of what is acceptable and unacceptable.. A defined and measurable programme for workplace culture improvement is undertaken, such that violations are not an acceptable option for employees.. Appropriate communication and feedback systems are used to ensure all the above happens, and employees really “feel it”..
