Whilst aptitude testing systems are not infallible in predicting the future performance of pilots, if they are developed and designed responsibly, they can offer valuable guidance to the operator. There is consensus amongst experts in the field that performance of pilots can be reasonably well predicted by means of aptitude testing and assessment.
