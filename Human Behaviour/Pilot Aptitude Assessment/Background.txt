Whilst flight crew training is one of the main drivers for operational safety, the quality of recruits entering the industry is a primary factor to the success of that training. In periods of strong growth, pilot supply comes under increased pressure. If the quality of new entrants in a given organisation declines, longer-term operational safety may be compromised and the task of training organisations becomes more challenging. It is, therefore, considered critical that every effort, and every available process, be used to ensure that the best qualified candidates are selected. To help its membership achieve that goal, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has developed and published a guide entitled Guidance Material and Best Practices for Pilot Aptitude Testing.
