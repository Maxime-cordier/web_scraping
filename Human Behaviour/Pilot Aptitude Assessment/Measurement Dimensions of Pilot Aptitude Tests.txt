Ab-initio cadets, for example, cannot be expected to have aviation-specific technical knowledge but they must possess a good foundation of academic qualifications. Captains will need to demonstrate professional aviation knowledge and should possess the social competencies required to practice good Threat and Error Management (TEM) and Crew Resource Management (CRM). First officers should be able to demonstrate the ability to adapt to new environments, challenges and policies.
