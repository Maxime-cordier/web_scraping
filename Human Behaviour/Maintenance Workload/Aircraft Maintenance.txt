The role of aircraft maintenance, simply put, is to ensure that aircraft presented “on the line” for flight operations comply with: all legal requirements (e.g. continuing airworthiness requirements, airworthiness directives (ADs), certificate of release to service, type certificate and supplementary type certificate),. operational equipage requirements (e.g. oxygen systems, first aid, and flotation devices), and. appropriate equipment for the type of operation being flown (e.g. communication, navigation and surveillance).. Furthermore, where maintenance is conducted under contract by a third-party maintenance and repair organisation, each airline customer may have other specific requirements (e.g. additional safety features, technical solutions, and issues such as in-flight entertainment and seating).
