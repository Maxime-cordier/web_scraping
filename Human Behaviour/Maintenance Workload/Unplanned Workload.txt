Other day-to-day tasks will arise on demand, in response to feedback from flight crews or observations made during routine maintenance inspections and line maintenance tasks. These tasks cannot be specifically planned for, but the workload involved can be roughly estimated. From experience this can demand as much as 50% of the planned effort i.e. manpower and time â€“ often given in units of FTE (full time equivalent). Situations can arise in response to commercial activities which will impact on the planned workload, such as the temporary leasing-in of an aircraft, or the need to switch aircraft types between operations (routes/tasks). These unplanned events can be for short intense periods, or have much longer and deeper repercussions. Finally, special unplanned maintenance activities are often required in response to Service Bulletins from manufacturers and ADs from regulatory and oversight authorities.
