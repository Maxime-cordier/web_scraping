It is essential that maintenance organisations implement a functional system for: comparing planned workload with available resources (human and otherwise),. managing human resources so that individual and team capacities (mental and physical skills, knowledge and attitudes) will be “as expected” and not severly deteriorated due to fatigue etc,. coordinating the availability of suitable and necessary facilities and equipment etc. predicting levels and type of unplanned workload, and. rapidly reacting to shortfalls when they occur.. This system needs to be underpinned by an effective performance feedback mechanism (reporting, meetings, briefings, training etc).
