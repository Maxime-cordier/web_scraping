by a pilot as individual digits; and therefore, a frequency change should not be combined with another instruction in order to enable the pilot to remember. The information in short-term memory is lost by two processes: Short term memory is found to be stronger with visual compared to audio information. Experiments show that it is more difficult to recall an acoustically similar collection of words. This acoustic similarity is a contributory factor in call sign confusion. The strategies for helping manage the limitations of short-term memory include: Long-Term Memory The size and the duration of information in long term memory are unlimited. The issue is retrieving the information which is needed and exactly when it is needed. From an information processing perspective there are three main stages in the formation and retrieval of memory: The information contained in long-term memory can be classified into two types:
