Attitude can be defined as a set of beliefs or a state of mind that has the potential to affect task performance; the effects can be positive, negative or neutral. This definition of attitude does not appear to differ much from that of mood, and there is a connection. Attitudes involve a habitual tendency to evaluate things in a certain way e.g. positive / negative or good / bad. Evaluations typically relate to one’s job, colleagues, a particular task, equipment and events. Evaluations about one’s own performance capabilities are also mood triggers that reinforce these self-assessments – people are generally optimistic or pessimistic (positive or negative). The biggest difference between mood and attitude, is that moods tend to fluctuate with high frequency, they are transitional, and reactive to events. Whereas, attitudes appear to be more permanent (low frequency) character traits and are accompanied by pre-set mood-behaviour patterns –e.g. I don’t like Fred, therefore I will not like working with him or I think recurrent training is a waste of time, therefore I won't revise. Moods can change quickly, but changing attitudes may require much training, education, determination and practice. Just as some moods can facilitate positive and effective workplace performance, the same is true of attitudes; although these positive attitudes tend to be described as the opposite to negative, or hazardous attitudes, such as: Anti-authority. Impulsiveness. Invulnerability. Machismo. Resignation. Complacency..
