Workplace Culture (safety and organisational) is a particular and all-pervading mood trigger, which because it seems to be permanent can contribute to moods such that they become habitual and lead to a change in attitudes. Naturally, this can be both positive and negative. A group of people (organisation, crew or team) can also be observed as having a prevailing mood, such that newcomers quickly adopt the same mood – i.e. moods can be contagious, whether it’s happiness or depression, recklessness or diligence. Maintaining one’s own integrity within a negative organisational culture requires: reliance on one’s core values (safety is always important to you, regardless of other pressures e.g. being liked by colleagues),. faith with one’s core beliefs (believing that you can always make a difference to safety),. maintaining a professional attitude (always respecting procedures), and. applying yourself to do things right, being cooperative and fully-focused; in essence, becoming a role-model[7]..
