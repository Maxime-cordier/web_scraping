Moods are temporary states of mind and/or feelings.. Moods are not permanent, although moods connected to fixed attitudes can appear that way.. Moods are detectable â€“ both instinctively, and, if we know what to look for, rationally.. Moods can lead to hazardous or helpful behaviour.. We can be in a certain mood (physically and mentally).. Things, events, people etc. can put us in a particular mood (mood triggers, of which we may not be conscious).. Mood triggers include stress, illness and medication.. We can change our own mood in the short-term by changing our posture, actions and facial expressions, and in the long-term by adopting an appropriate healthy lifestyle and diet.. Alcohol and other drugs predominantly have a negative affect on mood.. We can create, or set a mood i.e. we can improve the mood of others, directly impacting organisational, crew and team, performance, communication and cooperation..
