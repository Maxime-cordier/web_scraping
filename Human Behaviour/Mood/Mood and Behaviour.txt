A key point for aviation safety is the fact that as someoneâ€™s mood changes so does their behaviour i.e. how they engage with work tasks, how they communicate with colleagues, their self-motivation, vigilance and alertness, and how well they perform. A self-aware worker may notice these changes in themselves, and situationally aware colleagues may notice these changes in others. Knowledge and awareness of personal and organisational (general) mood triggers can also allow workers to prepare and better control their behavioural responses. The connection between mood and behaviour also raises the observation that some moods facilitate positive and effective work performance, whilst others hinder. It would seem that there are many more moods that could hinder than help.
