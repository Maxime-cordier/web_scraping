Cognitive biases are convenient intellectual shortcuts that allow us to streamline our decision making processes (heuristics) and have evolved to help humans process information quickly when under pressure. These biases are founded on values, memory (experience, beliefs and training), socialisation and personal attributes and, as such, can result in illogical and irrational decisions, and misjudgement of risks and threats.
