Barriers to reporting must be addressed before a reporting system can have a substantial impact on operational safety. The barriers to error reporting fall primarily into the following categories: Generally, the voluntary reporting systems, being non-punitive, provide more useful information about errors and their causes than mandatory reporting systems. A major reason is that voluntary systems provide frontline personnel with the opportunity to tell the complete story without fear of punishment. The depth of information contained in these stories is vital to understanding the error. Staff who are forced to report errors are less likely to provide in depth information because their primary motivations are self protection and adherence to a requirement, not to help others avoid the same error. Voluntary systems also encourage practitioners to report hazardous situations and errors that did not cause harm but have the potential to do so. Both mandatory and voluntary error reporting systems will prove futile in the absence of a strong, well designed system for analysis and response. When appropriate, the error reporting must result in effective, timely system changes that are visible, communicated and which are also upheld by accrediting bodies and national aviation authorities through standards that enhance aviation safety.
