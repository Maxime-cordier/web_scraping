Voluntary error reporting facilitates the collection of information on actual or potential safety deficiencies thus contributing to the identification and implementation of safety improvement measures. It is a proactive process and should include related arrangements for collecting information about safety concerns, issues and hazards which otherwise will not be revealed by a mandatory reporting system. The principles of the successful voluntary reporting systems are described in detail in the Voluntary Occurrence Reporting article. Mandatory reporting systems imply that the individual at fault must report the error. However, analysis of serious errors almost always reveals multiple system failures and often the involvement of many individuals. The requirements for mandatory reporting is discussed in detail in the Mandatory Occurrence Reporting article.
