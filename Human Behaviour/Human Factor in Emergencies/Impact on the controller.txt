Although controllers do not have the sense of personal danger the flight crew is exposed to, they are also subject to stress when an emergency situation happens. The most common issues are: Controllers feel the urge to “do something”. This sometimes makes them perform unnecessary actions.. Higher workload – the emergency usually happens without warning and the controller needs to come up with a new (and sound) plan almost immediately.. “Tunnel vision” (i.e. too much focus on certain details while overall perception is degraded) can easily occur when under stress.. Time distortion – controllers’ perception is that too much time has elapsed between communications.. Memory is degraded under stress. Critical details can easily be forgotten leading to an even higher workload or the transmission of wrong information..
