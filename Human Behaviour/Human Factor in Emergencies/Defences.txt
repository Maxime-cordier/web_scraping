There is not much to be done about the higher workload that usually arises in an emergency situation. The procedures to be followed are usually standardised and optimised in terms of requirement compliance and ease of use. The psychological issues on the other hand offer opportunities for improvement since all individuals have different reaction to emergency and stress. The advice in this section is derived from best practices and common sense and is not to be considered exhaustive nor is intended to supersede local procedures. Both the aircraft crews and the controllers undertake regular training to handle emergencies and practise the actions that may have to be taken in such an event. These recurring exercises enable personnel to build confidence and knowledge of the basic and predictable steps necessary to handle the emergency events to be carried out consistently. It will trigger the appropriate learned reaction and skills devoted to coping with the unanticipated or unique aspects of the situation.
