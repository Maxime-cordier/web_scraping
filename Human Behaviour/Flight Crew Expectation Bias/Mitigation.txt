The FAA Safety Team said that pilots need to understand that expectation bias often affects the verbal transmission of information. When issued instructions by air traffic control, pilots should “focus on listening and repeat to yourself exactly what is said in your head — and then apply that information actively. Does the clearance make sense? If something doesn’t make sense (incorrect call sign, runway assignment, altitude, etc.), then query the controller about it.” NTSB, in its final report on an incident in which an Air Canada Airbus A320 mistakenly lined up with an occupied taxiway on approach to San Francisco International Airport in night VMC (A320 / B789 / A343, San Francisco CA USA, 2017) said expectation bias occurs automatically and can be difficult to overcome once established because of its inherent strength. One way to overcome expectation bias is through training that stresses active questioning of observations and recognizing the presence of conflicting cues. In addition to active questioning to overcome expectation bias, which may be prone to human limitations such as fatigue impairment, cockpit systems to improve crew positional awareness could provide a conspicuous cue of a misalignment with an intended landing surface. “The NTSB concludes that flight safety would be enhanced if airplanes landing at primary airports within Class B and Class C airspace were equipped with a cockpit system that provided flight crews with positional awareness information that is independent of, and dissimilar from, the current ILS backup capability for navigating to a runway.”
