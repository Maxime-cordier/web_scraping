Everything that passes through the senses is not necessarily “perceived”. We tend to perceive things that: On the contrary we tend to perceive fewer things that do not interest us, are not making a large impact, and do not induce fear. Also, we do not always perceive accurately the things that we focus on and think about. This occurs in two distinct ways: As humans, we are all susceptible to the misperceptions caused by limitations in our senses, and we will generally experience the misperceptions in an identical manner. However, as individuals, with different experiences and personalities, the results and impact of our subjectivity will differ – sometimes quite markedly. In both cases other factors can influence our susceptibility to misperception, such as: illness, stress, fatigue, medication (and other drugs), concentration, motivation, etc.
