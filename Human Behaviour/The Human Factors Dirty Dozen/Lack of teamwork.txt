In aviation many tasks and operations are team affairs; no single person (or organisation) can be responsible for the safe outcomes of all tasks. However, if someone is not contributing to the team effort, this can lead to unsafe outcomes. This means that workers must rely on colleagues and other outside agencies, as well as give others their support. Teamwork consists of many skills that each team member will need to prove their competence. Some of the key teamwork skills include: leadership, followership, effective communication, trust building, motivation of self and others, and praise giving. To create an effective team it is necessary that the following issues, as appropriate, are discussed, clarified, agreed, and understood by all team members: A clearly defined and maintained aim, or goal(s). Each team member’s roles and responsibilities. Communication messages and methods. Limitations and boundaries. Emergency procedures. Individual expectations and concerns. What defines a successful outcome. Debriefing arrangements. Team dismissal arrangements. Opportunities for questions and clarification. A team’s effectiveness can also be improved through the selection of team members to reflect a broad range of experience and skill sets, and also through practice and rehearsal.
