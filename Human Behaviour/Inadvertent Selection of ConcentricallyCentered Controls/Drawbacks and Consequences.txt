A drawback to the concentrical design is that settings/selections can be inadvertently changed. For example, rotating the navigation course selection knob resulted in an unintentional change to the barometric altitude setting. A few examples of common causes of unintentional selections include: Mechanical interference between two concentrically-centered knobs;. Pilot accidentally rotating two knobs at once as a result of finger positioning errors and/or finger slippage;. Pilot inadvertently selecting the wrong knob and subsequently fails to make appropriate corrections or fails to detect the inadvertent selection.. Reports from manufacturers and from pilots indicate that these incidents are occurring with some regularity. Examples of the possible consequences of inadvertent selection of concentrically centered controls include: Loss of communication (due to the selection of an improper frequency). Level bust (due to the selection of improper pressure setting).
