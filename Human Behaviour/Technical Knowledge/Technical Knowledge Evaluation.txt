Typically, training for engineers, pilots and air traffic controllers is provided in technical subjects to provide a broad grounding prior to skills training. Syllabi vary depending on type of licence and qualification, as well as the State in which the application is made. Below are some examples of technical subjects for which knowledge is expected; the lists are not exhaustive. Airline Transport Pilot’s Licence (ATPL) Aircraft airframes, electrics, engines. Principles of flight. Flight Rules and Air Law. Navigation (e.g. Navigation by Radio Aids). Communication and Communication Systems. Flight Performance and Planning. Meteorology. Human Factors (performance limitations). Air Traffic Controller Licence Aviation law. Air traffic management. Meteorology. Communication, navigation and surveillance. Aircraft and principles of flight. Human Factors. ATC equipment and systems. Safety Management Systems and safety culture. Linguistic knowledge, including radio-telephony phraseology.. Engineers and Technicians The specific technical knowledge required by aircraft engineers and technicians depends on the licence aimed for, or held, e.g. engine type, certifying responsibilities, and level A or B. Usually these also cover a broad-range of “general” subjects at the basic introduction level e.g. maths, physics, electronics etc.
