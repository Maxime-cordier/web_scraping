Attaining technical knowledge through training, and maintaining technical knowledge through continued awareness, further training and development, are essential elements in the competent conduct of any task, job or role. Attaining and maintaining technical knowledge also goes hand-in-hand with gaining and maintaining skills (physical, mental and interpersonal), and procedural knowledge. Each of these elements is facilitated by (framed by) experience, which provides relevant contextual knowledge (or understanding). Within aviation, engineers, pilots, air traffic controllers, and cabin crew, have their technical knowledge routinely evaluated. On the one hand, technical knowledge is evaluated by exam (written and oral) to achieve qualifications and licences, and, on the other hand, technical knowledge is observed in practice when it is applied during simulated or real operations e.g. Line Oriented Flight Training. Inappropriate practical application of knowledge, or inadequate technical knowledge, during operations can introduce error.
