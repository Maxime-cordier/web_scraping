It is difficult to define levels of technical knowledge application by operators whilst on-the-job. Tasks are conducted and completed by the application of skills, and often these skills are directed by standard procedures. Where “additional” technical knowledge is required, it must be correctly recalled and interpreted within the context of the given situation. This is vital when creating situational understanding of circumstances for which neither skills nor procedures have been learnt and/or practiced. This refers to novel situations and Rasmussen’s Skill-Rule-Knowledge Framework[1] When a novel situation (or combination of events) is encountered, and no procedure exists, the operator is required to recall similar events and apply technical knowledge in order to fully evaluate the situation and make a decision for action. Their competence at achieving a successful outcome can depend on the degree of technical knowledge learnt and recalled, available relevant skills and breadth of experience.
