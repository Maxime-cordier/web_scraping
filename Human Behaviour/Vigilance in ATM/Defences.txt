Vigilance is not a skill; you cannot learn to be vigilant. Vigilance is a result of a number of circumstances over which the individual does not always have sufficient influence. It is also very difficult for the individual to detect changes in their vigilance. Even when feeling tired, we tend not to link that directly with a loss of vigilance. We easily overrate our capacity. Often, reduced vigilance is revealed by unwanted outcomes of decisions and actions. That is why it is very important that colleagues keep an eye on each other. It is usually easier for somebody else to notice when things start to deteriorate then it is for us. We can, however, take a number of measures that will help us to remain vigilant for a longer period of time. By making sure we are physically fit, well rested, well trained and informed, we enhance our capacity to stay vigilant longer.
