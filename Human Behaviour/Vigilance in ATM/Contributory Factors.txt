Reasons for reduced vigilance include the following: When the workload is very high, the ATCO’s attention is stretched and they are more likely to miss things. A similar situation can exist when the workload is very low, for example, during a quiet night shift. As a general rule, ATCO performance rises to a peak when the workload is high, but falls off if it becomes too high. After a take over, the controller will start feeling confident after approximately 15 minutes. This can easily lead to a loss in vigilance and hence the chances of perception errors rise. Complacency is a much disputed term. It is sometimes argued that complacency can manifest itself as lack of vigilance; in particular, the ATCO may not crosscheck the situation sufficiently and may allow his mental picture to deteriorate so that an unsafe situation develops unnoticed. Such a situation can occur if automation is very good, because overconfidence in the system leads to complacency and lack of adequate vigilance. Distraction or interruption is one of the most cited reasons for incidents. Some of the reasons for distraction or interruption can be due to non-essential conversation or extraneous noise (e.g. a radio or TV playing) and can severely impair a ATCO’s vigilance. Fatigue affects vigilance in an insidious way. The ATCO may miss a potentially unsafe situation developing; for example, they may fail to notice an error made by a pilot or by themselves (e.g. an incorrect readback).
