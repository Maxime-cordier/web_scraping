In commercial air transportation, the role of the cabin crew or flight attendants is to ensure the safety and comfort of passengers. Cabin crew workload consists of considerable walking, bending over, heavy lifting and pushing, and dealing with a variety of stressful and sometimes physically dangerous situations in the passenger cabin. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) defines a flight attendant serving in Part 121 (air carrier) operations as “an individual, other than a flightcrew member, who is assigned by a certificate holder to duty in an aircraft during flight time and whose duties include activities related to ensuring cabin safety.”
