Air traffic control is a highly demanding job which requires high levels of responsibility with inherent stress due to its nature and the complexity of tasks involved. Just like the flight crews who work in an intensive, stressful environment, air traffic controllers are considered the aviation professionals who face very high levels of stress. Air traffic control in its nature entails a complex set of tasks demanding levels of knowledge and expertise, as well as the practical application of specific skills pertaining to: The air traffic controller must constantly reorganise and adapt his or her system of processing information (often done under time deficit) by changing operating methods (in particular, cognitive processes, conversation, coordinating with other controllers, assistants, anticipation and solving problems) as they arise and interact with each other. This is carried out by means of the precise and effective application of rules and procedures that need to be quickly selected and applied according to differing circumstances. It is evident that the job entails, on the whole, high psychological demands while being subjected to a considerable degree of external control.
