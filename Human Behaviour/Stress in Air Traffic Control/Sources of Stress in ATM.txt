The most common sources of stress reported by air traffic controllers are connected with both operational aspects and internal organisational structures. Sources of stress related to the operational aspects (list not intended to be comprehensive): Peaks of traffic load. Time deficit. Operational procedures (often limited and need to be adapted). Limitation and reliability of equipment. Abnormal/Emergency Situations. Sources of stress related to organisational aspects (not comprehensive): Shift schedules (night work in particular). Management. Role conflicts. Unfavourable working conditions. These stress factors, related to both aspects, can affect the job satisfaction and the general health of air traffic controllers. In fact, as the workload increases the air traffic controller tends to employ more procedures which are less time-consuming, together with a progressive reduction to the minimum of flight information and the relaxation of certain self-imposed qualitative criteria. It is evident that the number of decisions to be made becomes a stressful condition when the controller’s decision-making capacity is stretched to the maximum; this can lead, in case of overload, to a very risky situation often addressed as a “loss of the picture”. In addition, it is frequently reported that, many errors often occur during periods of light and non-complex traffic. This point highlights the need of extra effort required to regulate the psycho-physical reactions, maintaining a high level of arousal and vigilance even in conditions of “light traffic load”.
