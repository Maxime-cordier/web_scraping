The equilibrium of physical and mental factors does not completely destroy the stress factor, but it will make it manageable. Stress can be avoided by managing the following physical and psychological factors: Maintain good physical fitness. Have regular meals. Have sufficient sleep. Sound time management. Control the physical environment. Sound preparation with regard to knowledge, skills and procedures. Building confidence in own training and ability. Leading balanced social and family life (so that financial and domestic worries are not a problem). Share and discuss problems so as not to bottle them up. Solve problems as soon as possible to prevent “the domino” effect. Other recommendations involve development or maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, with adequate rest and exercise, a healthy diet, limited consumption of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products.
