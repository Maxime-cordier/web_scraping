The factors that facilitate a person to perform at an optimal level are variable and peculiar to the individual, however, certain elements are often common, such as: workload. task complexity and difficulty. task familiarity and past experience. circadian rhythm (i.e. previous rest/duty cycles and the time of day or night). degree of associated risk if failure occurs. personal, and crew, motivation. the working environment. levels of personal stress. health. interpersonal relationships at work (cooperation and coordination). Organisations, teams and individuals can take positive actions to facilitate optimum performance, such as: moderating and adapting the working environment. pre-planning and briefing to share workload. cross-monitoring and checking procedures. fatigue risk management systems. employee well-being programme (including stress management). cultivating a professional safety culture.
