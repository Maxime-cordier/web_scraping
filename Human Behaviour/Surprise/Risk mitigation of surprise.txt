In aviation surprise is not uncommon and can be mitigated through training, procedures, crew resource management (CRM) and experience. Exposure to unexpected events in training will reduce the risk of a non-standard response. Pilots can be taught to respond to surprises rationally, focusing on safe flight (aviate, navigate, communicate), assessing what has happened or not happened and coming up with a plan.. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide guidance to deal with many unexpected situations, reducing cognitive load on the pilots.. CRM: Teaching pilots to distinguish the difference between a (rare) startle response from (more common) surprise can help an unaffected pilot recognise when a colleague has been affected and is unknowingly responding in a way that is leading to an unsafe condition requiring intervention. The importance of the Pilot Monitoring (PM) having the confidence to act without delay, if necessary, cannot be overstated.. Airmanship: With experience, pilots are less likely to be surprised. Greater situational awareness that comes from managed cognitive load, professional knowledge and experience means that certain events are not wholly unexpected. For example, encountering clear air turbulence in the vicinity of a jet stream or encountering birds on final approach to a coastal airport..
