Many definitions of human factors exist, tuned for specific audiences with the same phrases echoing among diverse industries. For example, Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) website says, “The study of human factors is about understanding human behavior and performance. When applied to aviation operations, human factors knowledge is used to optimize the fit between people and the systems in which they work in order to improve safety and performance.” The Australian Transport Safety Bureau's (ATSB’s) website and its 2006 human factors training material add, “The term human factors has its origins in aviation, and while the term was used informally in literature and British Royal Air Force accident investigation reports in the 1940s, it was not until 1957 that it was first formally used to describe the modern practice (Edwards, 1988).” Another definition — from a California State University Long Beach program in human factors psychology — goes beyond the aviation industry: “Human factors (also known as ergonomics or human engineering) is a scientific discipline which examines human behavior and capabilities in order to find the best ways to design products, equipment and systems for maximum safe, effective, satisfying use by humans. “Human factors faculty in our department are currently working on research including: - Basic human performance — perception (auditory and visual); - Cognition (action-selection, memory, decision making); - Workload; - Skill acquisition and knowledge engineering; - Human-computer interaction — web design, multimodal interfaces, and usability testing; and, - Aviation psychology — workload, situation awareness, and interface design for air traffic management.” The presentation by Sandia’s Wenner said that goal of human factors in engineering design/analysis are that the result “ensures that the system is ‘adapted’ to the human, rather than forcing the human to adapt to the system; allows the human to perform in the best manner of which he/she is capable, rather than hindering performance; ensures that the human is not subjected to extreme physical or mental stress or workload; [and,] provides personal satisfaction for the user. … Humans are the most complex system component, the least understood system component and the system component most vulnerable to failure.”
