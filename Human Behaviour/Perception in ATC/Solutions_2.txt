TRM practices.. Always report error in perception using your local Confidential Reporting system. Unless they are made aware of a problem, it is probable that others will make the same mistake. By reporting through the Confidential Reporting System, you can be sure that the problem will be examined and lessons learned will be passed on to other ATCOs within your unit and in other units with similar tasks..
