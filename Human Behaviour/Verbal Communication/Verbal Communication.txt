Verbal communication is the use of words and vocal noises to give and receive information. It can be considered as any communication where a message is given verbally and received audibly, regardless of any coding, decoding and transmission medium used in between. It can be face-to-face (e.g. caterer to cabin crew), remote (e.g. air-ground radio), or somewhere in between (e.g. ramp worker using the radio and also hand signals to a pilot), or even two pilots (or controllers) sitting side-by-side but both concentrating on instruments. Verbal communication can be enhanced with supporting non-verbal communication such as body language, deliberate signals (hands, lights, signs), and written communication (e.g. anti-icing code). Likewise it can also become ambiguous and confusing with inappropriate use of non-verbal communication.
