A basic airport with just a short taxiway connecting the ramp with the middle of the runway will require ATC to arrange for backtracking of the runway by most of the arriving and departing traffic. The presence of taxiways parallel to the runway with several joining taxiways greatly reduces the need for backtrack and facilitate expeditious operations. Landing aircraft may vacate the runway at a convenient point while the pilots focus on optimal deceleration rather than on trying to use a specific taxiway. Runway vacation normally happens before the last taxiway therefore enabling aircraft departing in the opposite direction to use the full length without the need to backtrack. For the purpose of expediting air traffic, aircraft may be permitted to taxi on the runway-in-use, provided no delay or risk to other aircraft will result. The use of backtrack is an example of this procedure. It allows more than one aircraft to be on the same runway (without compromising safety), hence the benefit to efficiency.
