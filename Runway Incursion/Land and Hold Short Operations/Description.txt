LAHSO is a procedure used mainly in the USA. If it is to be used by ATC in the USA, the FAA requires that the runways involved have: Pilots receiving and accepting ATC LAHSO instructions in the form "Clear to land Runway 'AA', Hold Short of Runway 'BB'," must either exit Runway 'AA', or stop at the holding position prior to runway 'BB'. Under FAA rules, ATC may authorise LAHSO on a dry runway only if the following conditions are also met: Related FAA rules require that if the runway is wet, ATC may only authorise LAHSO if the following additional conditions are also met: Under FAA procedures, pilots are not required to accept a LAHSO clearance but if they do, the pilot-in-commands are expected to satisfy themselves that their aircraft can safely land and stop within the Available Landing Distance, which ATC will provide upon request. If landing long becomes likely, then a go around or rejected landing is expected rather than the possibility of violating a LAHSO clearance. It should be noted that some non-US airlines specifically prohibit the acceptance of LAHSO on safety grounds based upon their operational risk assessment procedures.
