Automated tools and systems do not require controllerâ€™s input to operate. Most of these systems (FAROS, RWSL, RAAS, EVS) are targeted at the flight crew and provide additional layers of protection against hazardous landings. Surveillance systems (e.g. A-SMGCS), on the other hand provide the controller with means to enhance their situational awareness, especially: In poor visibility conditions;. If parts of the manoeuvring area are not visible from the tower due to obstructions;. When an unknown aircraft that has not checked in on the frequency approaches the runway threshold (e.g. entering the CTR from uncontrolled airspace).. Also, surveillance systems can be very helpful in mitigating human error, e.g.: Aircraft not communicating with the tower due to various reasons, e.g.: Crew transferred from approach to tower too early; Crew tuning a wrong frequency; Crew tuning the correct frequency but not checking in.. Crew transferred from approach to tower too early;. Crew tuning a wrong frequency;. Crew tuning the correct frequency but not checking in.. Aircraft approaching the wrong runway due to loss of positional orientation;. The controller forgetting about an aircraft on final..
