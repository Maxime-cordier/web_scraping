At aerodromes where Category II & III operations take place or where ground movement requirements are complex, a taxiway guidance system may be installed in order to regulate traffic. The system operates by selective switching of the taxiway centerline lighting so that individual sections or routes, each terminating at a lighted stop bar, are illuminated in order to show the way ahead. The taxiing guidance system consists of: stop bars and. selectable segments of green taxiway centerline lights.. The system is designed to provide pilots with visual guidance while taxiing during night operations and during periods of low visibility. Stop bar lighting is prescribed in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 14 for low visibility operations and is in use at many international airports. Stop bars are considered a valuable defence against aircraft and vehicles accidentally entering a runway without ATC clearance and a solid barrier against the pilotsâ€™ error related to poor situational awareness.
