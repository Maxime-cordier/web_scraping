After the aircraft has descended below the decision altitude (or minimum descend altitude) and the flight crew has decided to land, there are two major subsets of following actions, neither of which can be considered safe enough: The flight crew may go ahead with the landing, causing a runway incursion.. The flight crew (having just discovered the lack of a landing clearance) may opt to abort the landing (even after touchdown) and start a go-around. This course of action may worsen the situation, resulting in e.g. a tail strike or loss of separation event with another aircraft in the aerodrome traffic circuit.. In either case, loss of control due to the startle factor, hesitation or over-compensation is possible. This, in turn, may lead to a runway excursion or even a CFIT event.
