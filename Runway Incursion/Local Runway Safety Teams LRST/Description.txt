An aerodrome Local Runway Safety Team (LRST) is a key element in an aerodrome runway safety programme. LRSTs should ensure that a strong focus is maintained on runway safety across all parties creating, de facto, an aerodrome level safety management function. At some aerodromes cross-disciplinary teams may already exist that could carry out the functions of the LRST, each using a discrete runway safety agenda. If such teams are employed, it is essential that their work is not duplicated; instead the work should be integrated as part of the aerodromeâ€™s runway safety action plan.
