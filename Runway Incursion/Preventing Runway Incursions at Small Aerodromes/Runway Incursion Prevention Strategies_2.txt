as the instructions of pilots and aerodrome staff. To help protect the people the aerodrome owner/manager should: Ensure the aerodrome boundary is secure, and access is controlled.. Consider signage at the boundary of a licensed aerodrome clearly indicating there is no access without permission. Signage may quote a relevant regulation to discourage trespassers.. Where there is access, in particular a public rights of way, provide signage that clearly warns of the dangers such as approaching aircraft which may be difficult to see if there is any ground slope, obstacles, or (nearly) silent aircraft practising glide approaches. Signage should also indicate from where aircraft will be approaching and advise that some pilots may have reduced vision and steering ability whilst conducting taxy operations.. In cases of public right of way, additionally consider providing a clearly signed alternative route.. Clearly define areas where dogs are required to be kept on leads. Under certain legal circumstances and with permissions, stiles can be used to restrict animal access.. Remind pilots that their passengers should be escorted and supervised at all times whilst on the aerodrome. This may be published in the local flying orders, noted in the AIPs or presented on aerodrome signage.. Ensure the security of the aerodrome boundary and the associated signage is inspected regularly..
