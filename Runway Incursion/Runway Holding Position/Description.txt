An aircraft between the holding position and the runway is considered to be on the runway as far as ATC operations are concerned. This means that: Examples of departing and arriving aircraft in relation to the holding position: (1) is at the holding position, (2) has passed the holding position, (3) is about to vacate and (4) has vacated the runway. Aircraft (2) and (3) are considered to be occupying the runway, i.e. that no other aircraft will receive a take off or a landing clearance at this moment. More than one holding position may be defined for a taxiway/runway crossing. The most common reason for this is the presence of a CAT II/III ILS. If the ILS signals can be affected by reflection from an aircraft near the runway then another holding position is defined that is further away from the runway. Example of different holding positions - AB13, AB12, AB11 and A10W are CAT I holding positions while A13, A12 and A11 are CAT II/III holding positions. Note: COBRA, DINGO, RABIT, SNAPA, C2 and D2 are intermediate holding positions and not runway holding positions.
