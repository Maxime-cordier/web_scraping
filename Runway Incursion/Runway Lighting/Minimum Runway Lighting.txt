Runway Edge Lights are omni-directional and are located along or just beyond the edges of the area declared for use as the runway as defined by edge markings and are white subject to certain specific exceptions. The area defined may not necessarily be the maximum width of the paved runway surface. The lights may be either elevated or embedded in the surface. If a landing threshold is displaced, but the pre-landing threshold area is available for take off, then the edge lights between the beginning of the runway surface and the displaced threshold will be split so as to show red up to the landing threshold whilst still showing white after that point. If a runway ‘starter extension’ is provided which is narrower than its associated runway, then blue edge lighting may be used to mark its edges.. Runway Threshold Lights are provided in a line along the landing threshold at the touchdown end of a runway and define the beginning of the declared Landing Distances. They are green and can only be seen from the approach.. Runway End Lights are provided in a line along the end of the runway available for use. They are red and can only be seen in the direction of runway use..
