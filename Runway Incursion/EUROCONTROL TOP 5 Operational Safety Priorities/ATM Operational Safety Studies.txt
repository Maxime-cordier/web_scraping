The operational safety studies are targeted risk studies and surveys carried out to support the analysis of the Network Manager Top 5 operational risks. Every operational safety study focuses on a particular issue and examines in detail the incident scenarios and associated safety risk, available or potential prevention barriers and their effectiveness. All operational safety studies carried out over the years can be viewed here: Landing without ATC clearance. Detection of manoeuvring area conflicts by air traffic controllers. High energy runway conflicts. Airside vehicle drivers impact on runway safety. Aerodrome hot spot identification on aerodrome charts. Risk of operation without transponder or with a dysfunctional one. Impact on ATC from a loss of aircraft transponder function - safety considerations. Blind spot â€“ inefficient detection of conflict with aircraft in close proximity. Detection of conflicts at the interface to adjacent ATC sectors.
