The process supports aviation service providers (ANSPs, Aircraft Operators and Airport Operators) in their proactive risk management. It is a cyclic process and includes the following steps: collection of accident and serious incident (severity A and B) data reported to and investigated by the service providers;. data coding and analysis by means of a comprehensive set of barrier models â€“ Safety Functions Maps (SAFMAPs);. conduct of targeted in-depth risk analysis and surveys on specific topics;. identification and prioritisation of the ATM operational risks;. monitoring, analysis and update of the risk priorities, as appropriate.. The collaborative process for identification of operational safety hazards is run by the EUROCONTROL Operational Safety Group (SAFOPS) and supervised by the EUROCONTROL Safety Team and the Network Management Board.
