The seminar agenda addressed the new safety recommendations applicable to the major airport risk stakeholder groups and the available implementation guidance provided in the Action plan and elsewhere. Good practices and signs of excellence that could support the implementation of the safety recommendations and improve safety of aerodrome operations were the core of the seminar presentations and discussions. Over 100 representatives from European aircraft operators, ANSPs, airport operators, regulators, and international organisations attended the seminar.
