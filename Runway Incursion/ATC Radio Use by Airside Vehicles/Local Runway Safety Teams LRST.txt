There will often be a Local Runway Safety Teams (LRST) at an airport. If there is, it will usually be run by the Airport Authority and attended by ATC. It exists to monitor issues which may affect runway safety and is therefore very concerned with runway crossings by vehicles and situational awareness of their drivers, both of which are heavily dependent upon high standards of radio communication. It is there both to receive input and to help co-ordinate any action which may be needed to deal with problems and issue alerts.
