It is important that radio communications are concise so that the amount of transmission time is minimised, but also even more important that they are fully understood. In many cases, single words are used which are equivalent to a phrase. Sometimes, even single words which are not commonly encountered in everyday use are used by ATC as important instructions. Also, where letters or numbers have to be spoken individually eg “Hold at C12” then it is important that the international radio telephony alphabet is used.
