The minimum spacing between two aircraft in the event of a deviation is calculated using techniques similar to those used for independent parallel approaches. Two factors apply: since the radar separation is applied diagonally, less distance between runways means a greater in-trail distance between the aircraft; and. less distance between runways also means that the deviating aircraft crosses the adjacent approach track more quickly..
