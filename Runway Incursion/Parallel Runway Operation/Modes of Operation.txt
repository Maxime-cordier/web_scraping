In ATC terms, the various modes of operation available for the use of parallel or near-parallel instrument runways are distinguished as: It should be noted that when the spacing between two parallel runways is lower than the specified value determined by wake turbulence considerations, the runways are considered as a single runway with regard to vortex wake separation. In the case of segregated parallel approaches and departures there may be semi-mixed modes of operations. At least one runway is used for both take offs and landings.
