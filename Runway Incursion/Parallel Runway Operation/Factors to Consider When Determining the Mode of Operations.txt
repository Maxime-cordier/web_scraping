Theoretical studies and practical examples indicate that maximum aerodrome capacities can be achieved by using parallel runways in a mixed mode of operation. In many cases, however, other factors such as the land-side/air-side infrastructure, the mix of aircraft types, and environmental considerations result in a lower achievable capacity. Other factors such as non-availability of landing aids on one of the parallel runways or restricted runway lengths may preclude the conducting of mixed operations at a particular aerodrome. Because of these constraints, maximum runway capacity may, in some cases, only be achieved by adopting a fully segregated mode of operation, i.e. one runway is used exclusively for landings while the other is used exclusively for departures. The advantages to be gained from segregated parallel operations as compared to mixed parallel operations are as follows: a) separate monitoring controllers are not required; b) no interaction between arriving and departing aircraft on the same runway and a possible reduction in the number of missed approaches; c) a less complex ATC environment overall for both radar approach controllers and aerodrome controllers; and d) a reduced possibility of pilot error following undetected selection of the wrong ILS.
