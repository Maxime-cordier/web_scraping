Integrated Tower Working Position (ITWP) is an enhancement of the surveillance system. It combines surveillance data with controller input (clearances issued). All general advantages of surveillance systems.. Allows the creation of tools that provide early warning for manoeuvring area conflicts.. Checks ATC clearances for creating conflicts well in advance.. Complicated implementation. The introduction of ITWP requires a lot of research, effort, resources and time. Usually not feasible for smaller aerodromes.. Increased workload. The input of all issued clearances into the system requires time and effort. This leads to either increased workload, reduced capacity or increased number of controllers necessary.. Complex. Requires extensive training to operate properly. Also, as with any software system, the more complex the application is, the greater the chance of errors and software bugs.. Dependent on many data sources. The ITWP requires successful integration of different types of data in order to work efficiently. Weak points (e.g. vehicles or aircraft without transponders, issues with surveillance systems, etc.) have the potential of greatly reducing the effectiveness of ITWP.. Limited protection against runway incursion. ITWP does not have flight crew intentions input, therefore runway incursion discovery is generally limited to the capabilities already present in A-SMGCS level 2. The system will warn the controller only after the incursion has occurred.. A dedicated study has shown that ITWP has the potential to prevent most conflicts on the manoeuvring area.
