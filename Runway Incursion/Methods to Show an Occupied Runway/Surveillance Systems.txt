Surveillance systems use surveillance (usually radar) data to present the controller with a situational picture. A-SMGCS covers applications and systems for the air traffic controller, vehicle drivers and the aircraft pilots. Operationally available systems offer: The most common level of implementation of A-SMGCS across Europe is a Surface Movement Radar together with a Mode S multi-lateration system and a runway incursion alerting system in the air traffic control tower. A-SMGCS technologies can help to prevent runway incursions and conflicts between aircraft and vehicles on the manoeuvring area.
