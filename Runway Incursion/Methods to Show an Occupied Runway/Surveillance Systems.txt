Surveillance systems use surveillance (usually radar) data to present the controller with a situational picture. Provide reliable data, especially in low visibility conditions or obscured areas.. Present the actual traffic situation and provide opportunity to check if a clearance is being correctly followed.. Do not require controller input to operate, therefore they do not increase controller workload (a controller may choose not to use them and only use procedural control).. Some versions (e.g. A-SMGCS level 2) provide safety alerts, similar to STCA in area control.. No alerts for conflicting clearances since there is no controller or pilot intentions input.. Equipment dependent, e.g. the system may be less effective if some vehicles or aircraft are not equipped or are not using their transponders.. A-SMGCS covers applications and systems for the air traffic controller, vehicle drivers and the aircraft pilots. Operationally available systems offer: Controller surveillance display;. Runway incursion alerts for the controller;. Selective switching of taxiway lights, stop and hold bars;. Routing guidance functions;. Runway protected areas penetration alerts and runway occupied alerts for the vehicle driver.. The most common level of implementation of A-SMGCS across Europe is a Surface Movement Radar together with a Mode S multi-lateration system and a runway incursion alerting system in the air traffic control tower. A-SMGCS technologies can help to prevent runway incursions and conflicts between aircraft and vehicles on the manoeuvring area. Surface Movement Radar. Provides basic surveillance data.. Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems (A-SMGCS) level 1. Provides correlated data for aircraft and vehicles using transponders.. Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems (A-SMGCS) level 2. Provides enhancements to A-SMGCS level 1 by adding e.g. runway incursion alerts..
