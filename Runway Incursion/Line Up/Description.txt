Line up is a part of the ground movement of an aircraft that normally connects the taxiing phase and the take off roll. It starts when an aircraft moves past the holding point of a taxiway and ends when the aircraft gets aligned with the runway centreline. Essentially, lining up means that the aircraft enters a runway. Once the nose has passed the holding point, the runway is to be considered occupied regardless of the fact that the aircraft may still be on the taxiway. On controlled aerodromes, pilots need to obtain an explicit clearance before entering a runway, either for crossing purposes or with the intent to take off. An active runway is associated with the inherent risk of fast moving aircraft with limited manoeuvrability. Therefore, special care has been taken during procedure design and strict adherence is required by both pilots and air traffic controllers. A line up clearance is not a take-off clearance. On no occasion should a clearance be passed when the pilot is engaged in line up or take-off manoeuvres. Aircraft shall not be permitted to line up and hold on the approach end of a runway-in-use whenever another aircraft is effecting a landing, until the landing aircraft has passed the point of intended holding..
