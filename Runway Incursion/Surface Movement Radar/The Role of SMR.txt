In the permanent absence of visual observation of all or part of the manoeuvring area or to supplement (or in poor visibility, replace) visual observation, SMR may be utilised to: enhance the controllers' situational awareness regarding the manoeuvring area;. monitor the movement of aircraft and vehicles on the manoeuvring area;. provide routing information to pilots and vehicle drivers as necessary; and. provide advice and assistance for the safe and efficient movement of aircraft and vehicles on the manoeuvring area.. In order to operationally use SMR the tower controllers need to obtain an additional endorsement GMS (ground movement surveillance) to their ADI rating.
