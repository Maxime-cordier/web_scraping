The following barriers, when deployed and employed correctly, are capable of alerting ATC in time to prevent runway incursions and ground conflicts and/or to prevent a ground collision in case of runway incursion or a ground safety event. ATCO memory aids for issued (not issued) clearances. ATCO direct visual detection. ATCO visual detection using remote camera displays. ATCO detection and/or resolution following pilot/driver report. ATCO detection (e.g. of occupied runway) by use of basic Surface Movement Radar. A-SMGCS level 1 providing identification of both aircraft and transponder-equipped vehicles. A-SMGCS level 2 providing conflict alerts in addition to A-SMGCS level 1 data. ITWP display of both traffic situation and controller input (ATC clearances), and alerting. ATCO detection after alert from airport ground systems. Use of discrete names for holding positions and pilot reports e.g. reporting point REKRA instead of P2. A procedure stating that all vehicles entering a runway should display high visibility flashing/strobing lights on in all visibility conditions. Further information on the prevention and mitigation barriers, and their effectiveness in real life events, is provided in the Controller Detection of Manoeuvring Area Conflicts â€“ Safety Barriers article.
