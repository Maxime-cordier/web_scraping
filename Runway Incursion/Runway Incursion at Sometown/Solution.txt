The recommendation was clear: Change the traffic concept to secure a clear interface between the two towers. The implementation plan was well prepared. It included a commitment from management and gained the acceptance of Sometown Airport. The ATC Tower cap was rebuilt for the introduction of a new ground position and the controllers were trained in handling the new concept. The new ground position would handle the traffic, typically taxiing from crossing runway 18/36 and east of the runway, e.g. for departure runway 09L or 27L, after landing runway 09R or 27R until they had crossed runway 18/36 (fig. 2). Figure 2 Prior to implementation of the new concept, a promotional tour was conducted. This included Aircraft Operators meetings, the distribution of 4000 flyers and special visits to the four major local operators.
