There are a number of factors that need to be considered when issuing a conditional clearance. While not safety hazards on their own, these factors can easily contribute to a runway incursion if neglected: Aerodrome layout – e.g. taxiways crossing the runway at acute angles might prevent the flight crew from seeing the conflicting traffic;. Premature acceptance – when the flight crew acknowledges a conditional clearance before identifying the conflicting aircraft;. Aircraft painting mismatching the aircraft callsign – e.g. if an operator is doing a flight on behalf of another operator;. Low sun angles may prevent the departing aircraft from correctly identifying (or even spotting) the conflicting aircraft;. More than one aircraft on final (e.g. one aircraft is about to land and there is another aircraft 5NM from touchdown)..
