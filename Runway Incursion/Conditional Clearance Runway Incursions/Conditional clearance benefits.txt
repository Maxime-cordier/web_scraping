If properly used, conditional clearances can help speed up the flow of air traffic. This is especially true when the frequency occupancy time is at peak e.g. the controller has to issue several clearances at the “same” time. Normally this would cause delays to all aircraft except for the first. The situation can be avoided by using a conditional clearance, i.e.: Thus, the use of conditional clearances can help the controller maintain an expeditious traffic flow. As always, the controller is supposed to monitor the situation and to intervene in case the instructions are not complied with (e.g. in case of misunderstanding or delay of action by the flight crew) but this is achievable.
