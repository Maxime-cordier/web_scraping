The ARIWS is designed to be complementary to normal ATS functions, providing warnings to flight crews and vehicle operators when a conflict has been unintentionally created or missed during normal aerodrome operations. For example, the ARIWS will provide a direct warning to the crew when the controller has provided a clearance to hold short of a runway but the flight crew or vehicle operator has “missed” the hold short portion of their clearance and tower has also issued a takeoff or landing clearance to that same runway. In the case where a clearance has been issued and a crew reports aborting or a non-compliance due to “red lights”, then it is imperative that the controller assess the situation and provide additional instructions as necessary. It is possible that the system has generated a false warning or that the potential incursion no longer exists. However, it may also be a valid warning! While false warnings are known to be possible, in no case should the illumination of the ARIWS be dismissed without confirmation that there is no conflict. If the system has malfunctioned, it should be disabled and alternate procedures put in place until repairs are effected. It must be stressed that under no circumstances should pilots or operators be instructed simply to “cross the red lights”.
