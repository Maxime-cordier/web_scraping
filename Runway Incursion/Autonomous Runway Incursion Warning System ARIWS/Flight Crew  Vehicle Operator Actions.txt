It is critical that flight crews and vehicle operators understand the warning being transmitted by the ARIWS system!! Should the ARIWS activate, pilots are presented with a globally consistent signal which means STOP IMMEDIATELY and must react accordingly. Warnings are provided directly to the flight crew in near real-time as the associated urgency means that there is no time for “relay” type communications. Pilots receiving an ATS clearance to takeoff or to cross a runway, and seeing the red light array, must: STOP!. advise ATS that they aborted/stopped because of the red lights. await further ATS instruction. It must be stressed that the extinguishing of the red lights does not, in itself, indicate a clearance to proceed based on the previous ATS instruction to takeoff or to enter the runway. A new clearance is required from air traffic control. The absence of red warning lights only means that potential conflicts have not been detected but continuing without a new clearance may well be the cause of a new conflict.
