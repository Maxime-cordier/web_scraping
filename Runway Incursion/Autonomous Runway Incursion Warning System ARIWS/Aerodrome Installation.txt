An ARIWS is not necessary at all aerodromes, on all runways or at all possible runway entrances. An aerodrome considering the installation of a ARIWS should make an independent assessment of its needs considering traffic levels, aerodrome geometry, ground taxi patterns, and other pertinent factors. There are, however, some basic system requirements that are applicable to all ARIWS installations: the control system and power supply for the system must be independent of any other system in use at the aerodrome, especially other parts of the aerodrome lighting system. the system must operate independently from ATS communications. the system must generate a globally accepted visual signal that is instantly understood by crews. local procedures should be developed to account for potential system failure.
