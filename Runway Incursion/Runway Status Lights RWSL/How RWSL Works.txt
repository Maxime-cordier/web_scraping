The system determines the locations of aircraft and vehicles on the airfield, as well as of departing and arriving aircraft using data from three surveillance sources: Integrating the data from these diverse sources has been achieved so as to support a high level of reliability and accuracy. Redundancy features allow the system to generate aircraft or vehicle tracks from single or multiple surveillance sources in case of malfunction or nonexistence of sensors or equipment. This covers the presence of many airside vehicles without transponders which respond to multi-lateration interrogation. The integrated surveillance data is used to determine the operational status of a track including whether an aircraft object is stationary, taxiing, landing, or taking off and predicts its likely future behaviour. On the basis of this, and in accordance with pre programmed thresholds, the system determines which lights should be turned on and when and triggers activation and updates a visual display in the TWR. TWR supervisors are able to modify some RWSL settings such as light intensity and runway configuration.
