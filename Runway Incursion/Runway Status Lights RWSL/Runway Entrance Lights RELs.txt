RELs are installed at taxiway/runway intersections to provide an indication when it is unsafe to enter the runway. They are installed parallel to the taxiway centreline (which may or may nor be lit) at a distance of 2 feet from it and to one side. The first light in the pattern is installed 2 feet prior to the runway holding point marking. They continue to a penultimate light pair at 2 feet before the runway edge marking with the last light then sited 2 feet before the runway centreline lights.
