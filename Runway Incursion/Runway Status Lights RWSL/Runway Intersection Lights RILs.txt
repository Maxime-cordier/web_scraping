RILs are the third component of the RWSL system and were first installed for operational evaluation at Boston in 2010. They are used where one runway intersects another and provide an indication to pilots and vehicle drivers that there is high speed traffic on the intersecting runway and that it is unsafe for to enter or cross. They consist of red unidirectional lights installed in a double longitudinal row aligned with and offset to either side of the runway centreline lighting in the same manner as and using the same light fixtures as THLs.
