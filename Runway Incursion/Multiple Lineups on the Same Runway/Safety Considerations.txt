Multiple line-up procedure can be considered safe if implemented in compliance with ICAO provisions and following a safety assessment that will help identify appropriate risk mitigation measures. Two types of mitigation strategies have been identified by the "Safety Assessment of Airside Capacity Enhancement" carried out by EURCONTROL (see Further Reading): Main Current Mitigations EAPPRI â€“ restriction on use of oblique angled taxiways.. Compliance with ICAO published phraseology and other conditions (ICAO Doc 7030, Part 3, Section 3.1 Conditions for application).. Flight progress strip management to show occupied runway and sequence (not universally used).. Provision of training and assessment for Pilots regarding Aerodrome signage, markings and lighting.. Additional Potential Local Mitigations Implementation of A-SMGCS Level 2.. Restrictions during hours of darkness (UK and others).. Local safety assessment including looking at combination of conditional clearances and multiple line-ups and setting visibility criteria.. Constraints on immediate take-offs..
