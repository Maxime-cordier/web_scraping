Multiple line-ups is a technique employed at some busy airports to expedite the departure of aircraft from the runway. It concerns departing aircraft being instructed to line-up on the same runway at different positions using different access taxiways. Multiple line-up is a significant capacity enabler when implemented in line with the ICAO recommendations and phraseology.
