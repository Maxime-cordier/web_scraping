Multiple line-ups, intersection departures and conditional clearances may increase runway throughput. An advanced ATC tool for optimizing runway throughput thus increasing runway and airport capacity is the DMAN (Departure Manager) developed by EUROCONTROL and included in the SESAR Concept of Operations. DMAN is implemented at some aerodromes (such as Frankfurt) and tested and validated for other major European aerodromes.
