(The interface between people and the environment) The liveware - environment interface refers to those interactions which may be out of the direct control of humans, namely the physical environment - temperature, weather, etc., but within which aircraft operate. Much of the human factor development in this area has been concerned with designing ways in which people or equipment can be protected, developing protective systems for lights, noise, and radiation. The appropriate matching of the liveware - environmental interactions involve a wide array of disparate disciplines, from environmental studies, physiology, psychology through to physics and engineering.
