This article introduces core concepts of human performance modelling (HPM) in the field of aviation human factors research. Today’s HPM software tool sets derive from academic research conducted in the 1990s — and earlier military research — in the fields of experimental psychology and engineering. By the mid-2000s, HPM results were stimulating collaborations among diverse types of safety specialists. SKYbrary editors reviewed two HPM-related books to compile this overview — Human Performance Modeling in Aviation and Integrated Models of Cognitive Systems — cited in References. In Human Performance Modeling in Aviation, David C. Foyle and Becky L. Hooey described the potential for aviation safety breakthroughs to be enabled by integrating software tool sets. They said, for example, “HPM can suggest the nature of likely pilot errors, as well as highlight precursor conditions to error such as high levels of memory demand, mounting time pressure and workload, attentional tunneling or distraction, and deteriorating situation awareness. “Fast-time modeling permits the generation of very large sample sizes from which low-rate-of-occurrence events are more likely to be revealed. An additional advantage associated with the use of human performance modeling includes the ability to propose and evaluate [flight deck/air traffic control] display and procedural changes. This is especially useful in that these evaluations of proposed changes can be done early in the design cycle, without the need to fabricate expensive prototype hardware. Finally, the careful characterisation and formal thinking of the assumptions and processes involved in the problem can, by themselves, lead the modeler to gain new insights into system development and usage.”
