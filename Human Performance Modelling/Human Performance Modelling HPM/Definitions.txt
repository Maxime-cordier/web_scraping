Single-focus models of cognitive functions — These models study discrete human factors such as control of eye movements, visual attention, categorization, decision-making or memory. “Such single-focus models are necessary but not sufficient for understanding human cognition,” according to Wayne D. Gray (see References). “Although single-focused models are not usually created to be part of a larger, more integrated system, if cast in the right form, they can play strong roles in building integrated models of cognitive systems.”. Human performance modelling (HPM) — In contrast to single-focus models, HPM has demonstrated since the mid-2000s the ability to “model the complex environment of aviation, including multiple operators, vehicle dynamics, environmental cues and constraints, and both nominal and off-nominal operations,” according to Human Performance Modeling in Aviation..
