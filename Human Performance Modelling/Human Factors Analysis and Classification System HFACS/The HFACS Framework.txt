The HFACS framework (Figure 1) describes human error at each of four levels of failure: Within each level of HFACS, causal categories were developed that identify the active and latent failures that occur. In theory, at least one failure will occur at each level leading to an adverse event. If at any time leading up to the adverse event, one of the failures is corrected, the adverse event will be prevented. Figure 1: The HFACS framework
