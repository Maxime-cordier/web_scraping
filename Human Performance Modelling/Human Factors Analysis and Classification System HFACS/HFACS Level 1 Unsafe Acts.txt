The Unsafe Acts level is divided into two categories - errors and violations - and these two categories are then divided into subcategories. Errors are unintentional behaviors, while violations are a willful disregard of the rules and regulations. Errors Skill-Based Errors: Errors which occur in the operatorâ€™s execution of a routine, highly practiced task relating to procedure, training or proficiency and result in an unsafe situation (e.g., fail to prioritise attention, checklist error, negative habit).. Decision Errors: Errors which occur when the behaviors or actions of the operators proceed as intended yet the chosen plan proves inadequate to achieve the desired end-state and results in an unsafe situation (e.g, exceeded ability, rule-based error, inappropriate procedure).. Perceptual Errors: Errors which occur when an operator's sensory input is degraded and a decision is made based upon faulty information.. Violations Routine Violations: Violations which are a habitual action on the part of the operator and are tolerated by the governing authority.. Exceptional Violations: Violations which are an isolated departure from authority, neither typical of the individual nor condoned by management..
