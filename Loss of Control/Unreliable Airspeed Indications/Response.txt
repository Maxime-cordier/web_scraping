Keep the aircraft away from the low-speed and high-speed ends of the flight envelope Disconnect the Autothrust, Autopilot, and Flight Director;. Revert to safe default parameters for pitch attitude and thrust setting;. Every effort should be made to remain in VMC.. In the event of unreliable airspeed indications, a crew should fly the approximate pitch and power normally expected at that stage of flight until it is discovered which (if any) system is indicating correctly or the problem is resolved. Aircraft manufacturers issue appropriate guidance for specific aircraft types including pitch and power settings to fly at different stages of flight if airspeed information is not available. Information in either the Flight Manual or manufacturerâ€™s abnormal procedures is comfortingly accurate. With intelligent crew co-operation it is possible to fly surprisingly accurate speeds using the published data. If in doubt, or until more accurate information is available, maintaining a slight nose up attitude and climb power should keep the aircraft safe.
