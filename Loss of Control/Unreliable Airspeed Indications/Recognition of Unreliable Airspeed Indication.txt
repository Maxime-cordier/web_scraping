Abnormally large Mach number or IAS fluctuations, and differences between the indications at each pilot position, or between target and actual speed, may suggest an unreliable airspeed condition. However, all indications may be consistent but equally unreliable if the problem is affecting all pitot-static systems – although it is normal for modern aircraft to be certificated with a standby pitot head of different design to the two main heads . Note also that a difference between target and indicated speed could also be the result of the aircraft being heavier/lighter than planned or as a result of something which is causing unusual drag, such as incorrect configuration for the phase of flight. Flight crew awareness of typical speed/pitch/thrust/fuel flow/climb or descent rate characteristics for the stage of flight is the most effective way of detecting unreliable airspeed indications e.g.: Pilots may only become aware of the problem when the aircraft has adopted an unusual pitch attitude, making the recovery and further control of the situation much more challenging, especially if the aircraft has entered a stall. Recognition of the problem relies on a pilot having a good understanding of the pitch attitudes and power setting expected for level flight at various speeds/ configurations in normal circumstances. For recognition of a gross error this needn’t be much more accurate than, for example; low speed 7deg nose up, medium speed 5 degrees nose up high speed 3 degrees nose up. It is interesting to note that pilots flying highly automated aircraft, who are accustomed to using information such as Flight Path Vector (FPV), are frequently unable to describe these reference figures with any accuracy. Autopilot, auto thrust, and flight directors can all contribute to loss of control in the event of unreliable speed. For example, the autothrust system may erroneously sense an overspeed and command a thrust reduction and if the speed is actually much lower, than sensed, a stall could result.
