Stall warning systems are designed to identify an impending stall at the incipient stage so pilot intervention can occur in time to prevent the full aerodynamic stall of the aircraft. However, pilot overload due to an emergency or an unreliable speed situation, the failure of stall warning equipment or an aircraft upset can all mask the effectiveness of the warning systems and a fully developed stall may occur without pilot awareness. Generic indicators of an aerodynamic stall can include: Activation of artificial stall warnings. Aircraft buffet. Reduced flight control authority, especially reduced or loss of roll control. Significant aft control column displacement. High rate of descent. A nose down pitching tendency at the point the stall occurs. However, not all aircraft react in the same manner and the visual and tactile cues found in many aircraft may be absent in others. As examples: Not all aircraft have an audio stall warning. Not all aircraft experience significant buffet during a stall. In some Fly-By-Wire aircraft, such as the Airbus A320, there is no aft flight deck control (side stick) displacement. Some swept wing aircraft experience a nose up pitching tendency at stall onset vice the nose down pitching moment associated with a "conventional" stall. For these reasons, it is critical that pilots thoroughly understand the stall characteristic of their aircraft type as well as the aircraft stall warning, prevention and/or recovery systems inclusive of their limitations, and the possible ramifications of any potential system failures (e.g. failure modes).
