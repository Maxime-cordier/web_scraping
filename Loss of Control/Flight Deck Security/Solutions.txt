The Germanwings flight 4U9525 accident indicated the need to ensure that 2 members of the operating crew are present on the flight deck at all times during operations. Such an SOP implies that pilots and cabin crew liaise more closely and brief more extensively on the need for and timing of pilot physiological breaks and other situations necessitating exit from the flight deck. Operators will need to consider the protocols for access to and presence on the flight deck. Longer term, design change could also ensure that all operating flight crew should be secured on the flight-deck before the passenger boarding doors are closed prior to departure and remain secured on the flight-deck until after the passenger doors are opened at the destination. This would prevent any unlawful entry from the cabin and minimise any unlawful seizure by a single flight crew member. To enable this, existing aircraft could be modified and new aircraft designed with all required crew facilities forward of the secure flight-deck door. On short/medium haul aircraft this would require a toilet, safe food & water storage and a reclining crew rest seat. Additionally on aircraft used for long range operations where in-flight relief is required provision of bunk/s. This is not a new concept, many long range aircraft already have toilet and crew rest facilities forward of the secure flight-deck door.
