Communication. A locked flight deck door reduces the situational awareness of the flight crew in respect of conditions in the passenger cabin in the event of an on-board security issue. Also, the situational awareness of the cabin crew is reduced in respect of conditions on the flight deck in the event of an emergency.. Crew Incapacitation. In the case of total incapacitation of flight deck occupants, cabin crew may not be aware and may not always have a means of accessing the flight deck to assist.. CRM. The locking of the flight deck door reduces routine interaction between the flight crew and the cabin crew during the flight. This emphasises the importance of the aircraft commander using pre flight preparation and turnround time to confirm any exceptional preparations for effective CRM beyond those routinely prescribed.. Physiological Need. Naturally, the need for flight crew to use toilets, access designated crew rest facilities or be supplied with food and drink, requires access through the flight deck door during flight. Procedures for door opening mean that egress and access will take longer with the result that the flight deck crew are not always able to go to the toilet at a time of their exact choice, which may cause them to be distracted and, exceptionally, might exacerbate an existing underlying medical issue in a way that would not otherwise have occurred.. Unlawful Interference. While the purpose of the flight deck doors is to prevent unauthorised access to the flight deck, there is an attendant risk that one of the pilots may themselves unlawfully interfere with the flight for example to commit suicide. Consequently procedures should be in place to ensure that at least two operating crewmembers, including at least one qualified pilot at the controls, are in the Flight Crew compartment at all times..
