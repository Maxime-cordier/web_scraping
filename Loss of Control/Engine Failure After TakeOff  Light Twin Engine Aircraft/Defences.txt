Obviously, if aircraft engines were absolutely reliable, engine failure during takeoff would never occur. Manufacturers have made great improvements over the years in the reliability of their products and turbine engines have demonstrated much better reliability than piston engines. However, as any engine is a mechanical device, it is unlikely that the potential for engine failure will ever be completely eliminated. Pilots can reduce the risk of failure by ensuring that the engines are maintained to the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations, that during their preflight inspection all fluids are adequate and that there are no obvious leaks or damage, that the fuel supply is free from water or other contamination and, during the run-up, that the engine performs within the published limits. Even with all preflight recommendations met, there is still a potential for a failure during takeoff and initial climb. The other critical defence, therefore, is a thorough understanding of the aerodynamics of a failure and the appropriate actions that must be taken should it occur.
