Vmcg - Minimum control speed on the ground - the minimum airspeed at which the aircraft is directionally controllable during acceleration along the runway with one engine inoperative, takeoff power on the operative engine(s), and with nose wheel steering (if installed) assumed inoperative. Vmca - Airborne minimum control speed - this is the minimum airspeed at which directional control can be maintained under the following conditions: maximum gross weight, center of gravity [C of G] at the maximum aft position, sea level, flaps set to the takeoff position, landing gear retracted, operating engine developing maximum power, critical engine failed and windmilling, a maximum of 5 degrees of bank towards the good engine. Vyse - Best rate of climb speed with a single operating engine in a light, twin-engine aircraft - the speed that provides the most altitude gain per unit of time following an engine failure.
