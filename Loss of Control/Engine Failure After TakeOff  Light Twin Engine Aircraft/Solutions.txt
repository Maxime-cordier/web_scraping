SKYbrary does not advocate simulating the loss of an engine during the takeoff roll or during initial climb as a means to enhance pilot proficiency. The inherent risks of doing so far outweigh the benefits of the exercise. There is considerable benefit, however, in periodically seeking the services of a qualified instructor for refresher training in asymmetric flight. A pilot should also thoroughly understand the aerodynamic issues which surround asymmetric flight and know, without hesitation, the actions that must be taken in the event of a failure. He should develop generic memory drills for engine failures on takeoff and mentally review them before every departureâ€¦ "In the event of an engine failure prior to lift off, I will close both throttles, maintain the center line with rudder and bring the aircraft to a stop using full brakes" "In the event of an engine failure immediately after takeoff, I will counter the yaw with rudder and use aileron to raise the dead engine. I will raise the undercarriage and lower the nose to maintain airspeed. I will then positively identify the failure and feather the failed engine..." Engine Failure After Take Off With this sort of review, the pilot has mentally prepared themselves for a failure and is in the best possible position to successfully deal with that eventuality.
