Whilst any definition of what is non-standard must be made by reference to what is standard for any particular operator, a number of generalised cases can be identified: Any flight that deviates from laid down Rules and Regulations.. Positioning or ferry flights (both fully and conditionally released to service). Pleasure, sightseeing or other ‘air experience’ flights. Display or ‘exhibition’ flying for the benefit of persons on the ground. Air-to-air photography. Airworthiness function or check flights after maintenance input or in association with aircraft acceptance or hand back. Flights to develop operator-specific visual approach/departure procedures. Flights undertaken specifically and solely for crew training or familiarisation purposes. An exceptional freight-only flight made by an operator which does not normally undertake such flights. Airworthiness certification flights (unless flown by trained test pilots following their main occupation). Formation flying where it is not part of Standard Operating Procedures..
