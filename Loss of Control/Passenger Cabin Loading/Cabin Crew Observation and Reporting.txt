Senior cabin crew can assist operational safety by using their discretion to report what they perceive to be abnormal seated passenger distribution prior to take-off, especially if free seating is available. This is a particularly important point in the case of flights which make an en route or ‘transit’ stop, at which passengers either leave or join the flight, and where some through passengers remain on board. This scenario has often led in the past to ground staff preparing an incorrect load and trim sheet based on unchecked (and undisclosed) assumptions about passenger seat occupancy when an aircraft will be departing with only a part load. Either the seats occupied by passengers remaining on board at the transit stop are not established, or the seats chosen by the boarding passengers are not known, or both. Random assumptions are then made for load and trim sheet purposes, which may not reflect the actual longitudinal trim of the aircraft as actually loaded. This may result in a take off with the aircraft trim outside the envelope for permitted safe flight, or the pitch trim setting made by the flight crew may be incorrect to a degree which then affects normal aircraft control at and after the initiation of rotation.
