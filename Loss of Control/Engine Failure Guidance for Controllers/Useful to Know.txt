As the nature of the engine failures is very diverse, this article is not envisioned to address all of them. The flight crew SOPs for single engine failure of multi-engine aircraft is very different from an engine failure of single engine aircraft. It is critical if the engine failure is contained or uncontained. The uncontained engine failure poses a greater risk since ejected debris from the engine could create hazard to the occupants and the structure of the aircraft and hence the risk of engine fire increases. Other risk scenarios associated with engine failure can range from an in-flight inadvertent thrust reverser deployment to an engine(s) flame-out due to the ingestion of volcanic ash. The following technical problems could be precursors to engine malfunction and subsequent failure, and the crew might elect to shut down the problematic engine if there is: Another critical element to consider is the phase of flight in which the engine failure occurs. Depending on the phase of flight, the engine failure might result in:
