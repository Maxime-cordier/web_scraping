A wide range of practical problems could arise in the cockpit following an engine failure associated with: Heavy workload in the cockpit - the crew must assess the situation and the workload might become intense. Announcing the problem - the crew will communicate the problem to ATC. Emergency communication protocols (MAYDAY or PAN PAN) should be used but non-standard phraseology (“We’ve lost No.2”, “Engine No.2 is gone/dead”, “We’ve got no thrust/power in No.2” etc.) often occurs.. Seeking information and deciding on course of action - the crew will need any information available regarding adjacent aerodromes and weather conditions if the they elect to proceed to and land at the nearest suitable aerodrome. Seeking optimal glide - in case of engine failure on single engine aircraft or multiple engine failure on multi-engine aircraft, the crew will seek the best glide ratio in order to attempt restart of the engine(s) and/or to reach next suitable aerodrome/airfield or place suitable for emergency landing..
