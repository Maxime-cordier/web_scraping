Best practice embedded in the ASSIST principle could be followed (A - Acknowledge; S - Separate, S - Silence; I - Inform, S - Support, T - Time): A - acknowledge the problem (the declared malfunction and emergency if applicable), ask for the crews’ intentions when the situation permits. S - separate the aircraft from other traffic and allow room to maneuver. S - silence the non-urgent calls (as required) and use separate frequency where possible. I - inform the adjacent ATC units if the aircraft is approaching or it is near their areas of responsibility; inform your supervisor and relay the flight crew’s intentions. S- support the flight with any information requested and deemed necessary. Provide information and details about the next suitable aerodrome(s). If necessary inform the crew of the minimum safe altitude. T - provide time for the crew to assess the situation, don’t press with non urgent matters. The controller should be prepared to: Inform the crew about next suitable aerodrome and provide alternate aerodrome details and weather information as soon as possible. Inform landing aerodrome of the inbound traffic with engine failure. Clear RWY according to local instructions. Keep safety strip clear. Offer to the flight crew to fly an extended final approach. Make sure go-around does not happen due to ATC reasons. Ensure that towing equipment is on stand-by as appropriate. Record last known position and time in case of forced landing.
