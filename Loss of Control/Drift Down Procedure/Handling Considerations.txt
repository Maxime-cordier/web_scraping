After an engine failure or shutdown the principal handling requirement is to counteract any thrust asymmetry using rudder and trim as required to maintain the aircraft in balance. In some aircraft this will enable the auto-flight system to remain engaged and maintain control of the aircraft without reaching the limits of its control authority. The other priority is to ensure that Max Continuous thrust is applied, either by the AT system or manually. In some aircraft the auto-flight & Auto Thrust system will manage this very well if the correct selections are made on the FMC. Once those two things have been achieved, things generally happen quite slowly enabling some time to be given to consideration of the required descent profile and FMS/ FMGS selections to be made. Pilots can refer to their operations manuals where Drift Down performance is tabulated; by comparing aircraft weight at the time of engine failure with temperature deviation from ISA, the crew can obtain their OEI service ceiling and speed regime. They can also determine time, distance and fuel burn from cruise altitude to their MEA/MORA/safe altitude.
