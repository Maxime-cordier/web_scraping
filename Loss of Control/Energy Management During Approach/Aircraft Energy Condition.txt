Aircraft energy condition is a function of the following primary flight parameters: Airspeed and airspeed trend;. Altitude (or vertical speed or flight path angle);. Drag (caused by speed brakes, slats/flaps and landing gear); and,. Thrust.. One of the primary tasks of the flight crew is to control and to monitor aircraft energy condition (using all available references) to: Maintain the appropriate energy condition for the flight phase (i.e., configuration, flight path, airspeed and thrust); or,. Recover the aircraft from a low-energy condition or a high-energy condition.. Controlling aircraft energy involves balancing airspeed, thrust (and drag) and flight path. Autopilot modes, flight director modes, auto throttle modes, aircraft instruments, warnings and protections are designed to relieve or assist in this task so it is essential that flight crews have a thorough understanding of these modes, their potential and limitations.
