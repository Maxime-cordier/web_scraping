Aircraft energy condition is a function of the following primary flight parameters: One of the primary tasks of the flight crew is to control and to monitor aircraft energy condition (using all available references) to: Controlling aircraft energy involves balancing airspeed, thrust (and drag) and flight path. Autopilot modes, flight director modes, auto throttle modes, aircraft instruments, warnings and protections are designed to relieve or assist in this task so it is essential that flight crews have a thorough understanding of these modes, their potential and limitations.
