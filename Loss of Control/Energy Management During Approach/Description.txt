The flight crew’s inability to assess or to manage the aircraft’s energy condition during approach is often cited as a cause of unstabilised approaches. Crews should appreciate that fatigue will increase the likelihood that they will have difficulty in detecting that an approach is going outside normal parameters. Either a deficit of energy (low and/or slow) or an excess of energy (high/fast) may result in an approach-and-landing incident or accident involving one of the following: Loss of control;. Landing before reaching the runway (Undershoot on landing);. Hard landing;. Tail strike; or,. Runway overrun.. These safety occurrences can result from one or more of the following factors: Excessive sink rate. Incorrect flare technique (late or early flare initiation etc.). Excessive airspeed. Incorrect power management (inappropriate thrust on final approach (too high/too low) power-on touchdown). Loss of visual references.
