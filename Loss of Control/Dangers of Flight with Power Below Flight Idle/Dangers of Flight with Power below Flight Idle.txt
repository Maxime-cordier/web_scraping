Unless it is specifically permitted by the Airplane Flight Manual, any operation of the power lever below flight idle while in flight must be avoided. The PCU is not active and propeller blade angle is determined by power lever position while the levers are in the Beta Range. Therefore selection of a power setting below flight idle is very likely to result in a severe propeller overspeed and the resultant high, potentially dangerously high drag. Such high drag may result in an aerodynamic stall and/or loss of control if the drag is not symmetrical. Power lever operation to positions below flight idle is typically restricted to ground operations.
