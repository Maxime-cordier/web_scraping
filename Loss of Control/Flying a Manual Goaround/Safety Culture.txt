Go-rounds should never be met with any kind of negative feedback. Previous accidents have revealed pilots being reluctant to Go-round because they had been criticised for doing so earlier. In a large fleet, there will always be some pilots who have done more Go-rounds than others, as explained by the ‘Law of Large Numbers’ (which shows that some lottery numbers occur more than 4 times as often as others and, when plotted, fit under a normal distribution curve).
