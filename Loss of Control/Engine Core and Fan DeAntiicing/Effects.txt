The potential effects of engine core, intake or fan icing and/or contamination are numerous. They include: Fan blade damage - caused by failure to remove frozen deposits from the engine intake prior to start.. Fan blade damage - caused by not following ice shedding procedures for ground or in flight operations at an appropriate interval and in particular at any specifically recommended interval. If an excessive amount of ice is allowed to build up on the fan blades at low thrust settings, subsequent application of high thust can result in blade tip damage as the ice is shed.. Fan blade and engine core damage - caused by failure of or improper use of engine anti-ice. If ice builds up on the intake ring, it is possible that the deposits may detach and be ingested by the engine causing damage which could result in partial loss of thrust or even flameout.. Compressor stall or surging - may result from disrupted airflow into the compressor due to ice formation on the compressor blades.. Erroneous flight deck instrument indications - caused by ice-contaminated or ice-damaged engine probes.. In the worst case scenario, many of these effects could lead or contribute to the loss of the airframe.
