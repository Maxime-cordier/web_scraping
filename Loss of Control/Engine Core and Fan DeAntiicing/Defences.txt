To protect against engine damage due to contamination by frozen deposits, the following precautions should be taken prior to flight in weather conditions which are, or have recently been, conducive to their accretion within the engine: Once the engines have been started, the flight crew should use every means available to minimise contaminant buildup prior to takeoff: Use engine anti-ice as per manufacturer's guidelines. Engine anti-ice is normally turned on when the OAT is 10 degrees C or less and visible moisture is present. Pilots must be familiar with the Adverse Weather section of the Operating Manual for their particular type(s). Some engine types have a defined maximum ground exposure time to freezing rain or freezing fog due to core icing concerns. This time is cumulative and, if core de-icing procedures were not accomplished during a ground stop, the exposure time during the inbound taxi must be taken into consideration as part of the total exposure time. If the time limit is exceeded, the aircraft must return to the gate for engine core de-icing procedures.
