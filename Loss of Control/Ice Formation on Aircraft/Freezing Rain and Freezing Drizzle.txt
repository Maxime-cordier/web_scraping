Precipitation droplets that are clear of cloud are much larger than those within cloud and, if they are supercooled, they are described as creating Freezing Drizzle where droplets have a diameter of between 50 and 500 microns (0.05mm and 0.5mm) and Freezing Rain where the droplets exceed 500 microns (0.5mm) in diameter. Freezing Rain often has much larger droplets of 2mm diameter or more, although if they get much beyond 6mm in diameter, they will tend to break up. Freezing rain below cloud forms when rain droplets are supercooled by passage through a layer of air which has a sub-zero temperature. Since air temperatures normally increase as altitude reduces, freezing rain implies the existence of an air temperature inversion. Such conditions can occur below an advancing warm front or a warm occlusion where a relatively warm air mass is overrunning colder air. The existence of freezing rain normally means that there will be warmer air (above 0°C) above. The smaller supercooled droplets of freezing drizzle can also form in this way but it is generally considered that they more commonly arise by a different process called the collision-coalescence process. When, through condensation, some droplets in a cloud grow to approximately 30 micrometers in diameter, they begin to settle, falling fast enough so that they collide with some smaller droplets. If the droplets then coalesce, a larger droplet is produced and this now has an even better chance of ‘capturing’ smaller droplets. Under favorable conditions, this process can produce drizzle-size drops in a supercooled cloud, usually near the top, where the largest droplets generally are found in any cloud. Data capture has varied but some studies have reported that freezing drizzle in non-convective clouds forms more than 80 percent of the time by the collision-coalescence process. So, importantly, when in freezing drizzle, it cannot be assumed that warmer air (above 0°C) will exist above it.
