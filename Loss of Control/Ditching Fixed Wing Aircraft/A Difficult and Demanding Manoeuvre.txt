Ditching an aircraft into the sea, a river, or a lake, is a manoeuvre that, by definition, cannot be practiced and may be extremely hazardous. It is only contemplated when no other realistic option remains in an emergency. For fixed wing this may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. Even if the Sea State is slight, there is a strong possibility that a small aircraft will fail to remain upright and/or will sink rapidly and that a large fixed wing aircraft will suffer a loss of structural integrity on impact with the water surface. Limited available evidence suggests that such structural failure may be in the area of the centre fuselage and in the vicinity of the rear pressure bulkhead. If the occupants survive the ditching then, even with the benefit of protective clothing and equipment, in cold waters they may succumb to cold shock or hypothermia before they are rescued.
