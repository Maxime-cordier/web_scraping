A controlled ditching might be made in anticipation of a loss of control or its actual onset. In the case of most multi-engined fixed wing aircraft, this will be a consequence of the failure of more than 50% of the available engines because of: Fuel Contamination. Fuel Exhaustion. Fuel Starvation. Ingestion into more than one engine of large birds. Ingestion of high density volcanic ash. Other potential causes of an impending loss of control which could prompt a decision to ditch include uncontrollable and developing fire or structural failure and, for rotary wing aircraft over water, indications of imminent power transmission failure or loss of rotor integrity for which the procedural response is 'Land Immediately'.
