This article discusses weather-related flight risk management and practical measures if inadvertently encountering instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) conditions during a VFR flight. This article does not provide guidance on precision instrument flying; it is intended only to help the VFR pilot to keep their aeroplane under adequate control until suitable visual references are regained. Thorough pre-flight planning and full awareness of personal skill levels and experience should make this article, in the most part, unnecessary. Every human â€“ including weather forecasters and pilots - is liable to make errors. Therefore, the pilot should identify the risks that deteriorating en-route weather could present, particularly when the route is associated with any high ground, surface obstructions or proximity to controlled airspace, and consider how to manage those risks before the flight. In pre-flight planning, the pilot should consider not only what alternate courses of action will be available if the weather were to deteriorate, but also when those courses of action should be taken. For example, what would be the minimum visibility or cloud base needed to continue on track? Once airborne, these decisions are likely to be made under stress so pilots must also be aware of their own abilities and limitations, which may well be more limiting than the local regulations may require or the law demand. This article assumes that: All aircraft instruments are subject to pilot (mis)interpretation and have errors that generally increase with wear and age. Therefore, the pilot must understand correctly the flight instrument indications and limitations. Pre-flight checks to ensure the flight instruments are fully serviceable are critical. Encountering adverse flight conditions is not the time to discover an instrument(s) is unserviceable!
