In common with one other subject also critical to aircraft operational safety, aircraft ground de/anti icing, the quality of fuel ‘into-plane’ has been omitted from the ICAO system of safety oversight and there are no corresponding SARPs. Some National Regulators have in recent times reacted to this situation by re-iterating the ultimate responsibility of aircraft operators to ensure that they adequately address fuel contamination risk with adequate “Policies, Standards and Procedures” (PSPs) without continuing very far into the presentation of guidance or the specification of requirements. Fortunately, the subject of fuel quality and the prevention of contamination has been the subject of very comprehensive attention from both the supplier and consumer parts of the industry and this activity and the purposes it serves have now been summarised in the first ICAO Document dedicated to fuel quality, "Doc 9977 Manual on Civil Aviation Jet Fuel Supply" (2012). This publication acknowledges that its content does little more than highlight, based on industry assistance, the way that existing non statutory PSPs have acted collectively as a fuel quality management system. Appendix 2 ‘Regulatory Practices in States’ seeks “examples of effective regulatory oversight of the supply chain” from States and says that “on receipt of this information ICAO will consider including information on State regulatory roles in an amendment to, or a future edition of, this Manual”.
