^ Fuel which is “on specification” or “meeting the specification” is defined by the Energy Institute/Joint Inspection Group (see later for an explanation of this organisation) as “meeting the various maximum/minimum limits for fuel property tests and also satisfying all other aspects of the specification such as material composition, approved additives, quality assurance, management of change, cleanliness, traceability, etc.”. ^ Surfactants can be introduced as a contaminant by adsorption from multi-product pipeline walls and pumping equipment or be introduced from soaps or detergents used in equipment cleaning.. ^ Microbial contamination in Avgas is much less common than in Jet fuel, possibly due to the toxicity of tetraethyl lead, although it can occur..
