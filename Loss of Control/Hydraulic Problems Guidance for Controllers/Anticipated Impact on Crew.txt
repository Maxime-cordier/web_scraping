The crew that experiences problems with hydraulics might face the following: Downgraded flight characteristics - the crew could have difficulties controlling the aircraft that might vary from light to severe if all hydraulic systems are not present;. Increased stress in the cockpit - the crew would need to perform some preliminary checks to estimate the extent of reduction of the normal characteristics of the aircraft;. Increased time allowance - additional time might be needed in order to check the status of the problem and to initiate the required mitigations. It should be noted that some of the situations are present in SOPs or other documents with proper check-lists, but others may necessitate an ad hoc solution;. Manual flying - major damage of hydraulics would usually affect the auto-pilot functions;. Immediate landing - after assessing the situation, the crew could decide to carry out an immediate landing at the nearest (suitable) airport..
