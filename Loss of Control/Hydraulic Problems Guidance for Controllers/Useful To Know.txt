The hydraulic systems are the “muscles” of most modern aircraft. Hydraulic power is extensively used whenever the needed force is beyond human strength and/or the period of application is prolonged. Pressure is applied to liquid as media to transfer energy to specific points - various mechanical devices act as transformers, converting applied pressure, or a fraction of it, into movement, torque, etc. The movement of the pilot’s stick in a contemporary airliner initiates a series of control signals to actuators and other devices that transfer right amount of force to the proper control surface. As the hydraulic systems are of paramount importance for the safe flight, many design steps are taken to ensure reliability, redundancy and control. Often three independent hydraulic systems are in presence. They are fitted with different sources of power/pressurization, run in different lines and exchange pressure/liquid only under controlled conditions.
