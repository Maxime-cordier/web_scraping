Check bank and pitch on the ADI. For pitch use the ‘pitch ladder’ and remember that most ADIs have blue for sky and brown for ground. Even in extreme aircraft attitudes, some part of the sky or ground indication is usually visible. Compare ADI information with Airspeed/VSI/Altimeter before starting the recovery.. For a nose-low case: speed is probably increasing. altitude is probably decreasing. VSI is probably indicating a descent. For a nose-high case: Airspeed is probably decreasing. Altitude is probably increasing. VSI is probably indicating a climb. In both cases then: Cross Check the other attitude indicators - the SBY AH/ADI and the PNF ADI. Assess the aircraft energy state. Disengage the autopilot and auto throttle. Retract speedbrakes (if extended). Apply flight and engine control inputs to recover following the manufacturers’ and operators advice relevant to aircraft type..
