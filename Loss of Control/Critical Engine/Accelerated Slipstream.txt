Lift can be roughly defined as an upwards force resulting from an airstream going over and under a wing. On aircraft with propellers mounted on the wing, the propwash from the engine will accelerate the airstream over the portion of the wing directly behind the propeller. This results in greater lift behind the propeller than at other spots on the wing. From the P-factor effect, the right wing's center of lift will be further from the C.G. than the left-hand wing. While failure of either engine will cause a rolling motion towards the inoperative side, the rolling motion will be more severe with the right engine operating. Thus, the failure of the left-hand engine is critical. Again, this example depends on both engines turning clockwise when viewed from the rear.
