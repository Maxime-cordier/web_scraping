Note that manufacturer's procedures and AFM guidance take precedence over the following recommendations Note also that the procedures for recovery from a tailplane stall are essentially opposite to those for recovery from a wing stall. Misjudging the type of stall and applying the wrong procedures will make the situation significantly worse. If a sudden, un-commanded nose-down pitch occurs in combination with the symptoms of an impending tailplane stall, consider the following recovery actions: Disengage the autopilot (if engaged). Manually resist any nose down elevator movement. Immediately retract flaps to previous position if the pitching moment occurred during flap extension. Return power to the previous setting if the pitching moment occurred during a significant change in power setting. Note that in some aircraft types, an immediate power reduction may be appropriate as part of the initial recovery actions. Refer to manufacturer's guidance..
