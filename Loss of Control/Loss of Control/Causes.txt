The causes of in flight Loss of Control, whether transitory or terminal, are many and include: In-flight Loss of Control is (2007) the biggest single cause of transport aircraft fatal accidents and hull losses. More attention to recovery from unusual attitudes for larger aircraft operating without a visual horizon reference is also needed, since a significant proportion of airborne loss of control accidents still occur when, if recognition of an abnormal aircraft attitude had been followed promptly by the optimum recovery action, a fatal outcome could still have been avoided. The ‘Loss of Control’ issue for light aircraft is much more focused on marginal VFR weather and associated ‘press-on-itis’ and 'get-home-itis’ and on the consequences of operating aircraft which are not certificated for flight in icing conditions in such conditions, both intentionally and unintentionally. Light aircraft pilots not adequately trained in instrument flight who end up in conditions which require it may also end up unable to retain aircraft control until a visual horizon can be re-acquired.
