lift from the into wind wing and decreased lift from the down wind wing is not limited to the maximum advised by the manufacturer (and or licensing authority), the excessive up aileron and roll spoiler(s) deployment will result in an overall decrease in lift generated. To compensate for this a higher than normal angle of attack (body angle) would be required at liftoff which could be sufficient to cause a tail strike. Similarly, on approach and landing a crosswind can increase the risk of tail strike, particularly when conditions are gusty. If the aircraft is placed in an early forward slip attitude to compensate for the wind effects, this cross-control manoeuvre will reduce lift, increase drag, and may increase the rate of descent. If the aircraft subsequently descends into a turbulent surface layer, particularly if the wind is shifting toward the tail, the potential for tail strike becomes high. The combined effects of high runway closure rate, shifting winds, turbulence and the sudden drop in wind velocity commonly found below 100' can make the timing of the flare very difficult.. Over-Rotation During Go-Around - A go-around initiated during the flare or after a bounce is a common precursor to a tail strike. When the go-around mode is selected, the FD immediately commands a go-around pitch attitude. If the PF abruptly rotates into the command bars, tail strike can occur before a change to the flight path is achieved. Both pitch and thrust are required to execute a go-around, so if the engines are just spooling up when the PF abruptly pulls the nose up, the thrust may not yet be adequate for the manoeuvre. The nose will come up but the tail will also go down and may contact the runway. A contributing factor may be a strong desire of the flight crew to avoid wheel contact with the runway after initiating a late go-around..
