avoiding late change of runway or type of approach Assigning a landing RWY with no significant tailwind component Avoidance of vectoring too tightly onto final approach and intercepting glide path from above Providing crew correct information about distance to touchdown. Appropriate speed control instructions. Timely descent instructions.. The importance of avoiding late change of runway or type of approach. Assigning a landing RWY with no significant tailwind component. Avoidance of vectoring too tightly onto final approach and intercepting glide path from above. Providing crew correct information about distance to touchdown. ATM 8 – ANSPs should establish a formal interface between pilots and controllers where issues can be explored and a joint understanding can be reached. Implementation Advice: Pilots can be invited to attend controllers’ training sessions and vice versa Facilitated open days for pilots at ATC Units and familiarization flights for ATCOs Joint CRM training. Pilots can be invited to attend controllers’ training sessions and vice versa. Facilitated open days for pilots at ATC Units and familiarization flights for ATCOs. Joint CRM training. AM2 - Aircraft Manufacturers to ensure that go-around procedures presented in aircraft pilot training and aircraft operating manuals are applicable to go-arounds commenced at any stage on final approach up to and including landings rejected after touchdown.. REG1 - Regulatory Authorities to review the go-around training requirements and regulatory developments for pilots and ATCOs to ensure that the conclusions of this report are properly reflected..
