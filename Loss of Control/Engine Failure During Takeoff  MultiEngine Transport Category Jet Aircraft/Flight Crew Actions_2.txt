checklists, determine plan of action (diversion or recovery) and advise ATC. Note: The acceleration profiles utilised by VNAV and FLCH modes do not necessarily command the aircraft to fly level at Acceleration altitude in the event of an engine failure. With all engines operating, VNAV & FLCH will use the algorithm 60% climb, 40% acceleration. In the event of an engine failure, the algorithm is reversed with 40% climb, 60% acceleration. As a consequence, at light weights the APFDS may command a climb during the acceleration phase.
