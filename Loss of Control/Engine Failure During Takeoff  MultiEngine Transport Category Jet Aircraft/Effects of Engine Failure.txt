If a multi-engine aircraft suffers an engine failure during the takeoff roll, the aircraft will yaw towards the failed engine. If the airspeed at the time of the failure is at or above Vminimum control ground (Vmcg), directional control on the runway can be maintained utilizing only aerodynamic controls. At a speed below Vmcg, directional control will not be possible unless thrust on the operating engine(s) is (are) also reduced. In any event, if the airspeed at the time that the failure is recognised is less than V1, the takeoff must be rejected. If a multi-engine aircraft suffers an engine failure when airborne, there are two immediate aerodynamic effects. The initial effect is the yawing that occurs due to the asymmetry of the thrust line. The size of this initial yawing moment depends upon the engine thrust and the distance between the thrust line and the aircraft centre of gravity. The yawing moment is also affected initially by the rate of thrust decay of the ‘dead’ engine and ultimately by its drag. The second effect is roll. This occurs when the aircraft continues to yaw towards the failed engine resulting in a decrease in lift from the ‘retreating’ wing and a yaw-induced roll towards the failed engine. As well as the aerodynamic consequences of the failure, the performance penalty is very significant. While the failure of an engine in a twin engine aircraft represents a 50% loss of available power, it will result in a more than 50% loss of performance.
