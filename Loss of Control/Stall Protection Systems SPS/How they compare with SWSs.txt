Stall warning systems (SWS) provide visual, audible, and/or tactile (stick shaker) indications to the pilot that the aircraft is approaching the stall AoA. SWSs do not affect the pilot's control of the aircraft, and as such, the pilot may elect to ignore the stall warning system and command the aircraft into the stall (or uncontrolled) flight region. SPSs, conversely, prevent the aircraft from entering the stalled flight region by taking control of at least some of the flight control surfaces from the pilot and actuating the flight control surfaces to maintain the aircraft in the region below the stall AoA. Generally, stall protection systems prevent the aircraft AoA from exceeding the stall AoA so that the wing retains predictable lift characteristics and pilot manipulation of the control surfaces remains effective, with the exception that manipulation of the control surfaces that would cause the aircraft to exceed the stall AoA is prevented. Editor's Note: The crew should initiate approved recovery techniques at the first indication of an impending stall.
