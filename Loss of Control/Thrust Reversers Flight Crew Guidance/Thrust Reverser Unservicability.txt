When one or both thrust reversers have been identified by maintenance as unserviceable, it is usually permissible to despatch under MEL relief. In the absence of MEL conditions which entirely prohibit the use of any remaining serviceable thrust reverser(s), any such use should be predicated on the existence of flight crew guidance provided or endorsed by the aircraft operator. This guidance should be expressly briefed prior to every landing with such status and then followed.
