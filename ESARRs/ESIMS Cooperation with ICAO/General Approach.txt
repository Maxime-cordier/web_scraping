In view of the close synergies between the two Programmes, ESIMS was operated in close, formal cooperation with ICAOâ€™s USOAP. To formalise cooperation between the two Programmes, a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) was signed in 2005 between International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EUROCONTROL regarding safety oversight auditing, ensuring that detailed links are maintained between ICAO SOA and SRU at working and programme-management levels. ESIMS and ICAO USOAP audit schedules were coordinated to maximise synergies between the programmes. As part of the close working ties, ICAO SOA was given full access to ESIMS audit reports and, conversely, ESIMS had full access to USOAP audit reports. Through this cooperation, audit data and related information were routinely exchanged, optimising availability of information to both Programmes and minimising the time spent in auditing areas of common interest. The comparison of the ESIMS results with the findings related to the ANS part of the ICAO USOAP audits shows that, even though there are differences in the scope of both audit programmes, the problems and key issues raised are similar. The results of the USOAP audits can be used to support the recommendations made by various international organisations (EUROCONTROL, ICAO, the European Commission) with regard to the issues to be solved in the safety oversight of ATM/ANS.
