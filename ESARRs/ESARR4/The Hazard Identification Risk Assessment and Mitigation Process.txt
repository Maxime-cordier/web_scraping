The hazard identification, risk assessment and mitigation process includes: Determination of the scope, boundaries, functions and interfaces of the constituent part being considered, as well as its environment of operations.. Identification of ATM-related credible hazards, failure conditions and their combined effects.. Determination of the safety objectives to be placed on the constituent part.. Derivation of appropriate risk mitigation strategy, including development of safety requirements.. Verification of all identified safety objectives and safety requirements.. Collating and documenting the results, associated rationales and evidence to demonstrate that the constituent part under consideration, as well as the overall ATM system are, and will remain tolerably safe.. To achieve a harmonised implementation of the requirement by ATM service providers, a severity classification scheme for assessment of hazard effects and a risk classification scheme, as well as guidance for their application, are provided at Appendix A to ESARR 4. However, the risk classification scheme is incomplete due to the lack of required safety data. It is to be determined at national level based on past evidence on numbers of ATM related incidents.
