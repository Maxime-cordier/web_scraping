The regulatory authorities of ECAC states report through the ECIP process and the ESIMS programme the progress made in the implementation of ESARRs. Overall, there has been a regular progress in the implementation and enforcement of ESARRs at national level over the reporting year. The figure below represents the level of implementation of ESARRs as reported by States to the EUROCONTROL SRC. It is based on the information provided by 19 states out of 40 participating to the ESIMS programme. ESARR 1: No EUROCONTROL State and no EU State has implemented all of ESARR 1, while only three EU States state that they have implemented more than 80% of ESARR 1. Most States are waiting for the EC to transpose ESARR 1 into EC legislation. ESARR 2: Eight EUROCONTROL States (and six in the EU) confirm they have implemented all ESARR 2 requirements. Sixteen EUROCONTROL States (and thirteen in the EU) have implemented more than 80% of ESARR 2. This represents an improvement, but significant progress is urgently needed at national level to enforce ESARR 2, as well as related EC Directives 42/2003/EC and 56/1994/EC in EU Member States. ESARRs 3 & 4 Eleven EUROCONTROL States report that they have fully implemented ESARR 3 and six report that they have implemented ESARR 4. Most other EUROCONTROL Member States have implemented more than 80% of ESARRs 3 and 4. ESARR 5 Two EUROCONTROL States, including one EU Member State, report that they have implemented all of ESARR 5, while fourteen EUROCONTROL States report to have implemented more than 80% of ESARR 5 provisions. ESARR 6 Two EUROCONTROL States report that they have implemented ESARR 6.
