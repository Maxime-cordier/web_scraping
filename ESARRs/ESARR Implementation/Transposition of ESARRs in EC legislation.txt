A number of key ESARR provisions have been transposed into Community Law. This has been achieved through the CRs for the provision air navigation services, as well as EC Directives in the fields of controller licensing and incident investigation and analysis. In accordance with the SES CRs, the Commission are required to identify and adopt the EUROCONTROL safety regulatory requirements (ESARRs) and any subsequent amendments to those requirements. Substantial parts of ESARR 3, 4 and 5 are effectively dealt with in the SES CRs. However, current inconsistencies and differences in scope between SES CRs on safety and ESARRs could lead to discrepancies and complicate the implementation of the CRs and ESARRs at national level.
