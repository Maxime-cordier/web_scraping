The designated authority for the safety regulation of ATM personal is required to: Issue licenses in compliance with the obligatory provisions of ICAO Annex 1 and ESARR 5.. Approve competence examiners and assessors.. Ensure training requirements and competence schemes are complied with by ATS providers and individual personnel.. Establish requirements to ensure ongoing competence of the air traffic controllers.. Issue appropriate safety regulations for engineering and technical personnel who undertake operational safety related tasks.. Implement an appropriate audit process.. The ATS provider/operating organisation is required to: Apply unit training plans and competence schemes approved by the designated authority.. Implement fully documented competence monitoring and assessment procedures.. Ensure notification of the designated authority as required.. Individual personnel, when undertaking their tasks, are required to comply with the competence scheme, conditions and requirements determined by the national regulatory authority and the ATS provider/operating organisation. The competence of ATM personnel and, where applicable, their satisfaction of medical requirements, are fundamental elements of safety achievement, and therefore of safety management, in the provision of ATM services. The application of ESARR 5 aims to establish harmonised minimum levels of competency and proficiency for staff having specific ATM safety responsibilities.
