ESARR 6 is a further continuation of the safety regulatory process on risk assessment and mitigation and expands ESARR4 in regard to the software aspects of the ATM system. The requirement concerns the implementation of software assurance systems to ensure that the risks associated with the use of software safety related ground-based ATM systems are reduced to a tolerable level. For this purpose it provides a set of harmonised safety regulatory requirements concerning the ground component of the ATM system, and the ground-based supporting services (including communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems) under managerial control of the ATM service provider. ESARR 6 is not applicable to the airborne or space components of the of ATM systems. The requirement does not identify any software assurance standard as an acceptable means of compliance to meet its mandatory provisions. Accordingly, it does not prescribe any type of supporting means of compliance for software. The provisions of EASRR 6 have been developed on the bases that an a priori effective risk assessment and mitigation process is conducted to an appropriate level to ensure that due consideration is given to all aspects of ATM, including ATM functions to be performed by software.
