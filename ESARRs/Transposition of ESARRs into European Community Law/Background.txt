The EUROCONTROL Safety Regulatory Requirements (ESARRs) were developed by the EUROCONTROL Safety Regulation Commission (SRC) with the objective to define and support the achievement of consistent safety levels in the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) area. At present there are six ESARRs: According to the decisions of the EUROCONTROL Permanent Commission all Member States are required to implement the ESARR provisions. In addition, the ECAC states, which are not members of the EUROCONTROL organisation, are strongly encouraged to implement the ESARRs. Within the framework of the Single European Sky (SES) initiative the European Commission transposed the great majority of these safety regulatory requirements into Community Law, thus giving them increased legal effect. Those requirements, which are not directly applicable in the EU Member Sates, should be integrated into the national regulatory framework through the appropriate legislative instruments. The transposition process does not result in ESARRs and Community rules which are identical in all cases. Some differences in provisions and/or their scope continue to exist. These issues fall under the generic heading of “double regulation”, and continue to be addressed jointly by EUROCONTROL and the European Commission. Further details below.
