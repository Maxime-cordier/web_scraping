The ICAO minima are detailed and illustrated in PANS-ATM Doc 4444. They are defined for aircraft under ATC control which have not reported the preceding aircraft in sight and have been instructed to follow and maintain their own separation from that aircraft visually. If the latter occurs in the case of an IFR aircraft then the pilot-in-command of the aircraft concerned becomes responsible for ensuring that the spacing from a preceding aircraft of a heavier wake turbulence category is acceptable. The distance between two aircraft on arrival or departure is used where radar separation of traffic is being applied and the time between the successive passage of two aircraft at a point is used where procedural separation applies. Since relatively few airports routinely use radar separation for take off and initial climb, the practical effect of this distinction on IFR traffic is that wake turbulence separations between arriving aircraft are based upon distance and those between departing aircraft are by time interval - at rotation, since this is where wake vortices begin. Note: The separation minima described in this article are based on the aircraft categorization into 4 categories (Super, Heavy, Medium and Light). Additional minima are defined by ICAO in case wake turbulence groups A to G are used. The use of these groups is subject to the approval by the appropriate ATS authority.
