States may elect to operate variations to the ICAO scheme if they wish. One example of this is the UK where the main differences are the re-definition of the lower weight end of the ICAO ‘MEDIUM’ category: An extra category called ‘SMALL’ is defined as aircraft types with an MTOM (maximum take-off mass) of between 17000 kg and 40000 kg. The ‘LIGHT’ Category defined in the ICAO scheme is extended to cover aircraft types with an MTOM of up to 17000 kg. In 1997 a further modification was made for the purpose of separation in the approach phase at London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London Stansted and Manchester airports, and at London Luton in 1999, by dividing the Medium category for landing aircraft into Upper and Lower Medium. In light of the safe operational experience over the years since 1997 it was decided in 2010 to extend this categorisation to all UK aerodromes. Full details of the UK variations are contained in UK AIC P 001/2015 - Wake Turbulence B757. Some states apply a higher category to B757 aircraft than that suggested by the aircraft's weight in case it is the preceding aircraft (i.e. the one generating the wake turbulence)..
