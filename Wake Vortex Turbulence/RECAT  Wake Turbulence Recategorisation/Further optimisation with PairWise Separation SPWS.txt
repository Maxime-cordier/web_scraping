An additional optimisation is obtained by the specification of wake turbulence minima on an aircraft by aircraft basis, with the characterisation of wake turbulence generation and of encounter resistance per aircraft type, and related risk assessment, as refinement from RECAT-EU. This led to the establishment of static Pair-Wise Separation (S-PWS) Minima (also called RECAT-EU-PWS) for 103x 103 aircraft types, representing more than 95% of the European traffic at major airports, together with RECAT 20-Category to complement for the whole fleet. The development of ‘S-PWS’ solution for Approach and Departure, was led by EUROCONTROL under the SESAR2020 programme, referred as PJ02.01.04 (S-PWS-A) and PJ02.01.06 (S-PWS-D) solutions. The minima are derived on the basis of the same methodology as used in RECAT-EU, however aligning the wake turbulence encounter risk on a pair-wise basis, delivering further separation reduction of 0.5NM or 1NM for some frequent aircraft pairs. On this, EUROCONTROL has produced a generic Safety Case, submitted to EASA for review and recommendations, in support of regulatory acceptance of local deployments. There are several ways to operate the RECAT-EU-PWS scheme: on a pair-wise basis (with ATC separation delivery tool support such as used for enabling Time-Based Separation - TBS), on a categorical system basis (with/without ATC separation delivery tool support), or on a procedural basis for selected aircraft type pairs in view of upgrading the applied wake categorisation scheme and bringing quick wins. A presentation of the RECAT-EU-PWS scheme is available on the EUROCONTROL Airport page. Further development of dynamic PWS minima (D-PWS), based on dynamic evolution of generated wake turbulence as a function of the prevailing weather conditions, are also under development under SESAR industrial research programme.
