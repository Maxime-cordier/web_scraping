Immediate benefits, in terms of runway capacity and operational efficiencies, will result from implementation of RECAT protocols. These benefits include: Peak period runway throughput can increase by 5% or more depending on airport traffic mix.. For an equivalent volume of traffic, RECAT spacing results in a reduction of the overall flight time for each affected aircraft reducing fuel burn, emissions and operating costs.. Due to more efficient departure and arrival spacing, RECAT allows a more rapid recovery from adverse conditions or a runway change.. In airspace trending towards saturation, such is the case in Europe, the projected fleet renewal is trending towards a greater percentage of larger aircraft. Under RECAT, this evolution will actually further enhance runway capacity..
