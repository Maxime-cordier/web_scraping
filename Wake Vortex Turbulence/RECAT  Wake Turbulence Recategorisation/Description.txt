The existing International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) wake vortex separation rules are based solely upon aircraft weight, categorised as Heavy, Medium or Light. While safe, in some respects, they are now outdated and lead to over-separation in many instances. This, in turn, diminishes airport capacity and causes unnecessary traffic delays increasing costs, fuel burn and emissions. As an example, both the Boeing 747 and the Boeing 767 are categorised by ICAO as "Heavy" aircraft. Whilst the 4nm traditional separation distance, applied between two "heavies", is appropriate when the 767 is following the 747, in the reciprocal case, standard separation is excessive. To safely reduce the separation minima between a given aircraft pair, whether on departure or on final approach, both the wake vortex generated by the leader and the following aircraftâ€™s resistance to it have to be taken into consideration.
