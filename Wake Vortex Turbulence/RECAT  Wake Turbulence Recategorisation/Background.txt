The ICAO categorisation of aircraft into three weight dependent groups has, for some time, been considered inadequate by many National Aviation Authorities and this has led to some regional variation in the categories and separation standards. The introduction of the Airbus A380 and the associated wake vortex turbulence concerns lead to an ICAO supervised joint study with experts from Airbus, the FAA, EUROCONTROL and JAA/EASA. The primary focus of the study was the A380 and the resulting Airbus A380 Wake Vortex Guidance was published in 2008. However, the supporting programme of over 180 hours of innovative flight testing including back to back comparative testing of different aircraft, cruise wake encounter tests, and ground and airborne LIDAR wake measurements, also led to the introduction of the RECAT programme.
