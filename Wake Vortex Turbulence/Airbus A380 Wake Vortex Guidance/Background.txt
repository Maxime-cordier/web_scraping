A study on Airbus A380 wake vortex aspects was conducted by an ad-hoc group of experts including AIRBUS, FAA, EUROCONTROL and JAA/EASA under the supervision of ICAO. Based on the extensive flight test programme, the group produced the Airbus A380-800 Wake Vortex Guidance in 2008. This guidance is supported by an unprecedented programme of flight tests with innovative aspects, such as back to back comparative testing of different aircraft, cruise wake encounter tests, and ground and airborne LIDAR wake measurements, totalling over 180 hours flight time.
