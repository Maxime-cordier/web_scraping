Leading aircraft weight. Leading aircraft speed. Leading aircraft wing configuration (Flap setting etc.). Relative size of leading and following aircraft. Relative tracks, positions and lateral/vertical separation of proximate aircraft - the hazard is greater for aircraft following the same track/profile is greater than for the cross-track case. Closeness to the ground - vortex ceases to be hazardous when ground contact occurs. Wind direction relative to the track being flown by the generating aircraft - a cross-track wind reduces the risk to in-train aircraft. Wind speed - light winds delay decay. Turbulence, from sources other than wake vortex, accelerates vortex decay.
