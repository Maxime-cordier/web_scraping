In forward flight, the downwash from the main rotor of a helicopter is transformed into a pair of trailing vortices comparable to the wing tip vortices generated by a fixed wing aircraft and there is some evidence that these vortices are more intense than those from a similar-weight fixed-wing aircraft. It is therefore recommended that helicopters should be operated well clear of light aircraft when hovering or whilst air taxiing. Two blade main rotor systems, typical of lighter helicopters, produce stronger wake than rotor systems with more blades. The strength of the vortex depends not only on the blade geometry and loading, but also on the aircraft's operational state (i.e., hovering, climbing, descending, or manoeuvring) but is more pronounced in forward flight, especially when pitch is being applied, such as at take off or landing When the descent velocity of a rotor approximately matches its wake's velocity, the helical wake tends to roll up into a thick vortex ring that remains near the rotor plane and interferes with the rotor's inflow. Vortex Ring may be considered as the helicopter equivalent of aerodynamic stall and is generally of greater danger to the helicopter than to other aircraft in the vicinity becuase other aircraft are unlikely to fly a profile in proximity to such wake turbulence of vertical, rather than horizontal, extent. Note that downwash, although not a vortex issue, must always be considered if planning to pass above a light aircraft.
