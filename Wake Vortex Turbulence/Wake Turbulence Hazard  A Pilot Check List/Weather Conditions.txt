The type of weather conditions in which pilots can most expect to encounter wake turbulence are: stable, still/light wind conditions;. wind direction down the runway.. Conversely, low level turbulence, associated with stronger wind conditions, accelerates vortex decay and cross winds deflect vortices away from the runway centreline.
