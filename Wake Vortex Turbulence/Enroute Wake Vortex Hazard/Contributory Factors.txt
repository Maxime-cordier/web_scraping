Leading aircraft weight - Heavy category types, in particular with MTOW above 350T (incl. AIRBUS A-340-500, AIRBUS A-340-600, AIRBUS A-380-800, BOEING 747-400 (international, winglets), BOEING 747-8, BOEING 777-300ER) induce strongest wake turbulence levels.. Relative size of leading and following aircraft;. Relative tracks, positions and lateral/vertical separation of proximate aircraft - the risk is greater for aircraft following the same track/profile than for the cross-track case aircraft which are climbing or descending behind a Heavy category aircraft in level flight or an aircraft in level flight with a Heavy category aircraft climbing or descending ahead;. flying below the tropopause - the atmospheric conditions are generally favourable for the wake vortex to remain strong for a longer period of time, and the wake vortices may potentially descend one flight level lower;. Wind velocity relative to the track being flown by the generating aircraft - cross-track wind reduces the risk to in-train aircraft.
