Our perception of a situation, both in objectivity and context, is known as Situational Awareness. The problems we have in perceiving the world accurately, discussed above, mean that we cannot rely totally on our senses and past experiences for maintaining good situational awareness. Gaining and maintaining effective situational awareness requires pilots to utilise objective data. That means two things: relying on flight instruments and FMS in preference to vision, balance, sensations of movement and other kinaesthetic feelings, and. seeking, analysing and utilising the most appropriate up-to-date information concerning context, such as weather, aircraft performance, crew performance, runway and aerodrome conditions, en-route conditions, terrain, possible emergencies and contingency plans..
