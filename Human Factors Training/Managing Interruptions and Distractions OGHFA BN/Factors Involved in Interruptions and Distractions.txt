Interruptions and distractions in the cockpit may be subtle and momentary or intrusive, obvious and continuing, but all can be disruptive to the flight crew. A study by the NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS)) in 1998 indicated that there are four primary factors that generate interruptions or distractions: Over time, the ASRS database has been used to estimate the respective contributions of these four sources to interruptions and distractions. These estimates are shown in Table 2. Sources: NASA - ASRS The four factors shown in Table 2 are behaviours of the flightcrew. A variety of other contributing factors can make these and other flight events more likely to result in interruptions and distractions. These include: It is also important to note that interruptions and distractions need not be large or of long duration to result in a safety problem. Even minor disruptions (e.g., a non-threatening equipment malfunction) can turn a routine flight into a challenging event, particularly for a crew at the end of a long, tiring day of flying.
