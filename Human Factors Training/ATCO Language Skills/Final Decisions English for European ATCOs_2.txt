and aircraft, at aerodromes with more than 50,000 international IFR movements per year;. “[European Union] member states, where at the date of entry into force of this regulation, the English language is not the only language used for communications between the [air traffic service] unit and aircraft at such aerodromes, may decide not to apply the requirement to use the English language and inform the [European] Commission accordingly;. “In that case, those member states shall, by 31 December 2017 at the latest, conduct a study on the possibility to require the use of the English language for communications between the ATS unit and aircraft at those aerodromes for reasons of safety, so as to avoid incursions of aircraft on an occupied runway or other safety risks, while taking into account the applicable provisions of [European] Union and national law on the use of languages; [and,] “The languages available at a given station on the ground shall form part of the [state’s] Aeronautical Information Publication and other published aeronautical information concerning such facilities.”. Beyond these provisions applicable to all NAAs and ANSPs, SERA.14015 recognises that some NAAs and ANSPs may want to modify ATCOs’ use of English language at specific aerodromes with more than 50,000 international IFR movements per year. If suitable justification is provided, EASA can accept deviations “for specific cases, based on an individual assessment of the local arrangements. In any case, deviation from the requirement should be limited to exceptional cases and should be accompanied with a safety assessment.” The independent assessment of the proposed deviation’s safety impact requires consulting any available accident and incident investigation reports (at least at the EU level) in which ATCOs’ use of any language has been identified as an accident’s contributing factor. The NAA also is expected to document “the proportion of pilots frequenting that airport, with English language proficiency endorsement [and] the proportion of pilots frequenting that airport, lacking language proficiency endorsement in the alternative language to be used.” Through SERA’s provisions, EASA also encourages NAAs/ANSPs to consider requiring ATCOs’ use of the English language at aerodromes with less than 50,000 international IFR movements per year “based on local needs, such as seasonally high levels of international air traffic.”
