In October 2013, ICAO reiterated the purpose of ATCO LPRs in Resolution A38/8 —“Proficiency in the English Language Used for Radiotelephony Communications.” The resolution explains: “To prevent accidents, ICAO introduced language provisions to ensure that [ATCOs] and pilots are proficient in conducting and comprehending radiotelephony communications in the English language, including requirements that the English language shall be available on request at all stations on the ground serving designated airports and routes used by international air services.” The resolution also reinforced, and called on states to increase their efforts, in the following areas: Reinforce the requirement to use ICAO standardised phraseology;. Emulate other states that “have made substantial efforts to comply” with the language proficiency requirements;. Assist states that encounter considerable difficulties in implementing the LPRs, such as their language training and testing capabilities;. Immediately notify ICAO whenever a state “finds it impracticable to comply in all respects with any international standard or procedure.”;. Disclose — by endorsement text printed on or attached to the ATCO/pilot licence — any failure of the licence holder to satisfy the LPRs, and enforce the international standard so that “no personnel having certificates or licences so endorsed shall participate in international navigation, except with the permission of the state or states whose territory is entered.”.
