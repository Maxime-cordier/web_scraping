EBT recognises the need to develop and evaluate crew performance according to a set of competencies without necessarily distinguishing between the ‘non-technical’ (e.g. CRM) and the ‘technical’ competencies needed in order to operate safely. Any area of competence assessed by EBT instructors not to meet the required level of performance needs to be associated with an observable behaviour that could lead to an unacceptable reduction in safety margins. Under EBT the following are the competencies that trainees are required to demonstrate and EBT instructor are required to be able to accurately assess: 1. Application of Procedures; 2. Communication; 3. Aircraft Flight Path Management, automation; 4. Aircraft Flight Path Management, manual control; 5. Leadership and Teamwork; 6. Problem Solving and Decision Making; 7. Situation Awareness; 8. Workload Management
