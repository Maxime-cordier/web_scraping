The evidence-based training project is a global safety improvement initiative in the training environment supported by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The origin of EBT arose from an industry-wide consensus that, in order to reduce the airline accident rate, a strategic review of recurrent and type-rating training for airline pilots was necessary. The international standards and national regulations for airline pilot training are largely based on the evidence of accidents involving jet aircraft of the early generations, in the apparent belief that simply repeating pilot exposure to ‘worst case’ events in training is enough. Over time, new types of events occurred that were simply added to the requirements resulting into progressively crowded training programmes. This led to a ‘tick box’ approach to training.
