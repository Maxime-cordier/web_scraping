ELPAC Paper 1 (Listening Comprehension) tests the understanding of communications between pilots and controllers in both routine and non-routine situations. The recordings are based on authentic material and range from short standard pilot transmissions to longer communications in which the pilot deals with non-routine or unusual situations.

This includes: switching between structured phrases and plain English. making an appropriate report on an unusual ATC-related event. resolving misunderstandings. effectively managing the relationship between pilot and controller. negotiating meaning. producing extended speech in an aviation context.
