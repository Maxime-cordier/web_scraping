When pilots commence flying training they are quickly exposed to vast amounts of information (technical, operational, practical, theoretical) as well as having to learn, practice and develop their flying, flight and aircraft management skills. From “day 1” pilots learn to utilise mnemonics and aphorisms to remember checks, procedures and practices; and these techniques remain with them throughout their careers. Learning to use effectively such memory aids can help pilots in at least two distinct ways: freeing-up working memory during routine operations, and. directing the mind towards required actions during periods of uncertainty, or intense activity and/or emergency; i.e. preventing distraction from less critical issues..
