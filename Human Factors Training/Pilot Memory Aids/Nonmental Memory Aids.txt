Pilots will use the aircraft displays to aid their memories. When the situation demands, pilots have been known to use other visual memory aids, e.g. dayglow sticky labels on pulled circuit breakers, or a brightly coloured clipboard placed across throttles. These may be constant reminders that e.g. a system is not working, or fuel dumping is currently in progress. The “ultimate” pilot memory aid is another crew member, specifically designated to pass information at a specific time, or when specific conditions are met e.g. the pilot monitoring calling 1000 feet to level or monitoring the anti-icing holdover time remaining. This short section highlights the importance of Crew Resource Management (CRM) in aiding a pilot’s memory.
