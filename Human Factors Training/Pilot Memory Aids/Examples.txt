Many memory aids are simple aphorisms used to remember certain principles. Rules of thumb are common, although not always correct! General rejoinders to “pay attention” and/or “prioritise”. Airlines tend to “design” their own memory aids to assist pilots in dealing with uncertain situations – problem-solving and decision-making. Some memory aids concern behaviour and professionalism. Some memory aids apply as constant reminders that improve situational awareness. Checklists are often remembered through mnemonics and acronyms, however, these will be specific actions for a particular type of aircraft. Briefings for all phases of pre-flight, flight and post-flight often follow set patterns to ensure all details are included. Pilots will use memory aids to achieve this, either written checklists or a mental hook. However, due to the importance of a comprehensive briefing in enhancing safety, pilots will more often use a written checklist, and in many cases this can be a requirement of the airline. For instance, a pre-descent briefing will need to cover many subjects: weather, top of descent position, descent profile, navigation, instruments, communication, terrain, approach, missed approach, diversion, responsibilities and crew tasks, contingency plans etc. Making an acronym to cover all this is not only difficult, but will expose pilots to memory and procedural errors.
