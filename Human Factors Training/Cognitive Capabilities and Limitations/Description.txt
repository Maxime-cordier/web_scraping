This article introduces a collection SKYbrary articles that address related subjects that often arise in the domain of aviation human factors. They also help explain the basics of human cognitive capabilities and limitations. Subject matter experts frequently analyse errors in aviation according to common principles for recognising unconscious cognitive biases, situational awareness, vigilance, attention, preoccupation, information processing, decision making and memory. Behaviours of air traffic controllers and flight crews that have been investigated after accidents and serious incidents, and leessons from their experiences, are cited here as examples but the principles also apply to other aviation professions.
