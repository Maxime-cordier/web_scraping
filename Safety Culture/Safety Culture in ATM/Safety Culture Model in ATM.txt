Researchers and practitioners have proposed numerous Safety Culture models in recent years. The model presented below includes several dimensions on which an organisation’s Safety Culture can be defined and evaluated. Reason (1997) and Hudson (2003) suggest that an organisation's Safety Culture is defined by the extent to which it is: Informed: Managers know what is going on in their organisation and the workforce is willing to report their own errors and near misses.. Reporting: The organisation encourages employees to divulge information about all safety hazards that they encounter.. Just: The organisation has a ’just and fair' approach to errors, but requires individuals to be accountable and applies appropriate penalties to unacceptable actions (violations). (See Just Culture). Flexible: Such organisations reflect changes in demand, providing both high tempo and routine modes of operation.. Learning: Organisations are ready to learn and improve, and have the will to implement reforms when required.. The theoretical background underlying the EUROCONTROL Safety Culture Model (See Figure 1) is based on a dynamic definition of Safety Culture, which embodies three major questions representing core dimensions of Safety Culture: How committed are we to safety?. How are we involved in safety?. How do we learn?.
