Managing any significant change within an organisation - and all the more so a cultural change - implies to organise and follow some specific steps: Developing a clear vision, showing not only the direction of the change, but also the underlying values. Creating the right climate for change: establish a need for it, a sense of purpose and urgency. Sharing the vision with employees, clearly communicating the vision. Not permitting roadblocks against the vision. Empowering people to act and clear obstacles. Employees should feel trusted by the management. Building a coalition of driving forces. Setting the relevant human resources: people need the time and space in their work schedules to be able to work on the changes. Setting the plan and the agenda, including short-term wins. Coordinating activities.. Implementing intentions. It is important that visible changes occur in operational activities as quickly as possible. This will require behaviour changes at all levels of the organisation, not just at the workplace (behaviour modification is unlikely to be successful unless the job environment and organisational factors are also changed).. Intentions are implemented and transformed through time, and can lead to new strategic changes. Frequent updates about change programs.. Consolidating first outcomes and keeping moving. Not declaring victory too soon. Securing short-term wins. Anchoring the change. Follow-up programme.
