Donna Hicks, Ph.D. has spent over two decades facilitating resolution of international conflicts and has devised her “Dignity Model”[5] which she uses with corporations and organisations worldwide. The key points of this Model are shown below to offer a counterpoint to the usual “aviation” take on cultural diversity. This model is a useful personal tool for working with people from diverse socio-cultural backgrounds. Acceptance of Identity – approach people as being neither inferior or superior to yourself; interact without prejudice or bias; accept that people will identify themselves through their cultural backgrounds (race, religion etc.). Inclusion – make others feel they belong. Safety – put people at ease and help them feel free to speak without fear of retribution. Acknowledgement – give people full attention and respond to them. Recognition – validate people for their efforts and be generous with praise for their contributions. Fairness – treat people justly and with equality. Benefit of the Doubt – start with the assumption that people are trustworthy and behave with integrity. Understanding – give people the chance to explain and believe that what they think matters. Independence – encourage people to act on their own behalf so they feel in control NB:this point may not be always appropriate to the aviation setting; however, workers are more likely to be, and feel, engaged when they have a degree of control over their own futures. Accountability – take responsibility for your own actions – apologise if you violate another’s dignity.
