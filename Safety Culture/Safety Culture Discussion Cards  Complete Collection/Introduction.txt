The EUROCONTROL Safety Culture Discussion Cards are a practical resource to aid real discussion about safety culture by any person or team within any organisation, including staff and managers in air navigation service providers. The cards use the same concepts as the EUROCONTROL survey methodology, though everyday language is used to make the cards completely accessible. The cards can be used without the need for external support.
