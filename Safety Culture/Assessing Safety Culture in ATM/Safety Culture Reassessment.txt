Following the completion of a Safety Culture assessment and implementation of the improvement plan, it is recommended that re-assessment is conducted to: evaluate the effectiveness of the improvement strategies. promote continuous improvement by identifying ongoing weaknesses. fine-tune improvement efforts to reflect changes in Safety Culture strengths and weaknesses. reaffirm commitment to Safety Culture improvement, and defend against other projects being given priority.. The Safety Culture assessment campaign, from the launch to the decisions for change by the ANSP management, can take about a year (see Figure 1). More time will be required before an organisation can implement the change strategies and see the early outcomes of any improvements. Therefore, a re-assessment campaign will be relevant only after two to three years.
