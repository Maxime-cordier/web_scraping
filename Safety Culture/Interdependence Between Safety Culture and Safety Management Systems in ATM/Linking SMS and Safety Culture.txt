(See Figure 1) Figure 1 - Interdependence between SMS and Safety Culture in an organisation.

The outcome of these features is an adequate cognisance, referring to the organisationâ€™s correct awareness and understanding of the threats to its operations, which in turn shapes behaviours towards safety.
