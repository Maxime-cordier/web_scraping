The following list shows tips to improve SMS through principles inherent to Safety Culture: Consider the SMS as a ‘living system’ that should reflect best industry practice matched against the particular needs of your ANSP..

Make sure there is a clear focus on risks associated with human factors. These are known to contribute to the majority of accidents, yet are often less well-understood in technology-based industries..
