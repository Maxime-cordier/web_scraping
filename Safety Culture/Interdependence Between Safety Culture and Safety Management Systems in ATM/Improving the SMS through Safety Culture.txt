A properly implemented SMS operates in a complementary and interdependent way with the Safety Culture to create a safer organisation. The SMS must be actively improved and realised. A SMS represents an organisationâ€™s competence in the area of safety, and it is important to have an SMS and competent safety staff to execute it. Safety Culture can be summarised as the degree of commitment to safety evident throughout the organisation. This includes a commitment to use the SMS as intended.
