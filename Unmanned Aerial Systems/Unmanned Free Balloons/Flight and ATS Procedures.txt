The ATS unit concerned are to be notified of the flight of a medium or heavy unmanned free balloon at least 7 days in advance. The notification is to contain pertinent information such as balloon classification, SSR code, launch site, estimated time of launch, cruising level, estimate for passing 60 000 ft, etc. Any change to that information is to be forwarded to the ATS unit at least 6 hours before launch. The actual launch information is to be forwarded to the ATS unit concerned together with any changes (if any) to the data previously provided. If the flight is cancelled, this information is also to be provided to the ATS unit.. During the flight, the operator of a heavy unmanned free balloon operating at or below 60 000 ft must monitor the flight path and forward position reports as requested by air traffic services, at least every two hours. If the balloon operates above 60 000 ft, the frequency of these reports can be increased to once per 24 hours.. The planned descent of a heavy balloon is to be notified to the ATS unit at least one hour prior. The message must include an estimate for crossing 60 000 ft altitude, if applicable.. The operator must inform the ATS unit when the operation of a heavy or medium balloon has been completed.. ATS units forward the information about unmanned free balloons to other aircraft concerned. Example phraseology: TRAFFIC IS (classification) UNMANNED FREE BALLOON(S) WAS [or ESTIMATED] OVER (place) AT (time) REPORTED (level(s)) [or LEVEL UNKNOWN] MOVING (direction) (other pertinent information, if any). TRAFFIC IS (classification) UNMANNED FREE BALLOON(S) WAS [or ESTIMATED] OVER (place) AT (time) REPORTED (level(s)) [or LEVEL UNKNOWN] MOVING (direction) (other pertinent information, if any). Upon receiving the information about the planned flight of a medium or heavy balloon, the ATS unit must forward this information to other ATS unit(s) concerned. After launch, they are to forward that information as well. Example phraseology: ESTIMATE UNMANNED FREE BALLOON(S) (identification and classification) ESTIMATED OVER (place) AT (time) REPORTED FLIGHT LEVEL(S) (figure or figures) [or FLIGHT LEVEL UNKNOWN] MOVING (direction) ESTIMATED GROUND SPEED (figure) (other pertinent information, if any). ESTIMATE UNMANNED FREE BALLOON(S) (identification and classification) ESTIMATED OVER (place) AT (time) REPORTED FLIGHT LEVEL(S) (figure or figures) [or FLIGHT LEVEL UNKNOWN] MOVING (direction) ESTIMATED GROUND SPEED (figure) (other pertinent information, if any). ATS units must monitor the movement of medium or heavy unmanned free balloons using surveillance equipment to the extent possible and provide separation to other aircraft as necessary (in controlled airspace) or on request by pilots (in uncontrolled airspace)..
