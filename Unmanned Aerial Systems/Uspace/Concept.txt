U-space is the European system that is being developed to manage UAS (unmanned aerial systems) traffic. It is a set of specific services and procedures designed to ensure safe and efficient access to airspace for UAS. The purpose of U-space is to achieve automated UAS management and integration, allowing for a large series of operations, many of them simultaneous. The process is to be integrated with the current ATM system. The first step of establishing U-space is to define and designate U-space airspaces. These are volumes of airspace where, as a minimum, mandatory U-space services will be provided (see section "Services" below for details). The process of U-space airspace designation is done by the EU member states. If a U-space airspace is designated within controlled airspace, it must be subject to dynamic reconfiguration. The ATC unit may temporarily limit the area where UAS operations can take place in order to meet manned traffic demand. This is done in order to make sure that manned aircraft which are provided with an air traffic control service and UAS remain segregated. Dynamic airspace reconfiguration is not necessary for VFR flights in airspace class E and for all flights in classes F and G. In these cases, traffic information is to be provided to the affected manned flights. The services within the U-space airspace are provided by U-space service providers. Unlike the provision of air traffic control service where only one provider can be responsible for a particular volume of airspace, there may be multiple U-space service providers serving the same U-space airspace. U-space service providers must: Note: UAS operators may provide U-space services to themselves. In this case, they must comply with the requirements for both UAS operators and U-space serviece providers.
