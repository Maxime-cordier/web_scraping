UA operations are classified in three risk-based categories: Only the "open" and "specific" operations are covered by the prototype regulation. The "open" category is further divided into four subcategories, based on technical requirements, operational limitations and requirements for the remote pilot or operator. The subcategories are: For operations in the "open" category, risks are to be mitigated through a combination of safety measures, e.g. requirements and limitations on the operation, the UAS, and the personnel and organisations involved as well as other limitations to be defined by the competent authority for geofencing purposes or for particular airspace areas. For operations in the "specific" category, risks are to be mitigated through safety measures identified in an operational risk assessment or contained in a standard scenario published by EASA.
