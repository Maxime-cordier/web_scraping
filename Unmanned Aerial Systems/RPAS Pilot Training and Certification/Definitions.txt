The following definitions come from ICAO’s 2017 concept of operations for future international RPAS flights under instrument flight rules (IFR), as discussed later in this article, and ICAO Doc 9379, Manual of Procedures for Establishment and Management of a State’s Personnel Licensing System (Second Edition, 2012): Remotely piloted aircraft — An unmanned aircraft piloted from a remote pilot station. (ICAO sees RPAS as a subset of UAS; UAS includes RPAS, autonomous aircraft and model aircraft);. Remote pilot station — The component of the RPAS containing the equipment used to pilot the RPA;. Remote pilot — A person charged by the operator with duties essential to the operation of an RPA and who manipulates the flight controls, as appropriate, during flight time;. Remote pilot licence — A certificate accepted as tangible evidence that the holders responsible for safety of flight are knowledgeable, trained, experienced and otherwise qualified in their respective duties. “A licence is the means by which a State authorizes a licence holder to perform specific activities which, unless performed properly, could jeopardize the safety of aviation. The licence provides evidence that the issuing State is satisfied that the holder has demonstrated an internationally acceptable degree of competency.”;. RPAS operator certificate — A certificate from a national aviation authority authorizing an operator to carry out specified RPAS operations;.
