According to reports from EUROCONTROL, the SESAR Horizon 2020 PODIUM project began demonstrating UTM services, procedures and technologies in 2018 and 2019 at four operational sites in Denmark, France and the Netherlands. The project supports U-Space — a term defined as “the European vision for the safe, secure and efficient handling of drone traffic.” (The acronym PODIUM stands for Proving Operations of Drones with Initial UTM. The acronym SESAR stands for Single European Sky ATM Research Joint Undertaking.) As leader of the consortium conducting the project, EUROCONTROL is responsible for this work’s alignment with overall strategies affecting European ATM and RPAS. European stakeholders predict that UTM will be a key initial solution to what PODIUM project leaders call “increasing and unmanaged drone traffic and their relatively small size [that] can pose a threat to manned aviation.” Their areas of focus include: Documenting how UTM provides mutual traffic situational awareness for the local participants;. The role of ATM in facilitating operators’ day-to-day drone management;. Reducing risks inherent in UTM deployments through “a comprehensive Web-based UTM system, using tracking systems based on Mode-S, L-Band and GSM networks for real-time tracking of RPAs;. Demonstrating U-Space services;. Communicating conclusions about the maturity of U-Space services and technologies;. Issuing recommendations about future UTM deployments, regulations and standards.. The PODIUM project published its conclusions and recommendations in Nov. 2019. They can be found here.
