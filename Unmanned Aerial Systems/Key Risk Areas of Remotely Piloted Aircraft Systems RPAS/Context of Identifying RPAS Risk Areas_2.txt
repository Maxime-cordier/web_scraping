level sufficient to override RPAS control-link signals.. Non-compliance with RPAS regulations — Except for situations in which RPICs are allowed to violate/supersede regulations to resolve an emergency, remote pilots are presumed to be compliant. Reports of accidents and serious incidents sometimes show, however, patterns of behavior that disrupt the safety nets designed to enable RPAS–manned aircraft integration into controlled airspace.. Careless or reckless RPA flight that endangers the lives or property of other people — Comprehensive public education about personal responsibility for “drone safety” and free tools such as smartphone apps have aimed to curtail actual near misses between RPAs flown by amateur pilots and commercial air transport aircraft. Other measures have included: collision-prevention features engineered into current RPA models; clear restrictions and requirements by NAAs on people who fly RPAs for various purposes (especially in commercial and professional settings); government registration of all RPAs; and, similar risk mitigations have been implemented in many countries to reduce the incidence of such threatening behaviour.. collision-prevention features engineered into current RPA models;. clear restrictions and requirements by NAAs on people who fly RPAs for various purposes (especially in commercial and professional settings);. government registration of all RPAs; and,. similar risk mitigations have been implemented in many countries to reduce the incidence of such threatening behaviour..
