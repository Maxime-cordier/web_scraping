The FAA issued its Remote ID Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on 31 December 2019 which detailed the technical requirements for Remote ID on unmanned aircraft systems operation in the United States. During the 60-day public comment period, the FAA received more than 53,000 comments on the proposed rule. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on 15 Jan. 2021, with an original effective date of 16 March 2021. Corrections made to the rule and published in the Federal Register delayed the effective date to 21 April 2021. Changes included, for example, shortened manufacturer/operator compliance dates compared with the NPRM and the simpler opportunity for operators of non-standard remote ID drones to obtain a remote ID broadcast module and to retrofit the module to multiple drones that have the same registration number. In the FAAâ€™s final rule, drone pilots have the following choices: Operate a standard remote ID drone, as noted, with built-in capability to broadcast its identification and location information about the drone and its control station/take-off point;. Operate a drone with a remote ID broadcast module, as noted, providing the add-on flexibility. Note: The remote pilots and other persons responsible must be able to see their drone at all times during flight; or,. Operate a drone without remote ID equipment only at FAA-recognized identification areas (FRIAs) sponsored by community-based organizations or educational institutions..
