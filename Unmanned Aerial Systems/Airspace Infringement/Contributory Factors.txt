Poorly equipped aircraft (navigation and communication equipment).. Inexperienced, inadequately trained or poorly performing pilots.. Poor pre-flight preparation (out-of-date or inappropriate maps, NOTAM briefing, etc.).. Over-reliance on GPS equipment or failure to use it effectively. Adverse weather.. Airspace and Procedure Design which constrains uncontrolled air traffic into corridors of limited horizontal and/or vertical dimension.. Unfavourable attitude of air traffic controllers to VFR flights, leading to poor comumnication.. Routine (assumption that airspace restrictions on a familiar route will not change) or Complacency..
