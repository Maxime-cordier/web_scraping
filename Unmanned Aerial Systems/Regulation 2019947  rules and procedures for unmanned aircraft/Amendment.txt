The first amendment to this Regulation was made by Regulation 2020/639. The most common changes are summarized as follows: Added 11 new definitions. Added a provision for cross-border operations for LUC certificate holders as well as an applicability date of that provision (02.12.2021). Until that date Member States may accept declarations made by UAS operators based on national standard scenarios. Such declarations shall cease to be valid from 02.12.2023.. In order to improve the conspicuity of UAS flown at night and make it easily distinguishable from a manned aircraft, a green flashing light should be activated on the UAS. This requirement is applicable from 01.07.2022. The responsibilities of the UAS operator in the "specific" category with respect to record keeping are desrcribed in more detail. These include records for personnel, their qualification and the UAS operations performed, including unusual technical or operational occurrences.. Added 2 standard scenarios for UAS operations in the "specific" category (Appendix 1 to the Annex): STS-01 – VLOS (visual line of sight) over a controlled ground area in a populated environment STS-02 – BVLOS (beyond VLOS) with Airspace Observers over a controlled ground area in a sparsely populated environment. STS-01 – VLOS (visual line of sight) over a controlled ground area in a populated environment. STS-02 – BVLOS (beyond VLOS) with Airspace Observers over a controlled ground area in a sparsely populated environment. Details about the scenarios may be found in Regulation 2020/639 and the consolidated version of this Regulation. The second amendment to this Regulation was made by Regulation 2020/746. Recognizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry as a whole and on the emerging UAS field in particular, the following dates are postponed by six months: Some UAS types are allowed to continue to be operated if they have been placed on the market before 01.07.2022 (now 01.01.2023).. Deadlines for adaptation of authorisations, declarations and certificates.. The transitional period for UAS in the "open" category which do not comply with the requirements of Regulation 2019/945 is extended from 2 years to 30 months.. The applicability of Regulation 2019/947 is postponed to 31.12.2020.. The deadlines for making information on UAS geographical zones publicly available (and in a common unique digital format) is extended to 01.01.2022.. The third amendment to this Regulation was made by Regulation 2021/1166. It was recognized that some of the harmonised standards addressing the requirements applicable to UAS of classes C5 and C6 will not be available as expected (by 2.12.2021) and therefore, some application dates were postponed. The fourth amendment to this Regulation was made by Regulation 2022/425. It was recognized that some of the harmonised standards addressing the requirements applicable to UAS of classes C0 to C6 necessary to operate in the ‘open’ category or under the standard scenarios, as well as the direct remote identification would not be available until mid-2023. Therefore, relevant dates need to be postponed. A consolidated version of this Regulation is available here (includes the first three amendments).
