This article briefly describes the principal air traffic control (ATC) safety nets relevant to operation of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), including examples of relevant priorities of air navigation service providers (ANSPs). The article’s examples focus on regions or States other than the European Union and the United States to reflect today’s worldwide interest among aviation safety professionals. The article aims to encourage understanding of factors that determine when ATC safety nets protect or do not protect different categories of drones. Another intent is to point out that a number of experts contend that ATC safety nets — an operational necessity for manned-aviation industry sector for at least 20 years — now should be regarded similarly by unmanned-aviation stakeholders, where applicable. The article includes examples of ATC safety nets being cited essentially as “backup systems” to normal risk mitigations in civilian drone flight operations — in a similar manner as protecting manned aircraft. EUROCONTROL has advocated ATC safety nets for 20 years for manned aviation, and now also aims to optimise safety of RPAS flights.
