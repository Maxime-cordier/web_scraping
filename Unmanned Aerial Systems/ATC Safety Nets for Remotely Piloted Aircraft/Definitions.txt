The following definitions come from ICAO’s March 2017 concept of operations (CONOPS) that focuses entirely on future international RPAS flights, beyond visual line of sight under instrument flight rules (IFR). ATC safety net — In describing ATC safety nets, ICAO said, “Safety nets monitor aspects of the operational environment and generate an alert if a safety risk exists or remedial action is necessary to assure flight safety. They comprise: (a) those installed in the aircraft for use by flight crew and/or the aircraft itself, for example, an airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS); and, (b) those deployed in ground-based systems, such as those used by air traffic controllers — for example, short term conflict alert (STCA) [and] minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW). … Safety nets are designed to serve as a last line of defence and are not intended to replace conventional systems, such as for surveillance.”. Remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) — An unmanned aircraft piloted from a remote pilot station. (ICAO currently considers RPAS as a subset of UAS, meaning unmanned aircraft systems of all types; UAS includes RPAS, autonomous aircraft and model aircraft.) In its latest publications, ICAO applies the term RPAS for UAS that operate under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) or will do so in the future. ICAO working groups and other stakeholders also use the word drone to refer to small UAS that will operate below 500 ft, remotely-piloted or otherwise, by compliance with newly approved UAS traffic management (UTM) services operated by private entities..
