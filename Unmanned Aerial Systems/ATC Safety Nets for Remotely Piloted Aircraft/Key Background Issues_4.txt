The ICAO Surveillance Panel, given these uncertainties, also proposed to advise ICAO member states to conduct their own RF spectrum–congestion analyses “to determine how RPAS operations might impact the performance of ANSP surveillance systems” and then “to consider whether or not to prohibit such equipage, and under what circumstances. … “States should consider the degree to which the operation of RPAS may or may not require air traffic services as defined by ICAO. For example, if RPAS are operating in uncontrolled airspace, then the use of ICAO-compliant aeronautical surveillance equipment by RPAS may not be justified.” Similarly, if RPAs are not operating near manned aircraft “the use of ICAO-compliant aeronautical surveillance equipment by RPAS may not be justified.” RPAS in ICAO block upgrades — Other developments likely to influence ATC safety nets are one step to initially integrate RPAs into non-segregated airspace, and another step to implement procedures to operate RPAs in non-segregated airspace. In The Aviation System Block Upgrades: The Framework for Global Harmonization — finalized by ICAO in July 2016, the first step “implements refined operational procedures that cover lost command and control (C2) link (including a unique squawk code for lost C2 link), as well as enhanced detect and avoid technology.” The second step implements transparent management of RPAS by “continuing to improve the certification process for RPAs to operate on the aerodrome surface and in non-segregated airspace just like any other aircraft.”. Airborne collision avoidance aboard drones — ACAS Xu and ACAS sXu are two versions of the airborne collision avoidance system as parts of the multipurpose ACAS X generation. ACAS Xu and ACAS sXu have been designed for installation in RPAs and small UAs, respectively. As of August 2019, all ACAS X versions awaited issuance of ICAO standards and recommended practices..
