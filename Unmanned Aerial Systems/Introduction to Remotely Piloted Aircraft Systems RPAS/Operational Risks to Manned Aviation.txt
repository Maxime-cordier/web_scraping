To enable routinely flying missions mentioned in the preceding section, regulatory authorities had to mitigate risks of collision with other aircraft (manned and unmanned) and mitigate the risks of a small RA striking people on the ground. (Privacy-protection issues are beyond the scope of this article.) Legacy rules enabled small RPAS flights only in permanently or temporarily segregated airspace, with access by manned aircraft excluded or strictly controlled. The need for sense-and-avoid technology was delayed under older rules. Current concepts of operation presume that to operate in non-segregated airspace, small RPAS will operate at least at an equivalent level of risk to that which manned aircraft experience. In the United Kingdom, U.K. CAA-approved remote-pilot training requirements and schools that conduct approved courses have enabled people with no prior experience in piloting manned aircraft to qualify to fly RAs. Several other countries began adopting this qualification system in 2015.
