Research scientists have performed a comparison of RPAS-related philosophies and regulations across 56 nations. Their stated purpose was to inform subject matter experts’ perspectives of the global state of RPAS risk management and to benefit NAAs and other stakeholders. Over time, SKYbrary anticipates adding articles to the RPAS Category, reporting on regulatory and guidance philosophies implemented by NAAs in several states and regions. At present, such viewpoints are briefly described in UAS Rules and Guidance - EU and UAS Rules and Guidance - USA. For example, FAA in mid-2018 emphasized in public conferences the degree of risk analysis and management required in safety cases presented by RPAS operators seeking operational waivers as described in the above “Civil Applications of RPAS” section. FAA also explained its focus on promoting rapid development of the small-UAS industry (especially small RPAS) through close government-industry collaboration, while requiring every operator-applicant for waivers and/or airspace authorizations to prove its safety case with strong evidence of effective mitigations and logical arguments. Meanwhile, in the European Union, the Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems (JARUS) received European Commission approval of proposed changes to safety regulatory oversight of RPAS and airworthiness of RAs. JARUS since 2007 has pursued “a single set of technical, safety and operational requirements for the certification and safe integration of UAS into airspace and at aerodromes” — with cross-border harmonisation and minimal duplication of NAA effort. Currently, 35 states, including several non-European states such as China, the Russian Federation and the United States, are involved in JARUS initiatives. JARUS also has influenced international research into the next-generation airborne collision avoidance technology known as ACAS X.
