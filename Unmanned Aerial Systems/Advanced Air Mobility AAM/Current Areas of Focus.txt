According to a March 2019 study of UAM innovators, 100 UAM projects worldwide reflect significant progress by a diverse community of competitors and investors. The competitors comprise aviation-related companies and non-aviation-related companies that expect to apply RPAS capabilities to address complex transportation needs already identified by the world’s cities. As noted, urban “commercial passenger drone services” have been widely touted, and often characterized as imminent, by news media. For example, Roland Berger LLC said, “Manufacturers of airplanes, helicopters and vehicles are represented, alongside mobility and delivery service providers. But there are also plenty of non-industry players involved, such as consumer goods producers, pharmaceutical companies, telecommunications firms, research institutes, as well as city authorities, nations and supranational entities. … The ecosystem is complex, and the challenges in urban air mobility projects are extensive.” The consultancy’s interactive world map of UAM project sites specifically focuses on “projects that primarily target the use of autonomous drones to transport passengers, goods/parcels/mail and medication/first aid supplies around urban areas.”
