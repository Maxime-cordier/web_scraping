UAM or AAM missions would rely on precise navigation and timing through three-dimensional corridors of uncontrolled airspace. The benefits envisioned include high-speed transport, avoidance of motor vehicle traffic, and reduction of traffic congestion on streets, freeways and highways. Local flights will comprise a flight starting from a single point and extending out about 50 miles and back. Intraregional flights will be longer flights, such as between cities. Roland Berger LLC, a consultancy based in Germany, expects to see electric propulsion systems on most UAM aircraft. The firmâ€™s initial prediction of UAM-suitable RPA types includes the following designs: quadcopters, multicopters (distributed-propulsion and coaxial multirotor), hybrid-propulsion, tilt-wing/convertible-aircraft, fixed-wing vectored thrust and electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) types. This consultancy concentrated its research on the following UAM segments in 2018 and 2019: passenger transport; package/cargo delivery (e-commerce transport); emergency medical transport and security-related operations; aerial inspection and motor vehicle traffic control; and research, development and testing of UAM aircraft, systems and safety.
