The DINOS WG is a subgroup of the EUROCONTROL Operational Safety Group (SAFOPS). The DINOS WG was created after a dedicated SAFOPS session about Drones and the safety impact on manned aviation, that identified the need for a working group looking at the safety impact of unauthorized drones to the network (on/in the vicinity of airports and en-route). The DINOS WG is part of the work done under the EU implementing regulation 2019/123:“Identify operational safety hazards at network level in cooperation with operational stakeholders and assess the associated network safety risk and report them to the Agency”.
