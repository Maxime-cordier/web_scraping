flown close to a tower adjacent to the construction site. Based on the view that the RP had on the controller monitor, he determined that the UA was between the tower and the steel structure he was taking footage of, but he had not accounted for the adjustment he had made for taking the HQ video footage. This positioned the aircraft further away from the subject than it appeared. The RP continued to complete the tracking manoeuvre, during which the aircraft collided with the tower causing the UA to fall to a gantry platform approximately 20 m below. There were no injuries. As a result of this accident the operator has introduced measures to help prevent reoccurrences. This includes using propeller guards when operating in areas with possible obstructions and when flying with avoidance sensors switched off. The operator has also introduced a requirement that all RPs create a virtual fence for each flying site within which the UA can operate safely.
