This article primarily describes how the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the U.K. Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB) conduct investigations of accidents and serious incidents involving diverse causal factors for small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). The popular term drone is used interchangeably with sUAS in this article. Rules, methods and discretionary decisions implemented by aircraft accident investigation bodies like these influence their selection of which reported occurrences to investigate. Investigatorsâ€™ decisions also how they aim to benefit drone operators, regulators, air navigation service providers and human bystanders. Each final report published is a value statement about the high significance of deploying limited investigation assets this way. Two occurrences involving larger/heavier, remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) are detailed near at the end of the article.
