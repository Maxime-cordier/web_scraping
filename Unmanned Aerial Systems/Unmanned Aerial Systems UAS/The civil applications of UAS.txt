The recent rapid progress in extending the scope of military and State use of UAS has led to recognition of the very widespread potential for civil commercial applications of various UAS, the majority of which are small UAVs operating below the height above terrain normally used by manned aircraft or at least below about 1000 feet agl. Many of these uses are now well established and include: Security surveillance. Emergency response including SAR. Facilitation of communications and broadcast. Small package and bulk cargo transport. Visual, spectral and thermal examination of structures. Monitoring of linear network infrastructure such as railway tracks, power lines and pipelines. Photography and cartographic survey. Agricultural fertiliser and chemical application. Aircraft external maintenance inspection. Atmospheric research.
