An Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) has three components: An autonomous or human-operated control system which is usually on the ground or a ship but may be on another airborne platform;. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV);. A command and control (C2) system - sometimes referred to as a communication, command and control (C3) system - to link the two.. These systems include, but are not limited to, remotely piloted air systems (RPAS) in which the UAV is controlled by a 'pilot' using a radio data link from a remote location. UAS can also include an autonomously controlled UAV or, more likely, a semi autonomous UAV. In recent years, the tendency to refer to any UAV as a "drone" has developed but the term is not universally considered appropriate. UAVs can vary in size from those which can be hand launched to purpose built or adapted vehicles the size of conventional fixed or rotary wing aircraft.
