Both System/Component Failure Powerplant and Non-Powerplant are potential outcome types and therefore would be included in the UAS key risk areas. For the purpose of the safety risk portfolio analysis these safety events are assigned to two areas. The first one is Engine Failure, which covers failures of the UAS propulsion system. The second one is Other System Failures, which includes both electrical and control systems as well as software and data link failures.
