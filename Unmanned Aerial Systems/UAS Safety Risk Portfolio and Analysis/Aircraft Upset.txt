The second key risk identified by occurrence category analysis is Aircraft Upset, which covers the full range of Loss of Control situations. Whilst UAS upsets (Loss of Control) are different than those involving manned aircraft because there is no risk to persons on board the aircraft, there is a potential for injuries to people on the ground depending on the planning of the flight and the reversion modes of the UAS following a technical failure. Loss of control is particularly relevant for UAS as they are likely to operate in closer proximity to the ground than other types of air vehicles.
