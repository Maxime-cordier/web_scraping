The fifth key risk area covers the risk of UAS conflicts (collisions) with people or property (i.e. not involving aircraft) where they may cause injuries or damage. There were no occurrences involving such damage or injuries reported but scenario based risk assessment has identified this as a potential outcome that should be included as a key risk area for UAS operations. It is known that accidents involving UAS colliding with people on ground do happen, indeed such an event happened in the USA involving an UAS being used for media filming. However, none have been formally reported within the EASA member states. As the UAS industry is relatively new it could be possible that injuries due to drones are simply not reported on aviation level, but are only reported in hospitals where the injuries are treated or at local law enforcement level.
