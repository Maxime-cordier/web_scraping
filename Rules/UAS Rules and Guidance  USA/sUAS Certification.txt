A person operating an sUAS for purposes of flight must comply with the FAA aircraft-registration provisions in Part 91.203(a)(2), “Registration.” An sUAS pilot operating under Part 107 is responsible for ensuring the aircraft/system is safe before flying. The remote pilot in command has to perform a preflight visual and operational check of the small UAS to ensure that safety-pertinent systems are functioning properly. This includes checking the control link between the control station and the sUAS aircraft. The FAA does not require an sUAS aircraft to comply with current agency airworthiness standards or to obtain aircraft certification. As of 2021, only the flight above–human beings amendment that created Category 4 operations, has such requirements. Specifically, Category 4 rules state that the remote pilot in command of an sUAS: Must use a small unmanned aircraft that is eligible for Category 4 operations pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section; and,. Must operate the small unmanned aircraft in accordance with all operating limitations that apply to the small unmanned aircraft, as specified by the FAA.. Category 4 also states that the sUAS must: Have an airworthiness certificate issued under Part 21 of this chapter;. Be operated in accordance with the operating limitations specified in the approved Flight Manual or as otherwise specified by the FAA. The operating limitations must not prohibit operations over human beings; and,. Have maintenance, preventive maintenance, alterations, or inspections performed in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and maintain all records as specified..
