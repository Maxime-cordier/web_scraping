This Regulation is the next step towards progressive extension of the tasks of the European Aviation Safety Agency (European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)), with a view towards a ‘total system approach’, to aerodrome/airport safety and interoperability, air navigation services (ANS) and air traffic management (ATM). The Regulation is an important component of the second package of Single European Sky legislation that became popular under the heading Single European Sky II.
