This Regulation entered into force on 14-th December 2009. It repealed Directive 2006/23/EC on community air traffic controller licence. However, the provisions of the Directive continued to apply until Commission Regulation (EU) No 805/2011 laying down detailed rules for air traffic controllersâ€™ licences and certain certificates, referred to above, came into force in September 2011. Regulation 805/2011 was, in turn, repealed by Regulation 2015/340 Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 in the field of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services (OJ, 24.11.2009)
