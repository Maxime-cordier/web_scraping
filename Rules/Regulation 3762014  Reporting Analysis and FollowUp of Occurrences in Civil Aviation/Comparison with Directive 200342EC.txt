Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 and its Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1018 repeal Directive 2003/42/EC. As compared with the repealed Directive, the currently applicable regulations provide for new requirements. In Directive 2003/42/EC the implementation of voluntary reporting systems was not mandatory, whereas instead this requirement has mandatory character in Regulation (EU) No 376/2014. EASA, referred to as ‘Agency’ in Regulation (EU) No 376/2014, was not required to be involved in the collection and transfer of mandatory and voluntary reports in Directive 2003/42/EC, whereas instead it now is the recipient of the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 376/2014. The organisation of the list of classifying occurrences in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1018 to be reported under mandatory reporting schemes differs significantly from that of the list of occurrences reported in Directive 2003/42/EC. Notably Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1018 includes as classifying occurrences those related to aircraft other than complex motor-powered aircraft, including sailplanes and lighter-than-air vehicles, which Directive 2003/42/EC did not include within scope.
