Reporting, analysis and follow-up of occurrences in civil aviation is currently regulated in Europe by two main regulations: Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1018. Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council was adopted on 3 April 2014 and it deals with the reporting, analysis and follow-up of occurrences in civil aviation. The regulation also amends Regulation (EU) No 996/2010 on the investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation and repeals Directive 2003/42/EC on occurrence reporting in civil aviation and Commission regulations (EC) No 1321/2007 and (EC) No 1330/2007. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1018 of 29 June 2015 lays down a list classifying occurrences in civil aviation to be mandatorily reported according to Regulation (EU) No 376/2014.
