Article 17 of the ‘Basic Regulation’ instructs the Agency to assist the European Commission (EC) by “…preparing measures to be taken for the implementation of the [Basic] Regulation”. These measures include the preparation of draft Implementing Rules (IR’s) which are submitted to the EC (under Article 18) in the form of EASA opinions. Except for draft legislation, EASA are also empowered to issue opinions on a range of other technical and operational issues.

In these fields, interim provisions are established through adoption of Joint Aviation Requirements developed by the JAA. In addition, following the expansion of the scope of EASA’s role to the safety regulation of airport operations and air traffic control services new IR’s are being established in this field, in conjunction with the Community legislation established for the implementation of the Single European Sky (SES).
