The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is an agency of the European Union, established in 2002, whose regulatory role encompasses the airworthiness and environmental compatibility of aeronautical products, parts and appliances, flight-crew licensing and air operations and regulation of third country aircraft from a safety and environmental viewpoint as well as safety of ATM/ANS and aerodrome operation. EASA’s legal powers derive from its ‘Basic Regulation’ - Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 of 21 October 2009. The amended ‘Basic Regulation’ defines the Agency’s roles and responsibilities, and establishes common rules in the field of civil aviation. EASA undertakes its role through the application of a wide range of regulatory provisions which expand upon and interpret the requirements of the ‘Basic Regulation’ in a manner that provides sufficient technical detail and guidance to be applicable, as appropriate, by the Agency, its Member States and their National Aviation Authorities (NAAs).
