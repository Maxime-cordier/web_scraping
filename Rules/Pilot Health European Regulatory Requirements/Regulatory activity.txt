Out of the recognition that pilot mental health can significantly impair flight safety, as well as the issues identified by the EASA-led Germanwings task force, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published two opinion documents following industry consultation. These are Opinion 09/2016 and Opinion 14/2016 amending respectively the European air operations (AIR OPS) and aircrew regulations (AIR CREW). Opinion 14/2016 was voted by the European Parliament in 2018 as Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/1042 and it will apply from 14 August 2020. Opinion 09/2016 is currently still pending.
