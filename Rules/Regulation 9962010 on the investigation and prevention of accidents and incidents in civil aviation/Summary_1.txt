The Regulation applies to safety investigations into accidents and serious incidents: which have occurred in the territories of the EU Member States;. which have occurred outside the territories of the EU Member States, but involve aircraft registered in a Member State or operated by an undertaking established in a Member State;. in which a EU Member State is entitled to appoint an accredited representative to participate in the investigation;. in which a EU Member State (having a special interest by virtue of fatalities or serious injuries to its citizens) is permitted by the State conducting the investigation to appoint an expert.. The Regulation does not apply to safety investigations into accidents and serious incidents which involve aircraft engaged in military, customs, police or similar services. Each EU Member State shall appoint a national civil aviation safety investigation authority (SIA). The SIA shall be given sufficient resources and budget to conduct full safety investigations and be independent of other aviation authorities (e.g. certification authorities, airworthiness authorities, etc), and of any other party or entity, the interests of which could influence its objectivity. The SIA remit may be extended to include gathering and analysis of aviation safety related information, in particular for accident prevention purposes. A safety review shall be published annually at national level in order to inform the public of the general aviation safety level. Safety investigation authorities shall establish a European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities (the Network), composed of the heads of the SIA in each of the EU States. The Network shall seek to improve the quality of investigations conducted by SIAs and to strengthen their independence. In particular, it shall encourage high standards in investigation methods and investigator training; provide advice to regulatory bodies; promote best safety investigation practices and facilitate cooperation between the SIAs.

Safety investigation authorities may decide to investigate also other accidents, serious incidents or incidents when they expect to draw safety lessons from them. A SIA shall notify without delay the European Commission, European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the International Civil Aviation Organisation (International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)), the EU States and third countries concerned in accordance with the international SARPS of the occurrence of all accidents and serious incidents of which it has been notified.
