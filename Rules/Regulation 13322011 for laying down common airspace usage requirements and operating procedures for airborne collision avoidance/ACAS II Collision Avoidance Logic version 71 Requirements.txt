1. The following turbine-powered aeroplanes shall be equipped with collision avoidance logic version 7.1 of ACAS II: 2. The above requirement shall not apply to unmanned aircraft systems. 3. Aircraft not referred to in (1) above, but which will be equipped on a voluntary basis with ACAS II, shall have collision avoidance logic version 7.1. ACAS II shall be used during flight, except as provided in the minimum equipment list as specified in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91, in a mode that enables RA indications to be produced for the flight crew when undue proximity to another aircraft is detected, unless inhibition of RA indication mode (using TA indication only or equivalent) is called for by an abnormal procedure or due to performance limiting conditions. When an RA indication is produced by ACAS II: (a) the pilot flying shall immediately conform to the indications of the RA indication, even if this conflicts with an air traffic control (ATC) instruction, unless doing so would jeopardise the safety of the aircraft; (b) the flight crew, as soon as permitted by workload, shall notify the appropriate ATC unit of any RA which requires a deviation from the current ATC instruction or clearance; (c) when the conflict is resolved, the aircraft shall: (i) be promptly returned to the terms of the acknowledged ATC instruction or clearance and ATC notified of the manoeuvre; or (ii) comply with any amended ATC clearance or instruction issued. Operators shall establish ACAS II operational procedures and training programmes so that flight crews are appropriately trained in the avoidance of collisions and competent in the use of ACAS II equipment.
