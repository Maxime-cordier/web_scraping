Vigilance, especially on the part of the ground crew, is required during pushback and start procedures. Shallow fog reduces visibility and may obscure low profile ground support equipment, such as belt loaders, or items such as misplaced chocks or luggage items which have fallen from baggage carts, all of which create potential pushback hazards. The fog will also obscure the vision of those personnel operating support equipment on other areas of the apron and may diminish their situational awareness. The potential for collision is increased and should be mitigated with strict adherence to established pushback procedures. Taxiing in reduced visibility conditions can be challenging and the potential for a missed turn or a runway incursion is increased. Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) may be in force requiring appropriate crew training and specific authorisation from their National Aviation Authority (NAA). Specified, departure runway dependent, taxi routings, which at some aerodromes are issued by an alphanumeric route designator, may be in use. A thorough briefing of that expected route should take place prior to initiating taxi. Both pilots should be "heads up" during the taxi and actively monitor their position on the aerodrome against the appropriate chart or by electronic means. Wherever possible, checklists should be accomplished with the aircraft stationary.
