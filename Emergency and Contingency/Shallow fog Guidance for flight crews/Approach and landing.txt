For most modern commercial transport aircraft equipped with auto-land, low visibility at the destination does not preclude a safe landing at an aerodrome equipped with an appropriate category Instrument Landing System (ILS). However, for non auto-land capable business and commercial aircraft, and for general aviation, shallow fog can represent a significant hazard. When approaching overhead, it might appear that there is no fog or that it is more patchy than forecast; ask for an update on the Runway Visual Range (RVR). Note that whilst RVR will normally provide a good indication of actual visibility, in the case of shallow fog, the readings may be misleading. Transmissometers, dependent upon the type and installation, are typically mounted at the top of poles ranging from approximately 2.5 to 4 meters in height. This can result in the sensor actually being above the most significant portion of the shallow fog layer. Since any shallow fog will be encountered in the flare, brief for a missed approach from that point. Note that a go-around from the flare, often termed a baulked landing or low energy go around, is a high risk manoeuvre. Some NAA's define the parameters for a baulked landing as: and consider it a mandatory training/testing item in all recurrent training. Depending upon the aircraft and engine type, and the landing weight, a go-around from the flare may require a modified flight profile to ensure that it can be accomplished safely. Note that touchdown may occur during the go-around process. Most jet engines must be allowed time to "spool up" before they begin to produce thrust and airspeed should be increasing prior to retracting flaps to the go-around position or initiating climb. Consider also that any missed approach will commence below the usual decision height for the runway in use and there may be obstacle clearance considerations in the go-around - this is especially important in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) or at night.
