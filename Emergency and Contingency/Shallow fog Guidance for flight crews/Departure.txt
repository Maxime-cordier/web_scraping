Shallow fog at the departure aerodrome can present some unique challenges. As the pilot eye height, whilst on the ground in most commercial aircraft, is greater than 2 meters, level and upwards visibility might well not be affected. However, objects below eye level, inclusive of signage and both taxiway and runway markings can be obscured. This will be even more pronounced if a low sun angle results in glare.
