The Planning activities may be organised as follows: Inventory of the Units/services/functions of an air navigation service provider (ANSP) - it is essential that the process be applied to the whole portfolio of air navigation service (ANS) units, services and functions (either provided or supplied). An inventory of resources (e.g. systems, procedures, and staff) should also be made.. Identification of “realistic events” - for each ANS unit, the “events” that may lead to loss or disruption of service or function should be identified. The likelihood of the events is to be considered to identify which ones are “realistic”.. Check if a plan already exists to manage the consequences of the “realistic events”. This question is the foundation of the contingency planning process.. Develop or change contingency measures - in this step, an ANSP should ensure first that safety and security requirements are met. Plan(s) should be developed to deal with “emergency” and “degraded modes” of operation. In addition, if there is a need to ensure service continuity, and if this is “viable” (in terms of policy/operational concept /economics), “service continuity” plan(s) might be developed.. For all plans, safety and security assessments should be conducted. The aim of this step is to ensure that the planned contingency measures meet safety and security requirements set at the Policy step.. For “service continuity” measures, an economic assessment of the viability of the plan would also be required since “business” considerations are likely to drive the development of such plan(s).. Develop measures for “recovery back to normal operations”.
