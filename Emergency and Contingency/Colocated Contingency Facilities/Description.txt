Contingency facilities can be developed on the same sites as the primary centres - e.g. training and test suites can be reassigned for contingency. Obsolete systems may also be used as a fallback facility. These applications can be retained on a 'care & maintenance' basis that enables ops teams to use them if the primary system fails; they could also provide considerable additional assurance during operations to 'clear the skies'. There are clear vulnerabilities for co-located systems that arise within particular European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) states. For instance, it can be difficult to identify appropriate sites that would not be vulnerable to seismic activity; similarly, for other air navigation service providers (ANSPs), co- located centres may create common vulnerabilities from threats such as flooding. For most service providers, there is a concern that primary and fallback facilities might both be affected by any future aviation accident if they were also both located close to an airport.
