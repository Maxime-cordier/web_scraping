the failure. As soon as it is known that an aircraft which is operating in its area of responsibility is experiencing an apparent RCF, an air traffic services unit shall forward information concerning the RCF to all air traffic services units concerned along the route of flight. The ACC in whose area the destination aerodrome is located shall take steps to obtain information on the alternate aerodrome(s) and other relevant information specified in the filed flight plan, if such information is not available. If circumstances indicate that a controlled flight experiencing a communication failure might proceed to (one of) the alternate aerodrome(s) specified in the filed flight plan, the air traffic control unit(s) serving the alternate aerodrome(s) and any other air traffic control units that might be affected by a possible diversion shall be informed of the circumstances of the failure and requested to attempt to establish communication with the aircraft at a time when the aircraft could possibly be within communication range. This shall apply particularly when, by agreement with the operator or a designated representative, a clearance has been transmitted blind to the aircraft concerned to proceed to an alternate aerodrome, or when meteorological conditions at the aerodrome of intended landing are such that a diversion to an alternate is considered likely. When an air traffic control unit receives information that an aircraft, after experiencing a communication failure has re-established communication or has landed, that unit shall inform the air traffic services unit in whose area the aircraft was operating at the time the failure occurred, and other air traffic services units concerned along the route of flight, giving necessary information for the continuation of control if the aircraft is continuing in flight.
