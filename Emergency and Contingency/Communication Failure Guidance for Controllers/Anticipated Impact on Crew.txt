A wide range of practical problems could arise following RCF: Crew may not be immediately aware of the communication loss;. Increased workload in the cockpit - crew must determine the time the RCF occurred and act accordingly by: attempting to establish radio telephony (RT) contact on the last frequency and other radio frequencies established for the flight route; attempting to establish RT contact with other aeronautical stations or aircraft or attempting to establish communication with the relevant ATC unit by any alternate available means; if RT contact cannot be established with the responsible ATC, the crew will follow procedures for RCF failure as described by their operational manual and all other applicable documents; adherence to the appropriate RCF emergency procedures depending on the flight conditions - VMC or IMC.. attempting to establish radio telephony (RT) contact on the last frequency and other radio frequencies established for the flight route;. attempting to establish RT contact with other aeronautical stations or aircraft or attempting to establish communication with the relevant ATC unit by any alternate available means;. if RT contact cannot be established with the responsible ATC, the crew will follow procedures for RCF failure as described by their operational manual and all other applicable documents;. adherence to the appropriate RCF emergency procedures depending on the flight conditions - VMC or IMC..
