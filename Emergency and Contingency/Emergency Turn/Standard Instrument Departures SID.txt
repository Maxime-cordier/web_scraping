Standard Instrument Departure (SID) routings are designed to allow efficient traffic flow, avoidance of noise sensitive areas and deconfliction from both arrival traffic and the traffic from other aerodromes. They also ensure obstacle clearance provided that the standard minimum climb gradient of 200'/nm (3.3%) or, when published, a specified higher climb gradient is met. The standard 3.3% SID gradient exceeds the certification requirements for engine out climb capability in virtually all transport category aircraft. Consequently, in the engine failure case, following the SID routing does not necessarily ensure obstacle clearance.
