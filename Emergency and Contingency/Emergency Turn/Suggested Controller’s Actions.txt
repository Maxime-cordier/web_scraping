Best practice embedded in the ASSIST principle could be followed (A - Acknowledge, S - Separate, S - Silence, I - Inform, S - Support, T - Time) : A - acknowledge the emergency and ask for the crew's intentions when their situation permits. Respect the “STANDBY” transmission and wait for the flight crew to indicate when they are able to provide further information. S - separate conflicting traffic from the emergency aircraft. This is particularly critical when an emergency turn requires the aircraft to deviate from its cleared routing. Prioritise it for landing and, when appropriate, keep the active runway clear of departures, arrivals and vehicles. S - silence the non-urgent calls (as required) and use separate frequency where possible. I - inform the airport emergency services and all concerned parties according to local procedures. S - support the flight experiencing the engine failure with any information requested or deemed necessary (e.g. type of approach, runway length and aerodrome details, etc.). T - provide time for the crew to assess the situation, don’t press with non-urgent matters. The controller should be prepared to: Acknowledge emergency on RTF. Take all necessary action to safeguard all aircraft concerned. Suggest a heading, if so required or requested. Provide separation or issue essential traffic information, as appropriate. Emergency broadcast if necessary. When the flight crew indicate they can accommodate further R/T communication, ask for pilot’s intentions and other important information, such as: Diversion Injuries Aircraft damage Fuel remaining Total passengers and crew. Diversion. Injuries. Aircraft damage. Fuel remaining. Total passengers and crew.
