Depending on the severity of the electrical failure(s) the consequences could be various, ranging from isolated system or subsystem malfunctions and navigational problems to failures having adverse effects on the aircraft's handling and performance. Historically, the electrical failures often result from interconnection breakdown between aircraft systems. For example, a problem with one system could lead to a bus bar failure potentially resulting in a complete or partial failure of an airplane's avionics system. An electrical problem may be the first indication of a fire. Modern jet transport aircraft are designed and equipped with at least three AC generators (alternators) of equivalent capacity, one of which will be powered by the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). There will also be other methods of generating AC power such as a hydraulically powered generator or a ram air generator and the ultimate backup of DC power from at least one main battery. If one of the principal (engine-powered) generators fails, the other generator(s) supply power to the main AC bus bars. In case of failure of more than one of the main generators or their associated motive power (or a single failure following an Acceptable Deferred Defect dispatch with an inoperative main generator or APU), it may be possible to use a hydraulic system to activate a hydraulic motor-driven emergency generator or to deploy Ram Air Turbine. Different aircraft manufacturers use different sources for back up AC power, e.g back up generators on the Boeing 777 and Ram Air Turbines (RAT) on Airbus types. In a worst case scenario, where these emergency/back up generators fail and the main battery, which has a declared endurance based on specified maximum electrical loading, is depleted, the aircraft becomes electrically unpowered. It is important to emphasize that a serious electrical problem can, under specific circumstances, constitute a high-risk scenario.
