If a call for a planted explosive device on board of an aircraft is received in the ATC unit, a calm response to the caller could help obtain additional information. This is especially true if the caller wishes to avoid injuries or deaths. If told that the airplane cannot land and be evacuated in time, the bomb threat caller may be willing to give more specific information on the bombâ€™s location, components, or methods of activation. The following general guidelines should be considered in such cases: Remain calm. Attempt to keep the caller on the line as long as possible. Ask him/her to repeat the message. Record every word spoken by the caller.. Record the flight number of the threatened aircraft, double check with the caller the flight number.. Ask for the exact location where bomb has been planted.. Get as much information as possible about the caller, e.g., vocal characteristic, race, gender, group affiliation, why the bomb was placed.. Try to capture clues from background noises, which might indicate caller's identification and location.. Immediately after the caller hangs up: Determine the location of the flight and, if necessary, contact the appropriate ATC unit if the flight is under control of another unit. Inform the ATCO controlling the subject flight; relay practical information if any was obtained from the caller (i.e. location of the bomb, components, or methods of activation). Report the threat according to local instructions (i.e. to your supervisor, the applicable law enforcement agency and the emergency response coordinator). Remain available, as law enforcement personnel will want to interview you..
