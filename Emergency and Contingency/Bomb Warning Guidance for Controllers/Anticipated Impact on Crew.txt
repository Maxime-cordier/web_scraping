A wide range of practical problems could arise following bomb warning: Increased workload in the cockpit - Upon receiving a threat for an explosive device on board, the flight crew normally assesses the situation and depending on the stage of flight and whereabouts of the aircraft, the crew makes a decision how to continue the flight.. Possible high level of stress - Although the flight crew can be expected to appear to remain calm, high levels of stress are normal and should be expected due to the nature of the contingency.. Possible communication problems - non standard RTF can be anticipated in the course of communications from the flight crew to ATC.. Decision for emergency evacuation - the flight crew may take the decision for emergency evacuation on the runway immediately upon landing.. Least Risk Bomb Location - If a specific suspect package is identified on board an aircraft, the aircraft commander may decide that it should be moved to the designated least risk bomb location, usually next to an external door in the rear galley.
