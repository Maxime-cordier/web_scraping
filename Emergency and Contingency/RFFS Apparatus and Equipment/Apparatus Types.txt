Aircraft fire fighting vehicles are divided into three categories: Rapid intervention vehicles - Rapid intervention vehicles can reach the accident site within a few minutes. They are very valuable for being able to attack the fires in their incipient stages and fires are often extinguished or controlled with such units prior to the arrival of larger fire fighting vehicles. Such vehicles are often capable of being operated by just one person.. Combined-agent vehicles - Combined-agent vehicles are capable of applying two different extinguishing agent simultaneously (e.g. foam and dry chemical) which gives them the ability to fight different types of fire simultaneously.. Major fire-fighting vehicles - Major fire fighting vehicles carry large quantities of water and foam concentrate and are capable of traversing rough terrain for off-runway operations.. Assuming that they are able to access the site, structural fire-fighting apparatus can also be used to fight aircraft fires with foam being the preferred suppression agent.
