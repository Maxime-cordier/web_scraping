In order to deploy the necessary amounts of fire extinguishing agents the vehicles are equipped with: Turrets - usually mounted on the tops of the cabins or on the front bumpers. They can be operated manually or remotely and usually can discharge the extinguishing agents in various patterns.. Handlines - usually used to extinguish interior fires or when the turrets cannot reach the flames.. Ground-sweep and undertruck nozzles - used to lay a blanket or path of foam in front of the vehicle so that it can move further without being endangered..
