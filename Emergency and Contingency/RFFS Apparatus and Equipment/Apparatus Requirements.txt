Some specific factors relevant to aircraft and airport fire fighting lead to specific requirements for the apparatus used for this purpose: An aircraft almost always carries some amount of fuel and/or lubricants so the danger of fire is virtually always present in an accident or incident.. Burning aircraft fuels rapidly produce very high temperatures.. Aircraft onboard fire fighting capabilities are very limited.. Hazardous cargo or large number of passengers can be in close proximity to large amounts of fuel.. Because of these factors, relevant regulations state the requirements that RFFS apparatus must be able to meet. The most important of these are: The ability to discharge adequate quantities of extinguishing agents within a short period of time. The precise requirements are prescribed in relevant documents (e.g. EASA AMC and GM in the EU, CAP 168 in the UK, Federal Aviation Regulation Standard 139.317 in the USA). The ability to operate effectively on both paved and unpaved areas. Airport RFF apparatus may need to be driven across terrain that would be difficult or impossible to transverse by typical structural fire apparatus..
