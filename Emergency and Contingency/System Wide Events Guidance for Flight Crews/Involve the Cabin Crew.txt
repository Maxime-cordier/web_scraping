Once sufficient information is available and a course of action decided then the cabin crew should be briefed with particular attention to the remaining flight time and other factors that may influence the cabin service. Ensure that announcements to the passengers are coordinated. In some circumstances it may be advisable to curtail the serving of alcoholic drinks and this should be discussed. Duty period limits may also need to be considered, particularly if an onward flight is planned.
