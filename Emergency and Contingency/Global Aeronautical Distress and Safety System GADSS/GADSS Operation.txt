The operational concept for GADSS implementation revolves around a cooperative relationship between ATS, the aircraft operator and Rescue Coordination Centres (RCC). The first two each have an active role and responsibility for tracking an aircraft in flight and will advise the third in the event that loss of position update is experienced or that ADT is activated. Similarly, if a search and rescue asset detects an emergency signal, such as an ELT from an aircraft, the affected RCC will notify ATC and the operator. RCC, ATS and the aircraft operator each have specific duties and responsibilities during each of the three defined ICAO Emergency Phases (Uncertainty Phase, Alert Phase and Distress Phase). For complete details of these responsibility relationships, refer to the GADSS Concept of Operations manual listed under Further Reading below.
