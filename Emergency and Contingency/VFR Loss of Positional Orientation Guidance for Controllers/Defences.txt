In general, to avoid the loss of visual terrain awareness, as a controller be proactive in the provision of assertive safety alert instructions, including the provision of the relevant minimum sector altitude to the affected aircraft. Provide prompt position information to an aircraft that has deviated from a cleared route, or whose observed position differs from the one being reported. Be aware that the flight crew can often be reluctant to declare a loss of orientation emergency. Personal Awareness - ATCOs should always be monitoring the course and altitude of traffic in his/her sector. Being constantly aware of any ongoing deviations should provide precious time for vectoring of nearby traffic.. Adequate Reaction - Some of the possible actions: transfer all other aircraft to another frequency (possibly message all stations to increase awareness); leave the emergency traffic on the current frequency; increase the volume of the receiver; use common sense; have a colleague (a second pair of ears) to also listen to all transmissions from the aircraft.. Technological Limitations - Try to keep the aircraft within radar cover. Keep in mind the features of the existing radar system.. Organisational Awareness - Training of ATCOs for efficient handling of emergency situations should be an objective at administrative level. Periodic training and drills are likely to improve intra-organisational coordination..
