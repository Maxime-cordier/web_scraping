Operational Supervisor’s (SUP) actions. The ATC shift supervisor should be able to mitigate the impact of severe weather avoidance by air traffic on the controller’s workload by facilitating and engaging in the following actions: Flow Management Position’s (FMP) actions. The FMP should provide the necessary assistance to the OPS Supervisor and facilitate the management of the severe weather by timely activation of coordinated flow control measures in order to prevent sector overloads. During the normalization period, special consideration must be given to possible bunching of traffic at the end of the regulated period. It is considered that return to normal capacity following flow control measures is usually more efficient if implemented on a gradual (step-by-step) basis. The FMP should consider passing timely information to regional flow management unit (NMOC for the European region) about the forecast and actual convective weather and its impact on ATC operations. Controllers’ actions. Controllers should exercise their best judgement and expertise when dealing with adverse weather avoidance scenarios; in particular they should be prepared to: Organisational measures.
