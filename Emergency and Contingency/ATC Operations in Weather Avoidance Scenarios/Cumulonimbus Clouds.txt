Convective clouds present a serious hazard to aviation. Aircraft entering a Cumulonimbus (Cb) cloud may experience severe turbulence, icing, lightning, precipitation (especially Hail), and strong winds (both vertical and horizontal). These hazards, individually and collectively can lead to structural damage, injuries to crew and passengers, loss of separation/level bust as a result of an inability to maintain assigned level, and loss of control. Where possible, flight crews will wish to avoid passing within 20 nm of a cumulonimbus cloud. Particularly intense Cbs, often associated with squall lines, may also present related phenomena such as Tornados, Gust Fronts, and Microbursts, all of which can have an impact on air traffic management and airport infrastructure. Aircraft equipped with Weather Radar are able to identify the areas of cloud with the greatest moisture content and navigate through (or if not possible, around) areas of convective activity. Controllers should note that flight crew workload increases significantly in a weather avoidance scenario not just because of the decision making associated with weather avoidance but also because of Turbulence, management of In-Flight Icing, and increased communications. Particularly dense cells, or groups of cells, can attenuate radar and radio signals thereby causing loss of radar contact and poor quality or lost communications.
