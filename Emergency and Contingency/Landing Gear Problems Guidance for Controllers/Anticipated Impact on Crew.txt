In case of a gear problem, the crew bears significant stress. They will need time to fully assess the nature of the problem. Further steps could include crew visual inspection (depending on aircraft design), alternate extension procedures which may include manual emergency landing gear extension, or flight manoeuvres designed to force the drop of the landing gear. All of these steps require significant preparation. It might be necessary to perform several low pass approaches in order for qualified technical personnel to inspect visually the landing gear status and position. A landing with confirmed unlocked gear could result in an emergency evacuation of the aircraft and the cabin crew will need to prepare the cabin and passengers for such an event.
