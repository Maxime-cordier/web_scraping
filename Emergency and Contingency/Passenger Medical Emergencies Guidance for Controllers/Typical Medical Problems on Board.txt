Researches show that inflight medical emergencies are rare, occurring at a rate of approximately 15 to 100 per million passengers, with a death rate of 0.1 to 1 per million. (Management of inflight medical emergencies on commercial airlines by M. Prout, J. Pine, see Further Reading). On the other hand, if a serious health problem occurs on board, the access to medical care is limited. While there is a plethora of medical issues that can arise during a flight, researches have shown that the most common problems are: Fainting;. Heart attack;. Dehydration;. Nausea / vomiting.. Not every medical problem leads to the flight crew declaring a medical emergency. In many cases the flight crew and/or other passengers (e.g. doctors, passengers with medical education and experience) are able to successfully resolve the situation.
