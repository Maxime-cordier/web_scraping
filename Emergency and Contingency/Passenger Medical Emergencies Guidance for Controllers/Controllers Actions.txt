The advice given in this section is derived from good practices and common sense and is neither to be considered exhaustive nor intended to replace local procedures. Generally, the ASSIST (A - acknowledge S - separate S - silence I - inform S- support T - time) routine should be followed, bearing in mind the specifics of the situation: Acknowledge the situation and clarify whether an emergency is being declared;. Obtaining as much information as necessary, e.g. number of sick passengers, the exact nature of the medical problem or, if the medical problem is not determined, the symptoms being manifested plus any other relevant details of the situation. Determine, as necessary, if the passenger illness is recognised as infectious (e.g. symptoms such as constant productive cough and signs of fever);. Clarify the intentions of the flight crew; most likely they will choose to land on the nearest suitable aerodrome;. Assist the flight crew by: Providing a shorter route to the aerodrome chosen; Providing information on the aerodrome chosen (if requested); Giving priority to the aircraft that has declared an emergency (e.g. issuing separation-related instructions to other aircraft); Coordinate appropriate services on arrival; Inform the supervisor. Outsourcing some of the workload (e.g. coordination with the aerodrome) could prove useful, especially in heavy traffic situations.. Providing a shorter route to the aerodrome chosen;.
