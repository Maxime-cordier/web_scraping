The terms "strayed" and "unidentified" are not mutually exclusive. An aircraft may be considered, at the same time, as "strayed" by one ATS unit and as "unidentified" by another one. For example, following a navigation system failure (or, in the case of a VFR flight, loss of positional orientation), an aicraft may, while in the airspace of one unit, stray and ultimately enter the airspace of another unit. The former unit will consider the aircraft to be strayed, and the latter would treat is as unidentified, at least until contact has been established. While different in nature, the two situations share two risk scenarios: Therefore, the presence of a strayed or unidentified aircraft is normally considered and abnormal situation and is dealt with accordingly. The focus of the air traffic controller remains on ensuring the safety of that flight and of the other traffic. To this end, the following actions are taken, as necessary: Note that the actions described above are in line with the ASSIST (Acknowledge, Separate, Silence, Inform, Support, Time) principle that normally outlines the controllers' response to an unusual or emergency situation. While some unidentified aircraft are strayed as well, this is not always the case. Reasons for an aicraft not being identified include (the list is not exhaustive): When a controller is informed that an unknown aircraft has entered their airspace, they would make every effort to establish contact and identify it, as specified in the local instructions. Example actions include: After the aircraft has been identified, the controller would inform the military authorities in accordance with local instructions.
