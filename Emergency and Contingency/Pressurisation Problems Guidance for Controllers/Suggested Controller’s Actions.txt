Best practice embedded in the ASSIST principle could be followed (A - Acknowledge; S - Separate, S - Silence; I - Inform, S - Support, T - Time) : A - acknowledge the decompression, ask for the crews’ intentions when their situation permits, and establish whether the crew is able to control the aircraft;. S - separate the aircraft from other traffic, prioritise it for landing (allow long final if requested), keep the active runway clear of departures, arrivals and vehicles;. S - silence the non-urgent calls (as required) and use separate frequency where possible;. I - inform the airport emergency services and all concerned parties according to local procedures, as a tower controller expect if the aircraft is to land as soon as possible, airport authorities execute a massive contingency plan. S - support the flight experiencing the consequences of the decompression with any information requested and deemed necessary (e.g. type of approach, runway length and aerodrome details, etc.);. T - provide time for the crew to assess the situation, don’t press with non urgent matters.. The controller should be prepared to: Acknowledge emergency on RTF. Take all necessary action to safeguard all aircraft concerned. Suggest a heading, if so required. State the minimum altitude, if necessary. Provide separation or issue essential traffic information, as appropriate. Emergency broadcast if necessary. After emergency descent and when the situation permits, ask for pilot’s intentions and other important information, such as: Diversion Injuries Aircraft damage. Diversion. Injuries. Aircraft damage. Consider aircraft still to be in an emergency situation - The aircraft could be ready to continue flight without any further complications after the emergency descent, if no structural damage was inflicted during decompression. However, often the crew is not able to assess during flight neither the exact type, nor the extent of the damage..
