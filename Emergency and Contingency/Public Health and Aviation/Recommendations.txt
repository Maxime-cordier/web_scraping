To address the above issues, the following three key components are essential for adequate preparedness planning: Multi-stakeholder involvement - relevant stakeholders should be involved prior to an event. In particular, the aviation sector stakeholders, including both operators and regulators, need to communicate, coordinate and collaborate with the public health sector, in advance of the next public health emergency. At governmental level this may require the support of both the Minister of Health and the Minister of Transport.. Initial actions in the event of a public health emergency or potential emergency should be well known by the key players. It is during the initial stages of an event, when accurate information is often lacking, that stakeholders need to quickly establish good communication channels. News releases should be coordinated to avoid inconsistencies. A pre-established network is fundamental to an efficient response.. Preparedness plans should be tested by table top or realistic scenarios.
