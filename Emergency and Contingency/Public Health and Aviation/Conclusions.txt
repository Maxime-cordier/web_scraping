Public health emergencies or potential emergencies are not new, but the increase in aviation activity in recent decades has made it more likely than before that air travel will promulgate the international spread of disease, and that aviation itself and the economies that rely on it will be affected on a wider scale. States should develop and test aviation related public health preparedness plans that are integrated with a State’s general preparedness plans. At a governmental level this will require communication and collaboration between the Ministries of Health and Transport, which experience has shown could be better developed. Coordination is also required at an inter-State level within regions and also globally, since public health threats are rarely limited by international borders. A harmonized approach, based on scientific best practice, is more likely to be effective and to instil confidence in the travelling public. Regional and international organizations have a major part to play in facilitating such coordination. ICAO has established links with WHO, ACI, IATA and other stakeholders and is working towards joint preparedness planning at a global and regional level. The CAPSCA programme is available to help States develop plans at a national and operational level. Good planning will help ensure that the response to the next public health emergency is timely and appropriate, will reduce the likelihood of inappropriate “knee-jerk” reactions and will promote a prompt return to normal operations when the threat to health has passed.
