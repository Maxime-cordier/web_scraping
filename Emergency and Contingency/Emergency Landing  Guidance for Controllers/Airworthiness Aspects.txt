A number of airworthiness measures have been developed to make emergency landings more survivable. These address the landing itself as well as the risks that arise after the aircraft has come to a stop, most notably the post-crash fire and aircraft sinking after a ditching. Occupant protection from deceleration forces, including protection from injuries caused by these forces on the aeroplaneâ€™s interior equipment.. Occupant protection from fire (e.g. use of non-combustible materials).. Facilities for rapid evacuation (e.g. emergency exits, evacuation slides, etc.), appropriate to the occupant capacity.. Ensuring safe evacuation in case of ditching (e.g. life vests and using evacuation slides as rafts)..
