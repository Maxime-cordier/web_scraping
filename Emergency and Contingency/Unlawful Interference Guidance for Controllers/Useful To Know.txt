Unlawful interference (aircraft hijacking) has been recognized as a considerable danger to the safety of aviation. The international community has witnessed the disastrous potential of such acts in a number of accidents. As early as 1969, the Tokyo Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed On Board Aircraft entered into force and was ratified by 185 countries. The act provided the pilot in command with some special powers to counteract the commitment of unlawful acts. Several other documents have come into force over subsequent years. As individuals or groups used aircraft hijacking to pursue political, economic or individual goals, so governments and the aviation industry upgraded security regulations and requirements. More recent incidents brought changes to aircraft design, some of which were publicly announced and others logically concealed from public view.
