Acts of unlawful interference do not follow any specific scenario - sometimes even the confirmation of that such action is in progress proves to be a challenge. The outcome and the effects might vary significantly depending on the situation: Hindered or complete loss of communication with the crew;. Immediate descent and landing, if cockpit security and safety of passengers is not affected;. Single or multiple, unannounced, flight path deviations - vertical/horizontal;. Diversion to an airport, not listed in the flight plan;. Possible on-board bomb threat;. Selective compliance to instructions;. Runway blockage after landing;. Medical help might be required..
