A plane crash is an unexpected and generally catastrophic event. Concern for people who have suffered distress and loss due to a plane crash has led to increased effort within the aviation industry to establish procedures to address the needs of victims and their families in a timely manner. Measures taken in response to an accident are crucial, not only in terms of emergency planning, but also from a consolidated family assistance perspective. Regardless of the magnitude of an accident, victims and their families must receive adequate assistance. Assistance programmes require cooperative planning and response by the aircraft operator, airport operator, the State of occurrence, non-governmental organisations and specialized commercial enterprises. Due to variations in the size and circumstances of air accidents, the scope of resources needed to provide family assistance will vary considerably. It is therefore necessary to plan these events to ensure that, in the event of a serious air accident, the assistance provided to victims and their families is adequate and sufficient.
