During its 32nd Session in October 1998, the ICAO Assembly considered the subject of assistance to aircraft accident victims and their families and adopted Resolution A32-7, which stated, among other things, that “the policy of ICAO should be to ensure that the mental, physical and spiritual well-being of victims involved in civil aviation accidents and their families are considered and accommodated by ICAO and its Contracting States.” Resolution A32-7 also said that “it is essential that support be provided to family members of victims of civil aviation accidents, wherever the accident may occur, and any lessons learnt from support providers, including effective procedures and policies, be promptly disseminated to other Contracting States and ICAO to improve States’ family support operations.” In 2001, in response to Resolution A32-7, ICAO issued Circular 285 Guidance on Assistance to Victims of Air Accidents and their Families, as the first step for many to take with regard to family assistance planning. Moreover, in ICAO Annex 13, Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation, it was strengthened to a standard the entitlement of States to appoint experts to visit States where the accident has occurred, have access to the relevant factual information on the progress of the investigation and receive a copy of the final report by the State conducting investigation. In 2005 provisions to enable expeditious entry of family members of the victims into the State in which the accident has occurred were inserted in ICAO Annex 9, Facilitation. During ICAO Assemblies 39 and 40, ICAO reaffirmed its commitment to family assistance subject urging and encouraging States that have legislation, regulations and/or policies to support civil aviation accident victims and their families to review these documents in consideration of the ICAO policy in Doc 9998 and of the guidance material in Doc 9973.
