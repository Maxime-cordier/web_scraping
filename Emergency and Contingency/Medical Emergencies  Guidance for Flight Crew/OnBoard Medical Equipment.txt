Regulations on what emergency equipment must be carried and what optional equipment can carried vary by National Aviation Authority. In all cases, one or more first aid kits (FAK) will be on the aircraft. These contain most of the items that might be required to deal with a non life threatening injury such as a burn, cut or broken bone. Cabin crew are fully trained in emergency first aid procedures. Therapeutic oxygen is also universally carried, normally in portable oxygen cylinders fitted with a regulator and mask. Cabin crew are trained to administer oxygen to passengers experiencing breathing difficulties or are manifesting other symptoms for which supplemental oxygen is appropriate. An Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is carried on board most commercial aircraft for heart related emergencies. Cabin crew are trained and qualified in the use of this equipment and are also trained and qualified in CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). A physician's kit or emergency medical kit, containing various drugs and both diagnostic and invasive medical instruments, is carried on board many commercial aircraft. Cabin crew are not trained or qualified to administer drugs and the contents of this kit can only be accessed and administered by a licensed medical practitioner, should one be on board. Typically, a physician's kit will contain some or all of the following (Source: Aerospace Medical Association): Medications Epinephrine 1:1,000 Antihistamine, injectable (inj.)
