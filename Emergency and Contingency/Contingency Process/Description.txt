Plan: Plan demonstrates how the aims of the set of Requirements that have evolved from the Policy and Operational Concept will be achieved. It also outlines the strategies/actions and resources required. The products of this step are the contingency plan(s).. Achievement: Achievement verifies that the detailed means for translating the plans into reality are effectively in place. It covers testing, exercising, maintaining and reviewing the various contingency plans and raising awareness of contingency within ANSPs.. Execution and Assurance: This step corresponds to the Execution of the contingency plan. It includes also the monitoring and recording activities to be undertaken to enable the Promotion.. Promotion: Contingency Planning Promotion ensures communication of the contingency culture, dissemination of lessons learnt and enables the continuous improvement of the process.. The arrows forming the loop indicate that Assurance and Promotion follow the Execution of the Contingency Plan and they should ensure that the Contingency Plan(s) are reviewed and continually improved.
