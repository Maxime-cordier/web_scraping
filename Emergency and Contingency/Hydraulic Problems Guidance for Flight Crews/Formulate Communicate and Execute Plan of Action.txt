Once the applicable secondary actions have been completed, pilots can determine their best course of action. The salient details of the plan should be transmitted to ATC and to Company Operations to enable co-ordination of any required support. ATC will need to know: diversion aerodrome, requested runway and intended approach.. distance at which the crew would like to join the final approach course.. If the aircraft will need to configure earlier than normal during approach and require non-standard speed control/vertical profile.. approach speed if it will be significantly higher than normal.. if the aircraft will be stopped on the runway.. if the aircraft will be able to vacate the runway under its own power.. Company Operations should also be advised so maintenance co-ordination (such as arrangements to tow the aircraft off of the runway) and commercial considerations (customs, passenger handling etc.) can be arranged.
