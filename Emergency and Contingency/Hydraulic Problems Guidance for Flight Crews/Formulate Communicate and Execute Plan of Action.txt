Once the applicable secondary actions have been completed, pilots can determine their best course of action. The salient details of the plan should be transmitted to ATC and to Company Operations to enable co-ordination of any required support. ATC will need to know: Company Operations should also be advised so maintenance co-ordination (such as arrangements to tow the aircraft off of the runway) and commercial considerations (customs, passenger handling etc.) can be arranged.
