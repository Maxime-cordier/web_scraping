Depending on the specific failure or the extent of damage to the hydraulic system(s), the following effects could result: Loss of control. Partial or complete loss of control over specific control surfaces. Loss of autopilot. Reversion to a degraded flight control law. Impact on/collateral damage to other systems (e.g. due to a ruptured hydraulic pipe). Possible loss of ETOPS and/or RVSM capability. Loss of low visibility landing capability due to degraded autopilot or flight controls. Difficulties with normal landing gear extension. Inability to retract landing gear. Inability to extend/retract high lift devices such as flaps or slats. Reduced braking capability upon landing. Loss of anti-skid systems. Inability to actuate thrust reversers. Loss of nosewheel steering.
