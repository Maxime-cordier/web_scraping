Hydraulic systems of some description are present on virtually all aircraft types. In a light or general aviation aircraft, the use of hydraulic power may be limited to the application of wheel brakes only. In larger and more complex aircraft multiple systems may be used to provide the ‘muscle’ to operate a wide variety of components and systems. For example, these could include primary and secondary flight controls, the landing gear, nosewheel steering, wheel brakes, thrust reversers and cargo doors. As the dependency upon hydraulic power increases, the integrity of the hydraulic systems becomes ever more critical to the safety of flight. Based on this hydraulic system criticality, many design features are incorporated to ensure reliability, redundancy and the ability to maintain control of the aircraft in the event of one or more failures. Often two or more hydraulic systems are built into the design of an aircraft. Each system is provided with different sources of fluid pressurization and power generation. This power is transmitted by the hydraulic fluid through system specific hydraulic lines and used to drive the motors and actuators associated with that system. While hydraulic systems may be designed to exchange power under controlled conditions via a Power Transfer Unit (PTU), there are very rarely provisions for any exchange of fluids incorporated into system designs.
