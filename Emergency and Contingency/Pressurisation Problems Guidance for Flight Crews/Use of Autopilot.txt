Crew coordination and communication are more difficult when wearing oxygen masks and a pilot's field of vision is reduced. Most operators therefore recommend the use of the autopilot for the emergency descent. Use of the autopilot frees up the crew to consider the implications of the emergency, run checklists, and coordinate with ATC. Furthermore, if you subsequently lose consciousness then the aircraft will stabilise at the new set altitude and you, or other members of the crew, will hopefully recover before the aircraft runs out of fuel. The specific detail on how to manage the autopilot in an emergency descent will, of course, be dependent on the capability of the autopilot and also be aircraft specific. However, the basic principles are the same: get the aircraft into a rapid descent to level off at a set altitude. For this reason, some operators caution against the use of the vertical speed mode.. Turn away from track i.e. out of the airway to reduce risk of loss of separation from other aircraft..
