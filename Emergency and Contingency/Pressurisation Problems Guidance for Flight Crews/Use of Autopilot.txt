Crew coordination and communication are more difficult when wearing oxygen masks and a pilot's field of vision is reduced. Most operators therefore recommend the use of the autopilot for the emergency descent. Use of the autopilot frees up the crew to consider the implications of the emergency, run checklists, and coordinate with ATC. Furthermore, if you subsequently lose consciousness then the aircraft will stabilise at the new set altitude and you, or other members of the crew, will hopefully recover before the aircraft runs out of fuel.
