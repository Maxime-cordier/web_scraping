The best profile to fly is idle thrust, speed brakes out, and speed as appropriate for the condition of the aircraft. For an aircraft with no structural damage, maximum operating speed (Mmo/Vmo) is generally considered the appropriate target. Don't use speed brakes if you are concerned about the structural integrity of the aircraft.. Emergency descents are normally conducted with the undercarriage up. If structural integrity is a concern, consider descent with the undercarriage down in order to increase drag and enable a higher rate of descent at a lower speed. If the undercarriage is to be extended, don't forget the limiting altitude and speeds..
