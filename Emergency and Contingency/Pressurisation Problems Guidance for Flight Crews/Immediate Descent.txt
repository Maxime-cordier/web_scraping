The aircraft's emergency oxygen supply is finite; in most aircraft, the supply will last little more than 15 minutes, perhaps less. If the crew cannot immediately correct the pressurisation issue, they should commence immediately an emergency descent to 10,000 ft or the minimum safe altitude, whichever is higher. An emergency should be declared (MAYDAY) and ATC told that the aircraft is in descent. In a high density traffic area, when there may be a number of aircraft in close proximity, it is wise to declare the emergency and ask for descent before commencing descent. However, if that clearance is not immediately forthcoming, descend without it - the aircraftâ€™s oxygen supply may be exhausted faster than you think, so any delay in commencing descent may prove fatal to crew and passengers.
