At the first indication of a pressurisation problem, or symptoms of Hypoxia, the flight crew should don oxygen masks. At cruising altitude, the Time of Useful Consciousness can be less than one minute so it is imperative that, in the event of a explosive or rapid depressurisation, the flight crew don oxygen masks immediately. Although more insidious, gradual loss of cabin pressure also poses a grave risk and should be reacted to as soon as it is recognised.
