Crews should follow company approved emergency procedures and manufacturer's guidance regarding the conduct of the flight and management of aircraft systems when confronted with any Loss of Cabin Pressurisation event. If an uncontrolled increase in cabin altitude is observed before that altitude reaches a critical value, intervention as directed by the manufacturer, such as switching or cycling the cabin pressure controller, may be considered if time permits. However, if control of the cabin pressurisation cannot be regained without delay or if the cabin altitude reaches a critical value, other measures must be taken to ensure the safety of the passengers, crew and aircraft. This article considers some aspects of airmanship which are applicable to all aircraft and situations.
