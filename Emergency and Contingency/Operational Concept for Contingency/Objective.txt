An operational concept for contingency should provide a common language between all parties involved, i.e. State(s), ANSPs, military organisation(s), airspace users, airports, etcâ€¦, to capture needs and set-up requirements that avoid misunderstandings. It will also provide a set of clearly defined requirements that will further support the definition and implementation processes. It will deliver a set of safety, security and performance criteria to be satisfied by the future system. It can ensure consistency with recognised safety assessment techniques such as the EUROCONTROL Safety Assessment Methodology (SAM) and the Safety Case Development methodologies that start their assessment process from the Operational Concept downward to the system design approach. In the same way the Operational Concept also needs to be consistent with the aims and objectives of the ATM Security Risk Assessment Methodology to ensure that specific ATM Security threats are properly captured. An Operational Concept also helps to provide a setting to undertake the economic assessment of contingency
