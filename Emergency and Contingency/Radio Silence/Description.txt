Imposition of radio silence is a procedure that is sometimes used in case of aircraft emergency. The purpose of radio silence is to ensure the frequency channel is available exclusively to the aircraft in distress so that better service is provided: Exchange of information (pilots elaborating on the situation and controllers providing useful information) is easier. Navigational assistance (which is sometimes necessary during emergencies) requires considerable time spent on communication. Distraction of both the flight crew in distress and the air traffic controllers is reduced so that they may focus on the emergency situation. There are two ways to ensure radio silence: Suppressing the calls from other aircraft on the frequency. Aircraft requested to maintain radio silence are expected to do so until advised that the emergency situation has been resolved.. Transferring the communicaiton with the rest of the aircraft to other frequency (or frequencies). Transferring the distress traffic is considered inappropriate because (a) the stress and workload levels in the cockpit are already high and (b) in such situations the possibility for human error is greater and may lead to loss of communicaiton. The transfer may be done using a single "all stations" call (see Phraseology section below as well as the Notes) or by transferring each aircraft using a separate instruction.. Whether radio silence will be imposed and if so, which method will be used, is decided by the controllers involved based on the specific circumstances.
