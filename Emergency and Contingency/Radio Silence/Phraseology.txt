This section contains phraseology to be used for imposing and terminating radio silence. If the controller needs to impose radio silence, the following general call is used:. All stations [ATS unit] stop transmitting. Mayday. If appropriate, the controller may also address a specific traffic:. [Aircraft callsign] stop transmitting. Mayday. When the emergency is resolved and radio silence is no longer necessary, the controller cancels it using a general call:. All stations [ATS unit] distress traffic ended. The controller may use the following phrase to transfer all aircraft except the one in distress to another frequency:. Mayday, [callsign of aircraft in distress], remain this frequency, break break, all other aircraft contact [appropriate ATS unit] [frequency], out Notes: The last example is taken from UK CAA's CAP 413 (Radiotelephony Manual) and not from an ICAO document. Using an "all stations" call (as opposed to transferring aircraft one by one) has higher potential for aircraft changing to a wrong frequency. Using an "all stations" call for this purpose may be contrary to local procedures.
