TMA/Approach Procedural Control could provide a limited capability provided that ATCOs are properly trained and endorsed. Continuation training will be necessary to maintain the special skills and validity of the appropriate endorsement/ rating. Similarly, other strategies have implications on training provision. For example, if ANSPs implement a multi-use approach then the use of a training centre as a location for fallback facilities will remove critical resources from those teams that now have to train additional ATCOs and engineering teams to use the contingency facilities. Contingency managers need to access the shared resource to run recuperation drills; the resource would then not be available for use by other members of an ANSP.
