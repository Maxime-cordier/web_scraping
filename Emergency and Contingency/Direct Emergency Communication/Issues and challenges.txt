While direct emergency communication offers valuable benefits during emergency situations, there are also some issues that need to be addressed and a number of challenges to be overcome: Direct emergency communication is not-so-effective unless widespread – the benefits are limited if the procedures only apply at a few aerodromes.. At some aerodromes the capability is offered in the local (non-English) language only thus limiting the usability;. Different procedures in different countries/aerodromes further limit the benefits;. Different frequencies are used in different countries/ aerodromes – while this is generally a minor issue, the use of one frequency globally (or at least regionally) would save valuable seconds when time is critical;. New equipment and training are needed – these cost time and money;. The costs and benefits are not equally spread between the participants – ARFF have the highest proportion of the costs while airlines and ATC benefit the most..
