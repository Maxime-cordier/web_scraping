The direct communication between the flight crew and the ARFF offers a number of advantages over the standard communication loop: Faster information exchange between the flight crew and ARFF. Better situational awareness for all personnel involved (flight crew, ATC, ARFF);. Better coordination between the flight crew and ARFF;. Reduced risk for ARFF team – e.g. reduced chance of injury due to unexpected evacuation slides deployment;. Reduced risk for the passengers during an evacuation – ARFF heavy equipment and extinguishing devices in proximity of the aircraft can be a source of danger to the passengers;. Avoidance of unnecessary evacuation and facilitation of controlled evacuation (the latter is performed when there is no immediate danger; the speed is slower but the risk of injury is reduced);. Reduced communication on the ATC frequencies and reduced controller workload;. If required or appropriate, it is very easy to revert to the standard communication loop with the controller assuming the mediator role..
