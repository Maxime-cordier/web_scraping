It is well known that not all catastrophic events and related scenarios can be foreseen but a variety of measures might be taken in order to ensure institutional adequacy and personal training: Organisational Awareness - training drills should include inter-organisational communication scenarios and should measure overall response time. The fast provision of additional ATCOs during emergency/crisis situations should be an objective at the administrative level. Periodic training and drills are likely to improve intra-organisational coordination. Personnel Management - A non-routine situation may require additional staff to provide ATC service to non-affected traffic or act as liaison personnel. Training is another aspect that increases preparedness and reduces ATCO’s stress in non-standard situations. Personal Awareness and Adequate Reaction – Controllers' awareness of any ongoing or planned disruption to the normal operations and communications within their area of interest should be maintained continuously. They should be prepared to provide any information necessary for the air crews to understand the scale of event and its related consequences for the safe conduct of the flights.
