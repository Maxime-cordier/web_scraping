of traffic and process numerous re-routings and diversions to alternate aerodromes. In order to achieve this, the ANSP must be prepared to: The different types of ATC units will face different operational challenges and no crisis management plan can predict for every eventuality. The ATC Units must be able, to the best of their ability, to respond in a safe and orderly manner with the system-wide crisis. Nevertheless the ATC Units must be prepared for certain common factors. Some of these expected common factors might include: En-Route Control ATC Units The complexity and configuration of airspace could make the efficient and expedite provision of en-route control service problematic, particularly in congested areas of en-route airspace. Expect: Defenses: Approach Control ATC Units The proximity of the approach control unit to the affected area will determine, to a certain extent, the increase in controller's workload and may cause temporary disruption of the ATC service provided. Expect: Defenses: Tower Control ATC Units The proximity of the aerodrome to the affected area will determine, to a certain extent, the workload at the tower control unit. Expect: Defenses:
