The term MINIMUM FUEL has, in the past, held different meanings for different aircraft operators and in different parts of the world. Until 2012, there was no dedicated phraseology to be used when it has been determined that an aircraft will land with less than final reserve fuel except the declaration of a MAYDAY nor has there been any dedicated phraseology to be used when it has been determined that an aircraft may land with less than final reserve if any delay not already notified were to occur. Since 15 November 2012, amendments to both ICAO Annex 6 Part I and the Procedures for Air Navigation Services – Air Traffic Management (PANS-ATM) Doc 4444 have been in effect. They state: Minimum fuel - The term used to describe a situation in which an aircraft’s fuel supply has reached a state where the flight is committed to land at a specific aerodrome and no additional delay can be accepted. (PANS-ATM, Doc 4444) In circumstances where an aircraft has declared minimum fuel or is experiencing an emergency, or in any other situation wherein the safety of the aircraft is not assured, the type of emergency and/or the circumstances experienced by the aircraft shall be reported by the transferring unit to the accepting unit and any other ATS unit that may be concerned with the flight and to the associated rescue coordination centres, if necessary. (PANS-ATM, Doc 4444)
