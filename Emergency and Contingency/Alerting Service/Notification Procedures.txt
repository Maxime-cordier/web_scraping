The ATS unit responsible for alering service: Rescue coordination centres are notified about: The above does not apply when there is reasonable certainty that the aircraft and its occupants are not threatened by grave and imminent danger and do not require immediate assistance. All information given to the rescue coordination centre is normally communicated to the aircraft operator as well. If considered practicable by the ATS unit, the aircraft operator may be notified first. Other aircraft in the vicinity of the emergency situation are also informed about it except in case of known or suspected act of unlawful interference. In such situations, the ATS unit would not refer to the nature of the emergency unless this is done by the aircraft involved and it is certain that doing so will not aggravate the situation.
