The objective is to provide a road map for the different roles and responsibilities that must be identified within an air navigation service provider (ANSP) - not only to coordinate the initial drafting of a contingency plan but also to ensure that it is resilient to changes in infrastructure, policies and procedures - for instance as normal operations change then contingency managers must ensure that contingency and fallback procedures are also revised.
