As with the other phases of an emergency, the AEP should identify assignments, organization responsibilities, command and control, and other required functional areas. If an airport has been closed because of an emergency situation, it should not re-open until assigned personnel have ensured that: Aircraft operating areas are safe and secure.. Aircraft movement areas to be reopened have been inspected.. Adequate aircraft rescue and firefighting protection is available (if applicable).. Public safety is assured.. The AEP should identify who is responsible for documenting all actions taken, including providing facilitation for the creation of the safety occurence report. These reports should cover all pertinent information in accordance with the provisions in ICAO Annex 13. Airport personnel should continuously monitor changing airfield conditions throughout the emergency situation and issue appropriate NOTAMs. Additionally, an AEP should: Identify the party responsible for ensuring that airport facilities are assessed during the recovery phase of the incident.. Specify responsibilities and additional resources for all cleanup and repairs.. Identify the roles and personnel for the recovery process and for returning the airport to normal safe operations; it may require coordination of schedules.. Identify all appropriate air traffic control (ATC) facilities and contact information..
