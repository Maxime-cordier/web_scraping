Flight through precipitation from contaminated clouds, or flight within volumes of contaminated air, is likely to lead to deposition of contaminated particles on the airframe. Such depositions may remain after landing in areas not directly exposed to airflow effects. Useful practical guidelines relating to decontamination have been issued by the AEA: AEA Guidelines on Radioactive Contamination of Aircraft and Engines, 3rd Edition, June 2002. Company advice should be available on the actions to take in the event of suspected contamination. In the absence of such advice being available before flight, commanders may wish to consider the wisdom of flying through an area where there is potential for contamination to occur. Note also that once on the ground, local authorities may well take over decontamination procedures, possibly also removing control from the aircraft commander; this would need careful handling and management to safeguard the best interests of passengers and crew.
