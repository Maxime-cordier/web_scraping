If the aircraft encounters radioactive material, either in-flight or while on the ground, flight crews should follow company approved emergency procedures and manufacturers guidance regarding the conduct of the flight, and management of aircraft systems Dealing with a situation that has already occurred and for which avoidance plans have been put in place may be relatively straightforward. However, dealing with an unexpected situation that happens in flight would be more difficult to manage. Crews and operators who have spent some time ‘thinking the unthinkable’ before such an event will invariably be better prepared. NOTE: Issues relating to exposure to naturally occurring radiation at high altitudes are covered in a separate article on Cosmic Radiation.
