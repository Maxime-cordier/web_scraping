In a January 2020 document cited in References below, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) characterises such situations this way: “Communication, as well as transferring information, enhances situational awareness, allows problem solving to be shared amongst crewmembers by enabling individual crewmembers to contribute appropriately and effectively to the decision-making process. Inadequate communications between crewmembers and other parties such as ground personnel, may lead to a loss of situational awareness, a breakdown in teamwork and ultimately to a bad decision or series of decisions which result in a serious incident or even a fatal accident.” Experience also shows that an absence of fatalities, serious injuries or aircraft damage in typical events of this nature should not cause complacency. The cases reviewed reveal issues such as: Flight attendants initiating an evacuation in the absence of an evacuation order from, or any coordination with, the flight crew;. Inadequate training of flight attendants to competently use the interphone to provide real-time information to the flight crew, in context of diverse and unfamiliar interfaces used on the same types of aeroplane; and,. Confusion on the part of the pilot-in-command (PIC) and/or flight attendants in ordering evacuation versus rapid deplaning.. The Optimal Emergency Communication section highlights a few examples of guidance issued in a January 2020 publication — IATA Cabin Operations Safety Best Practices Guide, Edition 6 — by a committee of international experts.
