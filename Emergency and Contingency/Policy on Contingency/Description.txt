It is recommended that ANSPs develop a policy for contingency in much the same way as they do for safety and security. The contingency policy should describe the organisation's attitude towards contingency and set out the internal requirements, goals and objectives. It should also define the scope of Contingency e.g. whether it includes the provision for “service continuity” or limits provision to emergency and “fail to safe” modes of operation. Economic guidelines may assist ANSPs and State authorities to form an opinion as to limiting provision to “fail to safe” modes of operations.
