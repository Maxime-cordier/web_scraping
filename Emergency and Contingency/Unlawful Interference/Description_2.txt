is not uncommon when unlawful interference is suspected (or has been confirmed). These missions may vary from information gathering (as for example in the case of B733, en-route, northwest of Athens Greece, 2005) to accompanying the aircraft or forcing it to land. As a last resort there is the option to use weapons against the aircraft subject to unlawful interference although such a decision is only to be made under extreme circumstances.. On some airports there are parts of the apron designated to be used in case of an aircraft subject to unlaful interferece. These are usually located at a safe distance from the airport critical facilities, other aircraft and passenger terminals and are used when e.g. there is a (suspected) bomb threat..
