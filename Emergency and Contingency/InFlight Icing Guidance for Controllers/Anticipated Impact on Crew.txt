The stress level for the crew on a flight with icing conditions is significantly higher than during a routine one. The pilots should maintain high situational awareness and closely monitor ice formation as immediate diversion could be necessary. The procedures for avoiding icing conditions include autopilot disengagement, change in altitude/heading or both and search for areas clear of clouds or with warmer temperature. All these pose significant amount of workload to the crew. Once the first signs of flow disruptions are shown, the crew will put all efforts and attention to regain control. Therefore, during this phase an ATCO could expect broken, incoherent communication with the aircraft.
