Pre-flight information - Crews should be supplied with latest weather information - they should also take the meteo-conditions into consideration while preparing for the flight.. Anti-icing, De-icing - Anti-icing and de-icing procedures should be performed with full compliance to the requirements. The tower controller should take into account the hold-over time that is reported by the crew.. Personal awareness - ATCOs should stay alert for any extraordinary climb/descent. They should be ready to provide climb/descent to affected traffic and allow space for horizontal manoeuvres. The aircraft experiencing severe icing would certainly need increased separation as its flying characteristics would be degraded.. Information dissemination - The controller should pass all reports for adverse icing conditions to the incoming traffic. He/she should also pass this information to the meteorological office for further processing and dissemination..
