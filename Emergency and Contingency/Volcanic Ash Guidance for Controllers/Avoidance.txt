Care should be taken not to route aircraft through clouds of volcanic ash where forecast on SIGMET charts. Where possible route aircraft upwind of the ash cloud.. Relay available ASHTAM information by reporting volcanic ash hazards to all aircraft concerned.. Note that weather radar will not detect the small particles in the ash clouds and crews may not get any advance warning of entering the ash cloud. ATC radars will not detect the presence of volcanic ash for the same reasons..
