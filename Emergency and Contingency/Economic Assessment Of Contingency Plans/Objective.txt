In order to help decision makers and contingency planners to scope contingency plans for service continuity with a higher degree of confidence, the plans should be substantiated by economic assessment before stakeholders' money is committed and work towards implementation begins. Contingency is an inherently unlikely event. Therefore economic assessment of contingency plans for service continuity raises specific issues. For instance, a prime objective is to achieve adequate contingency capability at a reasonably acceptable cost. The assessment of the value needs to take account of the very small likelihood of events such as fires and also the financial impact of such events on the ATM provision. The role of cost benefit analysis (CBA) within an overall economic assessment is to provide a means of assessing how to meet that strategy in the most cost effective way.
