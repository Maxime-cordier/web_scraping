Resolving landing gear problems can involve disabling features that control the configuration of other systems, for example a proximity switch on a landing gear leg that will signal whether a system should be in ground mode or air mode. It may also be necessary to inhibit part(s) of the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS). Such consequential matters need to be understood and properly briefed at appropriate stages of a flight where they are likely to have an effect, as will those aspects listed under Flight Planning Considerations (see below), which can apply whenever the landing gear has malfunctioned in flight.
