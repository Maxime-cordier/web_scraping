Flight crews encountering problems with the operation of landing gear must firstly, Fly the Airplane, then follow the appropriate EICAS or ECAM procedure, Emergency or Abnormal Checklist (EAC)/Quick Reference Handbook (QRH), Operations Manual and AFM direction and guidance for the resolution of problems and the continued safe conduct of the flight. This article covers some of the extensive range of airmanship considerations associated with landing gear problems that will vary from type to type. Crews should study Landing Gear emergency procedures in depth and regularly. When a landing gear problem does occur, it may well be as part of a larger failure scenario that has led to a loss of hydraulics, electrics and/or engines. Time available may also be limited if the failure becomes apparent towards the very end of a flight.
