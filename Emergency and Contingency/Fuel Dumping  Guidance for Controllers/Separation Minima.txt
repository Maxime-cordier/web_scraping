ICAO Doc 4444 PANS-ATM specifies the following separation minima to be used in respect to other known traffic in case of fuel dumping: at least 10 NM horizontally, but not behind the aircraft dumping fuel. vertical separation if behind the aircraft dumping fuel within 15 minutes flying time or a distance of 50 NM by: at least 1 000 ft if above the aircraft dumping fuel at least 3 000 ft if below the aircraft dumping fuel. at least 1 000 ft if above the aircraft dumping fuel. at least 3 000 ft if below the aircraft dumping fuel. The horizontal boundaries of the area within which other traffic requires appropriate vertical separation extend for 10 NM either side of the track flown by the aircraft which is dumping fuel, from 10 NM ahead, to 50 NM or 15 minutes along track behind it (including turns).
