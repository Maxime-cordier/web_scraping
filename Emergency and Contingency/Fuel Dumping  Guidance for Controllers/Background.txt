Fuel Jettison, more commonly referred to as Fuel Dumping, is the intentional, controlled, jettison of fuel from an aircraft whilst in flight. Not all aircraft designs incorporate a fuel dump capability and, even if dump capability is inherent to a particular aircraft type, a specific aircraft of that type may or may not be fitted with fuel jettison capability. Fuel dump may be initiated by the pilot to lighten the aircraft when performance is compromised due to failure of one or more engines whilst in flight. It can also be used to reduce the aircraft weight to a value below maximum landing weight when compelled to land earlier than expected due to a turnback or an enroute diversion.
