Best practice embedded in the ASSIST principle could be followed (A - Acknowledge; S - Separate, S - Silence; I - Inform, S - Support, T - Time): A - acknowledge the emergency, ask for intentions and provide information regarding suitable fuel dumping areas and altitudes as well as suitable landing aerodromes as necessary;. S - separate the aircraft from other traffic (see next section). If such an area exists, vector the aircraft to the designated fuel dumping area. Ensure that dumping occurs at an altitude that will allow evaporation/dissipation of the fuel before it reaches the ground - 5000 to 6000" AGL is usually sufficient.. S - silence the non-urgent calls (as required) and use separate frequency where possible;. I - inform the supervisor and other sectors/units concerned; inform the airport emergency fire rescue services and all concerned parties according to local procedures; inform other (uncontrolled) traffic in the vicinity using a general call, e.g. "All stations, [ATS unit], [TYPE] dumping fuel [level] [route or location]". S - support the flight by providing any information requested and necessary such as type of approach, runway length and any additional aerodrome details, etc.. T - provide time for the crew to assess the situation, execute the dumping procedure and complete associated checklists - donâ€™t press with non urgent matters..
