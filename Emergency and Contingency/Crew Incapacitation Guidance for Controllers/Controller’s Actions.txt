The advice in this section is derived from best practices and is not considered exhaustive nor is it intended to replace local procedures. There is little that a controller can do about recognizing the state of incapacitation or in terms of assistance in flying the aircraft. After the situation has been positively identified (e.g. by a flight crew report), the controller should take some (or all) of the following actions, as appropriate: Determine flight crewâ€™s intentions; most likely they would elect to land at the nearest suitable aerodrome;. Provide room for manoeuvring (e.g. emergency descent, most appropriate route to the aerodrome chosen, etc.) by clearing the way of other aircraft;. Inform the supervisor as soon as practicable; they are usually expected to notify other authorities and may assist in the coordination activities with other units/the aerodrome/etc.;. Inform other appropriate authorities, e.g. law enforcement in case of laser blinding or of an unruly passenger;. Coordinate emergency response services at the aerodrome chosen;. Determine crew intentions after landing; it is possible that the aircraft would remain on the runway;. Determine whether the crew are in full control of the airplane;. Any runway operations should be stopped at a reasonable time before the expected landing; if there is only one runway at the aerodrome cancelling the start-ups should be considered;.
