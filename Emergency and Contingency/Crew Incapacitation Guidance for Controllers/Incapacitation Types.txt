Generally speaking, there are two categories of incapacitation: obvious and subtle. The former is usually easy to recognize and its implications are fairly obvious. However the latter is often the more dangerous of the two due to the fact that the problem could remain unnoticed (even by the incapacitated person themselves). This easily prevents any corrective action being taken in time. Obvious (complete) incapacitation The first indication of illness may be loss of consciousness, seizures, severe pain or paralysis.. Onset may be sudden.. The victim may interfere with aircraft controls, by e.g.: Gripping controls during a seizure; Slumping forward on the controls; Behaving in a violent or aggressive manner;. Gripping controls during a seizure;. Slumping forward on the controls;. Behaving in a violent or aggressive manner;. The victim's condition may deteriorate rapidly and they may be in distress.. Subtle (incomplete) incapacitation Skills or judgement may be lost with little or no outward sign.. The victim may not respond to stimulus, may make illogical decisions, or may appear to be manipulating controls in an ineffective or hazardous manner.. Symptoms may be evident only in moments of high stress or workload.. The victim's condition may lead to more dramatic or complete incapacitation..
