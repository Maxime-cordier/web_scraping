In order to determine the most appropriate course of action to be taken by controllers, it is imperative they understand incapacitation cause(s) and potential effect(s). This understanding will provide the controller with reasonable expectations in terms of aircraft behaviour and allow them to determine the best ways to provide assistance. Some of the more common scenarios are: Medical problems (e.g. heart attack, food poisoning etc.) – usually affect only one crew member. The effects of administered medication could also affect the judgement and the response. That risk is substantial, particularly in cases of self-medication and treatment (e.g. self administered treatment with sleeping pills, anti-depressants or anti-allergy medicine, etc.) ;. Depressurisation – the exposure to an oxygen-poor environment may affect the entire flight crew to the point that they are no longer capable of taking normal, corrective or protective actions. The depressurisation could be slow and undetected (also known as ‘gradual or insidious depressurisation’), rapid or explosive. (e.g. due to an explosion or a broken windshield). In any of these cases it may cause hypoxia and, potentially, death.. Laser blinding;. Injury; it can be: accidental (e.g. due to turbulence, explosion, fire, etc) deliberate (e.g. due to unlawful interference, unruly passenger, etc). accidental (e.g. due to turbulence, explosion, fire, etc). deliberate (e.g. due to unlawful interference, unruly passenger, etc).
