Service Continuity is the availability of suitable arrangements allowing alternate air navigation services (ANS) services of an agreed quality of service to be readily activated when a long-term disruption of normal service provision is anticipated. Service Continuity is also characterised by containing the impact and duration of disruption of ANS critical services and the ability to restore a defined service level (capacity) with due priority.
