The Search and Rescue (SAR) function is a state obligation imposed by the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago, 7 December 1944) which is generally referred to as the Chicago Convention. Annex 12 to the ICAO Chicago Convention defines three emergency phases which are referred to as the Uncertainty Phase, the Alert Phase and the Distress Phase. These phases are defined as follows: Uncertainty phase (code word INCERFA): a situation wherein uncertainty exists as to the safety of an aircraft and its occupants. Alert phase (code word ALERFA): a situation wherein apprehension exists as to the safety of an aircraft and its occupants. Distress phase (code word DETRESFA): a situation wherein there is a reasonable certainty that an aircraft and its occupants are threatened by grave and imminent danger and require immediate assistance.
