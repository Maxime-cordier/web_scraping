Lightning Detection Networks (LDN) monitor thunderstorm development, intensity, and movement and are used for issuing severe weather warnings and forecasts. LDN’s exist in many countries and may be linked to operate on a Continental basis (e.g. EUCLID – European Cooperation for Lightning Detection). Often government operated (or funded), their purpose is multiple, but primarily to protect the public and certain industries through warnings, forecasts and deployment of rescue and response teams. Typical industries, apart from aviation, that rely on lightning and associated severe weather reports include power generation, forestry, hazardous materials, and sport and leisure. Historical archived data is also used to aid investigations, future predictions and insurance risk calculations. A typical LDN will consist of a network of fixed ground-based aerials that detect the electrical signals radiated from cloud-to-ground and cloud-to-cloud lightning discharges. At least three aerials are required to triangulate an accurate location. This ground-based network can also be supported by mobile ground detectors and space-based detectors. However, neither of these latter two will enhance the standard of service that is demanded by aviation – accuracy and speed: mobile units operating solo can introduce ambiguities of location, and satellite data takes several minutes to reach the user.
