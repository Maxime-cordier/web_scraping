Real-time data from an LDN provides ATC with information that is essential in coordinating aircraft movements and is also used to issue severe weather warnings to pilots. Ground-based weather radars may have restricted views due to terrain and there may also be large areas without weather radar coverage. Therefore, in these cases, lightning detection can provide the only immediate indication of severe weather. As well as lightning having an impact on “usable” en-route airspace, lightning and associated weather in the vicinity of an aerodrome can seriously disrupt operations – especially arrivals and departures. Lightning also presents a direct threat to Air Traffic Systems’ power supplies and therefore navigation and communication systems.
