Lightning may also indicate the presence of other meteorological hazards to operations. In some situations it may be the only reliable means of detecting these other hazards. Therefore, a reliable and accurate system for detecting lightning over a large area, and providing this information, in real-time, to pilots, aerodrome operators and air traffic units is a great benefit to safety.
