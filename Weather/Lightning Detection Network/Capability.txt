Capability of LDNs vary depending on the technology used and the density of antennas installed within the area of coverage. Reliability, detection rates and accuracy of location, intensity and movement can all be experienced above 90%. To provide an example of the information that is available, a short excerpt is shown below from the Canada Transport Safety Board Report into the accident - 2 Aug 2005, Air France Flight 358, Airbus-340 at Toronto: There was significant lightning activity in the vicinity of the runway late on the approach. An analysis of the cloud-to-ground lightning strikes that could have intersected the path of the aircraft was conducted using recorded lighting strike information. The analysis showed that, at approximately 2000:17, within a period of approximately one second, there were six cloud-to-ground lightning strikes in the area of the threshold of Runway 24L. At 2001:20, when the aircraft was approximately 400 feet agl, there was a group of five cloud-to-ground strikes abeam the touchdown zone, to the left of Runway 24L. At approximately 2001:49 (within a one-second period), five seconds before touchdown, there were nine cloud-to-ground lightning strikes off the end of the runway. These numbers are likely a conservative estimate of the number of lightning strikes visible to the crew, since they only account for cloud-to-ground lightning that could have intersected the approach path.[2]
