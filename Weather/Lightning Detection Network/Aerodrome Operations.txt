Lightning and associated weather present a hazard to many Ramp and other aerodrome activities and those personnel engaged in them, such as aircraft refuelling, construction and turnarounds. It is usual for Air Traffic Control (ATC) to provide aerodrome operations with relevant weather information, including updates on lightning and associated weather that could directly affect the aerodrome. This allows the aerodrome to postpone and suspend certain operations until the risk has passed.
