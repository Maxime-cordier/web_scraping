A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Rarely, cold core funnel clouds are possible if shear is significant along the cold front. Small isolated occluded fronts often remain for a time after a low pressure system has decayed and these create cloudy conditions with patchy rain or showers. However, the clouds and precipitation are not really where the projection on the Earth's surface of the occluded front is, particularly with a warm occlusion (as shown in the diagrams above) but with the trough of warm air aloft (TROWAL) position.
