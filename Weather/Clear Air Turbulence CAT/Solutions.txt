Slow down. Reducing the aircraft speed reduces the risk of structural damage and reduces vibration making instruments easier to read.. Strap in. Notify the crew/illuminate seat belt sign. All passengers and crew should immediately sit down and fit seat belts/harnesses.. Switch on Engine Ignition - Certain aircraft types recommend turning ignition on to prevent the turbulent airflow from flaming out engines.. Inform ATC. Notify ATC/warn other aircraft on chat or guard/emergency frequency (121.5 or 243.0). Request clearance to climb/descend or diverge from track to escape turbulence.. Assess Damage/Injuries. Carry out a damage assessment and ascertain condition of any injured passengers. Consider precautionary diversion.. Suspend Cabin Service. Obviously the serving of hot drinks and meals during turbulent conditions puts both cabin crew and passengers at risk..
