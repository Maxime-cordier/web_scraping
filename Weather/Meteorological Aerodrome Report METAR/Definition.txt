Meteorological Aerodrome Report (METAR), also known as Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Weather Report, Meteorological Terminal Air Report or Meteorological Airfield Report is a format for reporting weather information. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) describes METAR as the aerodrome routine meteorological report. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the UK Met Office all describe a METAR as aviation weather report.
