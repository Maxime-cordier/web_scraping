stated to the nearest whole hectopascal (equivalent to a millibar) rounded down and preceded by the letter Q e.g. Q1013 = QNH 1013 Hectopascals. Recent Weather Significant recent weather observed in the period since the last routine observation will be reported by using the code letters for weather preceded by the letters RE e.g. RETS = Recent Thunderstorm. Wind Shear In a METAR, civil aerodromes may include wind shear if reported along the take off or approach paths in the lowest 1600 ft with reference to the runway. WS is used to begin the group, e.g. WS TKOF RWY20. If the wind shear is affecting all runways, WS ALL RWY is reported. Aerodrome Colour State UK military and USAFE aerodromes will include the abbreviated colour state at the end of the message and ad the forecast colour state after the TREND. Runway State Group (RSG) NOTE: The RSG is omited from the METAR since the introduction of the new SNOWTAM format in 2021. However, this information is still included in some states (e.g. Russia). An 8-figure group which may be added to METAR from civil aerodromes. the quoted depth is the mean of a number of readings or, if operationally significant, the greatest depth measured. The mean value is transmitted or, if operationally significant, the lowest value, e.g.: Note: If contamination conditions cease to exist, the abbreviation CLRD is used, e.g. TREND TREND forecasts are indicated by BECMG (Becoming) or TEMPO (temporary) which may be followed by a time group (hours and minutes UTC) preceded by one of the letter indicated FM (from), TL (until), AT (at) e.g. BECMG FM1030 TL1130 NOSIG replaces the TREND group when no significant changes are forecast to occur during the 2 hour forecast period. To indicate the end of significant weather the abbreviation NSW (No Significant Weather) is used. Only those elements for which a significant change is expected should be included in a TREND.
