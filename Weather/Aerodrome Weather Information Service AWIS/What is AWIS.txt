The AWIS provides the aviation industry, in particular pilots, with current (one minute) observations of surface wind, pressure, air temperature, dew point temperature, rainfall, cloud information, humidity, visibility and present weather. These can either be used in the flight planning phase or prior to approach to the aerodrome. The weather observations can assist in the following ways: Rainfall indicates the wetness of the runway for braking distances; Pressure (QNH) is used for setting altimeter and allows a lower approach minima (Approach with Vertical Guide (APV)); Cloud and visibility allows the pilots to determine if current conditions are better (or worse) than required minima(s); Dewpoint and humidity can indicate the possible existence of fog, mist or low cloud (particularly useful where there are no ceilometers or visibility sensors installed); and Temperature is used for approach and take-off calculations. The QNH broadcast on the AWIS is considered an approved source of QNH. The format of AWIS is largely aligned with ICAO ATIS and Local Met Report format.
