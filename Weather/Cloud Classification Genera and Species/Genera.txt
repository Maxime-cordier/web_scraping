The classification of clouds has 10 main groups, or genera. Each observed cloud is a member of one, and only one, genus. High level cloud High level cloud refers to cloud with a base above 20,000 feet. Mid level cloud Mid level cloud is cloud with a base above about 6,500 feet. ('Alto' means medium.) Low level cloud Low level cloud, described as having a base below about 6,500 feet, is of most interest to pilots and controllers because of the impact on the safe conduct of flight particularly with regard to poor visibility, turbulence and structural damage, icing, and runway contamination.
