Clouds may sometimes be accompanied by other usually smaller clouds, known as accessory clouds, which are separate from the main cloud body or partly merged with it. Pileus: An accessory cloud of small horizontal extent, in the form of a cap or hood above the top or attached to the upper part of a cumuliform cloud that often penetrates it. Several pileus may fairly often be observed in superposition. Occurs principally with Cumulus and Cumulonimbus.. Velum: An accessory cloud veil of great horizontal extent, close above or attached to the upper part of one or several cumuliform clouds that often pierce it. Occurs principally with Cumulus and Cumulonimbus.. Pannus: Ragged shreds sometimes constituting a continuous layer, situated below another cloud and sometimes attached to it. Occurs mostly with Altostratus, Nimbostratus, Cumulus and Cumulonimbus. Flumen: Bands of low clouds associated with a supercell severe convective storm (Cumulonimbus), arranged parallel to the low-level winds and moving into or towards the supercell. These accessory clouds form on an inflow band into a supercell storm along the pseudo-warm front. The cloud elements move towards the updraft into the supercell, the base being at about the same height as the updraft base. Note that flumen are not attached to the murus wall cloud and the cloud base is higher than the wall cloud. One particular type of inflow band cloud is the so-called 'Beaver's tail'. This is distinguished by a relatively broad, flat appearance suggestive of a beaver's tail..
