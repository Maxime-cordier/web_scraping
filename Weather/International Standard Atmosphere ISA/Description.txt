Also known as the ICAO Standard Atmosphere, ISA is a standard against which to compare the actual atmosphere at any point and time. The ISA is based on the following values of pressure, density, and temperature at mean sea level each of which decreases with increase in height: The real atmosphere differs from ISA in many ways. Sea level pressure varies from day to day, and there are wide extremes of temperature at all levels. Variation in pressure, vertically and horizontally, affects the operation of the pressure altimeter.
