The boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere is known as the Tropopause and is covered by a separate article. Most light aircraft and turboprop aircraft fly within the troposphere and this is where most of the water vapour and therefore cloud formation exists. Many types of jet aircraft are able to cruise in the Stratosphere, especially in high latitudes where the Tropopause is lower, thereby avoiding almost all weather - although some particular vigorous thunderstorms may penetrate the stratosphere.
