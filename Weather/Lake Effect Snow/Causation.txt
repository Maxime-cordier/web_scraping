Lake effect snow forms when a cold air mass and accompanying winds move over warmer lake waters. The lake water raises the temperature of the proximal layer of air and moisture from the lake evaporates into the air mass. The moist, warm air rises and begins to cool causing the moisture to condense, freeze into ice crystals and form clouds which are then driven onto the shore by the wind. As the ice crystals collide, they stick together to become snow flakes and, when the flakes become heavy enough, snow begins falling. Under the right air mass and wind conditions, lake effect snow can occur virtually any time during the late autumn and winter months so long as the surface of the lake is not frozen. A frozen lake does not produce significant amounts of lake effect snow as an ice surface reduces both the temperature differential between the lake and the air mass and the available moisture. It is very unusual for the North American Great Lakes to become completely ice covered at any time during the winter. As a consequence, there is the potential for lake effect snow in the Great Lakes region throughout the entire winter season.
