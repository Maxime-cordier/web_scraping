Effective management of severe weather impact on the ATM system and flight operations is of great significance for improving the safety and cost-efficiency of aircraft operations and ATC service provision in Europe; in particular, in congested airspaces. Severe weather phenomena disrupt air traffic flows and generate significant delays. If not managed properly, hazards to aviation associated with severe weather can lead to an unsafe, high level of pilot workload or controller workload, and ultimately to losses of separation and aircraft accidents.
