In the 1939 edition of the International Cloud Atlas, the World Meteorological Organization assigned a unique identification code, and accompanying symbol, to cloud species, with the dropped middle letter denoting the altitude band to which the cloud belongs. Cloud height is based on the height of the cloud base, regardless of how high the cloud top may get. The cloud symbol is used when plotting station models on surface weather maps. This 27 part classificatory system places much greater emphasis on the processes of cloud growth and decay.
