There are many unknowns, including the occurrence rate of TGFs relative to lightning, the effect of the aircraft triggering the lightning, and the frequency and lengths of electron acceleration regions in thunderstorms. The estimated dose received by an individual in an aircraft struck by TGF or lightning-energetic electrons is about 30 mSv. Thus, a significant number of aircraft occupants may receive a large radiation dose.
