CAP 746 emphasises the need for aerodromes to anticipate contingencies and to prepare response plans for: Regarding automated present-weather detectors, however, CAP 746 states, “Guidance given by weather sensors can be misleading, such as when light drizzle and mist occurs; without observing from outside the building, it is often difficult for an observer to determine whether drizzle is present or merely dampness caused by mist or fog.” Predefined conditions dictate when to notify stakeholders of each failure to issue a forecast or the cancellation of a scheduled forecast due to missing or erroneous information in a METAR. Among negative effects on flight operations are interference with the normal flight planning and contingency management by aircraft dispatchers, and the related work by ATS managers and air traffic controllers. CAP 746 states, “The meteorological forecaster is required to take account of all meteorological variables when preparing an aerodrome forecast; METARs are used to verify base conditions before forecasting how these elements will change with time. Missing information in the METAR may lead to greater inaccuracies in the forecast, which may impact on tactical planning by pilots, operators and other aerodrome service providers.”
