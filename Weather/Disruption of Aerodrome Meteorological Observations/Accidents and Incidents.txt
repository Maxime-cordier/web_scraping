Aerodrome Met observations have been cited as a causal factor in aircraft accidents, CAP 746 provides the following example. Accident investigators examined weather information provided by the aerodrome in relation to decisions by the pilots to commence or continue visual approaches to Samedan. They found that the relevant Met observations were an unreliable guide to conditions likely to be encountered by the accident pilots, and that reports from pilots of other aircraft approaching the airport were not consistently relayed to the accident pilots. “[Flight information service officers] were unable to append trend information to their METARs and since it was, as a result, only possible to terminate a METAR with ‘NOSIG’ [no significant changes are forecast], there was the potential for crews to be misled,” the publication said. Other findings were that automatic terminal information service broadcasts did not match the current METAR, and special reports were not transmitted to the pilots. Also, the final report of the accident investigation stated that “weather minimums at the time of the accident involved a considerable risk” and that “the visibility and cloud bases determined on Samedan airport were not representative for an approach from [the northeast] because they did not correspond to the actual conditions in the [Runway 21] approach sector.”
