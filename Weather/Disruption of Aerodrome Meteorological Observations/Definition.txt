The United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (U.K. CAA) offers the aviation industry a simple definition of aerodrome meteorological (Met) observations: “The purpose of a weather (WX) observation is to provide a complete picture of the conditions at the aerodrome to a variety of recipients. … Aerodrome meteorological observations are used for flight planning purposes and to facilitate safe operation of aircraft in the takeoff and landing phases of flight.”
