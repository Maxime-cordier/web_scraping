Constant availability of aerodrome Met observations and forecasts is a critical part of mitigating several risks during aircraft operations. Preparing, protecting and restoring valid data requires accredited observers and forecasters to have: up-to-date knowledge of evolving atmospheric science and information technology/communication systems;. a multi-disciplinary skill set acquired in an approved program of theoretical and practical training;. recent local experience to reinforce the ability of the observer or forecaster to meet the dynamic data needs of end users; and,. accurate primary sensors and instruments integrated with a contingency plan, spare equipment for backup, fail-safe communication networks and standby personnel.. Met observers also have to master subtle distinctions to describe and categorize the weather characteristics on and near aerodromes. This skill set also extends to detecting sensor and automation anomalies. They also must judge exactly when and how to override semi-automated and automated systems (CAA). Avoiding and recovering from disruptions begins with compliance of the aerodromeâ€™s meteorological instruments and systems with regulatory standards for facility/equipment siting, installation, maintenance, calibration, performance, service continuity, protection and backup of data and power supplies.
