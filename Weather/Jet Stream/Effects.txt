Ground Speed. Aircraft flying west-east will try to exploit the Jet Stream to increase ground speed and, similarly, aircraft flying East-West will plan to avoid the Jet Stream. An unexpected encounter with a Jet Stream while heading West, or failure to gain the expected benefit of flying with the Jet Stream on a west-east flight, will reduce an aircraft's planned fuel reserves overhead its destination and, in extreme cases, cause it to declare a fuel emergency or divert to an enroute airfield in order to refuel.. Clear Air Turbulence. Aircraft flying close to a Jet Stream may encounter Clear Air Turbulence (CAT) (CAT) caused by Low Level Wind Shear. The CAT is strongest on the cold/low pressure side of the jet (the north side in the northern hemisphere) next to and just underneath the axis of the Jet Stream. Not all jet streams are turbulent but aircraft exploiting the tailwinds afforded by a Jet Stream often experience light to moderate turbulence for much of the flight. This turbulence can sometimes be severe and has on at least one occasion led to the death of a passenger (see Further Reading). Jet Streams passing over mountains usually produce waves of considerable amplitude and this increases the risk of turbulence.. Indicated Airspeed. An aircraft descending from calmer winds to stronger winds will encounter an increase in indicated airspeed. care should be taken when flying at maximum speed not to overspeed the aircraft. Likewise, an aircraft flying into a rapidly increasing tail wind jet stream can see a reduction in indicated airpseed and if not managed end up in an airspeed low scenario..
