Hurricanes typically occur between the months of August and October. They sometimes originate in the Caribbean Sea but more generally to the east. After formation they move west or north west and, while some continue into Mexico, most recurve across the islands or the Florida peninsula and pass into the North Atlantic. The frequency and severity of storms varies from year to year and may be influenced by other climatic factors such as El Nino/La Nina.
