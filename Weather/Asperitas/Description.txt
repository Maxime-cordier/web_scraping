Similar to Mammatus clouds - sinking, moisture laden clouds are carved into bizarre looking shapes carved by wind shear along the cloud base. Where the undulations are in bands, the prefix "undulatus" is used. Asperitas is a newly-classified cloud by WMOâ€™s International Cloud Atlas, mainly because of its shape but also its inner dynamics.
