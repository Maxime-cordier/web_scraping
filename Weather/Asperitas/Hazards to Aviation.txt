Although Asperitas is associated with gravity waves and wind shear, limited research in this area suggests that Asperitas does not pose a threat to aviation. The turbulence caused may, depending on aircraft type, be light to at most moderate chop, but it is doubtful that severe turbulence may be encountered in and at Asperitas base. Icing is, as described above, not considered a factor in Asperitas.
