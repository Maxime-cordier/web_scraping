Temperate zone infrastructure is often not designed for the high temperatures associated with a heat dome. As a consequence, there may be challenges associated with interruptions to power supplies, damage to operating surfaces at airports, or systems failures which may cause delays and capacity problems that affect multiple airports and service providers. Furthermore, the prolonged hot and dry weather can increase the risk of wildfires and heat-health issues. Flights through the heat dome will experience higher than usual (ISA) outside air temperatures at medium and higher flight levels with a consequent impact on aircraft performance, e.g. fuel consumption.
