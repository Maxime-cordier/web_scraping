In still, dry summer conditions, a mass of warm air builds up. Sinking air with the high pressure pushes the warm air down. The air is compressed, and as its net heat is now in a smaller volume, so it must get hotter. As the ever warmer near the surface air attempts to rise, the high pressure above it forces it down, to get hotter, and its pressure grows higher. The high pressure acts as a dome, or lid, causing everything below it to get hotter and hotter. The upper-level high pressure blocks any rain-making systems. The sinking air suppresses cloud formation, thus allowing intense summer sunlight to heat the air near the ground. In summer, heat domes are associated with heat waves at the surface and can last for weeks. 500mb pressure chart showing Heat dome over southern British Columbia June 2021.
