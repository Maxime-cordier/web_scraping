The passage of a medicane can cause significant disruption to airport and ATC operations as a result of strong winds and flash flooding. When Medicane Zorbas affected much of southern Greece, Crete and the Cyclades islands in September 2018, EUROCONTROL issued warnings to airspace users to expect delays and reroutes and load file accordingly.
