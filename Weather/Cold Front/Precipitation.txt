The amount of precipitation associated with a cold front depends on the amount of moisture in the air and the amount of lifting the front produces. You need both abundant moisture and strong lifting to produce significant precipitation. Sometimes bands of precipitation can occur well ahead of the front especially if the warm air mass is unstable. The cold front itself commonly brings a narrow band of precipitation that follows along the leading edge of the cold front. These bands of precipitation can be very strong and can bring severe thunderstorms, hailstorms, snow squalls, and/or tornadoes. In the spring, these cold fronts can be very strong, and can bring strong winds when the pressure gradient is higher than normal. Cold fronts sometimes come through an area with little or no precipitation. These dry cold fronts can cause wildfire control problems. Wider rain bands can occur behind some shallow cold fronts which tend to have more stratiform, and less convective, precipitation. These rainstorms sometimes bring flooding, and can move very slowly when the storm steering it is strong and embedded within a meridional flow pattern (with more pole to equator motion rather than west to east motion). If the low-level cold air behind such a front has below freezing temperatures, ice storms due to freezing rain are possible. In the winter, cold fronts can bring cold spells, and occasionally snow. In the spring or summer in temperate latitudes, hail may occasionally fall along with the rain. If moisture is not sufficient, such as when a system has previously moved across a mountain barrier, cold fronts can pass without cloudiness.
