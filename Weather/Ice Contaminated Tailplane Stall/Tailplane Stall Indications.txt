Indications of an impending tailplane stall, as determined under test flight conditions, include: Difficulty in trimming in pitch.. Reductions in elevator force required for control, especially in the forward sense.. Elevator control oscillation or pulsing with forward movement of the yoke much lighter than a corresponding aft movement. This can often lead to pilot induced oscillation (PIO). Reduction in elevator effectiveness. If tailplane stall occurs it will result in an abrupt and/or un-commanded nose down pitching manoeuvre that may be preceded or accompanied by sudden forward control column movement or snatch. NO indications of an approaching stall such as airframe buffet or activation of stall warning systems. Note: Flying with the autopilot engaged will mask the symptoms of an impending tailplane stall.. In all cases, indications might not become apparent until flap extention..
