The Caribbean climate is tropical, moderated to a certain extent by the prevailing north-east trade winds. Individual climatic conditions are strongly dependent on elevation. The long rainy season lasts from May to October and the dry season from December to March. Even in the wet season, precipitation varies depending on local topography; for example, the windward side of islands with mountains receive more rain than the leeward side.
