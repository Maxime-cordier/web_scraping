Fire whirls are violent and erratic in nature but there are currently three widely recognized types of fire whirls: Type 1: Stable and centered over burning area. Type 2: Stable or transient, downwind of burning area. Type 3: Steady or transient, centered over an open area adjacent to an asymmetric burning area with wind. The topography and wind patterns influence the type of fire whirl. Understanding of how type 3 fire whirls form is still limited. For example, type 3 fire whirls have been observed to form over water, burning with a blue flame indicating soot free combustion, described as a "blue whirl".
