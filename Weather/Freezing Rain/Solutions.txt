In Flight. The best response is avoidance: aircraft should be routed away from forecast/reported freezing rain horizontally and/or vertically. When in the vicinity of a warm front in winter, if performance, ATC, and regulations allow, consider flying above the freezing level, where the ice crystal precipitation will not have a chance to melt.. On the Ground. Check information on runway braking action before taxiing for take-off or attempting a take-off or landing. Generally airline and passenger/freight carrying operations are suspended during periods of freezing rain. Even without being prohibited by the operators manual, operations in freezing rain are difficult as the applicable Hold-Over Time from an anti-icing treatment is very limiting in freezing rain. This is because the ice accretion rates due to freezing rain can be much greater than those associated with other forms of winter precipitation. A typical hold over time can be as little as 15 minutes in light freezing rain, which can often mean that it is not possible to receive treatment and then take off within the allowable time frame. It should be noted that Holdover Time (HOT) Tables are not provided for operations in conditions of moderate or heavy freezing rain as the anti-icing fluid is not capable of providing protection under those circumstances. Ice pellets at surface level may indicate freezing rain aloft..
