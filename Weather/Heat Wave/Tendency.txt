High temperatures and heat waves in the last decade are widely blamed on climate change that occurred over the last 50 years, amounting to global warming of about 0.5Â°C, according to the study in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Heath waves are predicted to become harsher and more frequent as the Earth continues to warm over the course of the 21st century.
