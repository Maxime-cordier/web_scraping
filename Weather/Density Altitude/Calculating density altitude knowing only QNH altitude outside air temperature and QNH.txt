Density altitude is derived from pressure altitude, therefore QNH altitude is converted to pressure altitude. Pressure altitude is measured from the ISA mean sea level pressure isobaric surface (1013 hPa), and thus the QNH altitude is converted to its corresponding pressure altitude. The conversion factor of 27 ft hPa-1 will be used: PA = A + CV (1013 hPa – QNH) where A = QNH altitude (ft), and CV = conversion factor (27 ft hPa-1) Thereafter: DA = [A + CV (1013 – QNH)] + CF [Ta – Tstd] Standard temperature at a pressure altitude is derived from subtracting 2°C for every 1000 ft of pressure altitude: Tstd = 15 °C – 2 °C (1000ft)-1 (PA) DA = [A + CV(1013 – QNH)] + CF [Ta – [15 – 0.002 (A + CV (1013 – QNH)] = A (1 + 0.002CF) + CF (Ta – 15) + CV CF (2.026 – 0.002 QNH) – CV (QNH) + 1013 (CV) = 1.24A + 120 Ta – 33.48 QNH + 32115.24
