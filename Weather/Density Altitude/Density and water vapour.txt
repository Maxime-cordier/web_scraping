Water vapour is less dense than dry air. Therefore with increasing amounts of water vapour in air, with pressure and temperature constant, the air's density is decreased. Therefore, with increasing amounts of water vapour in the air, with pressure and temperature constant, density altitude is increased. However, this increase is less than one per cent of the total density, and therefore with the exception of low level regions in the tropics, the effect of water vapour on density is neglected.
