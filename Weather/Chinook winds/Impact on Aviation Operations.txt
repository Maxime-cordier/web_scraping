Airports located in areas that frequently see Chinook winds can experience significant changes in temperature within a short space of time. On the 22nd of November 2017, there was a temperature difference of 16Â°C between Calgary International Airport and Springbank Airport only 15nm away. Such potentially rapid changes in temperature mean that performance calculations should be reviewed just prior to take off to ensure they are based on the actual temperature. Likewise, the outside temperatures should be monitored on approach and care taken to apply the correct temperature error correction to approach altitudes. Rapid thawing and freezing of surface water can have an impact on surface friction and braking distance, with obvious ramifications for airport surface movement.
