Fohn Effect A föhn wind is a rain shadow wind which results from the subsequent adiabatic warming of air which has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes due to orographic lift. As a consequence of the different adiabatic rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than at equivalent elevations on the windward slopes. As moist winds from the Pacific (also called "Chinooks") are forced to rise over the mountains, the moisture in the air is condensed and falls out as precipitation, and the air cools at the saturated-adiabatic rate of 1.5°C / 1000 ft. The dried air then descends on the leeward side of the mountains, warming at the dry-adiabatic rate of 3°C / 1000 ft. The turbulence of the high winds also can prevent the usual nocturnal temperature inversion from forming on the lee side of the slope, allowing night-time temperatures to remain elevated. A strong föhn wind can make snow 30 cm deep almost vanish in one day. The snow partly melts and partly sublimates in the dry wind. Chinook winds have been observed to raise winter temperature, often from below −20°C to as high as 10–20°C, for a few hours or days, then temperatures plummet to their base levels. The greatest recorded temperature change in 24 hours was caused by Chinook winds on 15 January 1972, in Loma, Montana; the temperature rose from −48°C to 9°C.
