In 1990, the International Committee on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommended that jet aircrew should be considered occupationally exposed to ionising radiation. This has led to the introduction of corresponding exposure monitoring schemes in many jurisdictions. In Europe, aircrew liable to receive more than 1 mSv per year must be assessed and informed of the potential risks with tactical adjustment of working duties expected as a response to exposures significantly greater than the average. The purpose of this is to ensure that no aircrew will approach the internationally accepted limiting effective dose for all ionising radiation of 20 mSv per year averaged over 5 consecutive years or 50mSv in any one year. Whilst it is considered that it is most unlikely that aircrew would reach these limits under any current circumstance, the cautious approach to the risk being taken by some jurisdictions reflects the scientific uncertainty surrounding the possible cumulative effects of long term aircrew exposure to specifically cosmic radiation. The one particular area where aircrew may be affected by the general limits is the specific exception they make because of the potential for a heightened risk to the foetus in pregnant females by imposing an equivalent dose limit for such workers of 1 mSv during the declared term of the pregnancy. As a result of this, many airlines now have a policy of transferring pregnant aircrew to ground duties as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. To put this in perspective, it is estimated than a typical return transatlantic flight leads to an effective cosmic radiation dose of about 60Î¼Sv.
