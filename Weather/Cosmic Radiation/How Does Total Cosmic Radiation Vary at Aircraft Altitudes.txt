From the explanation above; the influences on radiation levels at typical aircraft altitudes of around 35000 ft can be summarised. In order of their relative importance, the four main influences are: Altitude - atmospheric shielding means that exposure increases as altitude increases. The exposure at aircraft altitudes is about 100 times greater than on the ground, but the increase is not linear and below about 25000 ft altitude, the increase over surface levels is modest. The maximum exposure is reached at 60,000 ft altitude.. Latitude - the difference in shielding between high and low latitudes has a much more marked effect on exposure at aircraft altitudes than at the surface. At 50Â° exposure is up to 4 times greater than at the equator.. Normal Solar Activity - the 11 year solar maximum reduces exposure by about 25% and the corresponding solar minimum increases it by about 25%. Random Solar Activity - SPE produce large but short-lived increases in exposure which double exposure during their occurrence..
