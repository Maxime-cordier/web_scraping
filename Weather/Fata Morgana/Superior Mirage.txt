A superior mirage occurs when there is a temperature inversion; the air below the line of sight is colder than the air above it. Passing through the temperature inversion, the light rays are bent down, and so the image appears above the true object, hence the name superior. Most superior mirages tend to be stable, as cold air has no tendency to move up and warm air has no tendency to move down. Superior mirages can make objects below the horizon visible at least in some form or distort the image of an object at the horizon. Superior mirages can make things appear bigger, closer, or suspended in air. A superior mirage can be right-side up or upside down, depending on the distance of the true object and the temperature gradient. Often the image appears as a distorted mixture of up and down parts. Superior mirages can produce a few different types of images: distant objects can appear to float high above their actual position, for example a boat can look like it is floating in the sky, or an object below the horizon can become visible. This is known as a looming type of superior mirage. Superior mirages can also distort images so that the object appears stretched and elevated, called towering.
