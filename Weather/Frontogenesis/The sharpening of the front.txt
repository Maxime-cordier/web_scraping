The effect of convergence towards a front is generally to narrow the transitional zone between the adjacent air masses. In other words to sharpen the front. Ageostrophic wind components directed towards the front on both sides, brings the isotherms closer together. The intervening air is squeezed upwards and the transitional zone becomes narrower and the front sharper. The sharpness of the front is maintained against the natural tendency towards a diffuse mixing of the air from each airmass.
