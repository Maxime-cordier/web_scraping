In the midlatitudes, cold, polar air masses meet warm, tropical air masses. It is here that fronts are generated. Officially, a front is a transition zone between two air masses of different densities or temperature. Frontogenesis is a term describing the formation of a weather front or the regeneration and intensification of existing, decaying fronts. The necessary conditions for frontogenesis are: Temperature Gradient - There must be a temperature difference between two air masses. For example, no frontogenesis takes place around the Equator where air masses are of similar temperature. The temperature difference or temperature gradient must be enhanced or concentrated. Isotherms on a temperature map would be close together.. Convergence of air masses - Air masses must be converging, attempting to occupy the same space..
