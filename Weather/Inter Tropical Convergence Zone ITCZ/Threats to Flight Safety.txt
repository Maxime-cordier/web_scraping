Aircraft flying through an active ITCZ (strong trade winds) will probably encounter some or all of the hazards associated with Cb clouds such as icing, turbulence, lightning, and wind shear. However, it is in this zone that the most severe effects may often be encountered. In particular, it is within the ITCZ that convective breakthroughs of the tropopause often occur, with the majority occurring over land, especially in the second half of each day. Convective penetration of the tropopause is less common over oceanic areas where the phenomenon is more likely to occur in the early hours of each day, generating more isolated cells. Research sponsored by National Aeronautics and Space Administration has shown that 1% of tropical deep convective activity exceeds 46,000 ft altitude, with a small proportion of this reaching much greater heights. For further information on the potential hazards of transit through or near Cb cloud, see the article Cumulonimbus (Cb). Even at the altitudes flown by modern jet air transport aircraft, it is likely that minor adjustments to route will be required to avoid either passing through or above significant convective build-ups. Turboprop aircraft are unlikley to be able to climb over such convection activity and weather avoidance actions can take aircraft significantly off track. It is therefore prudent to carry additional contingency fuel forweather avoidance and icing.
