FADEC equipped engines have surge protection logic, with the capability of automatically shutting down engines in circumstances of temperature surge such as that related to flow disruption, whereas engines with more traditional fuel control systems do not have this feature. The latter group of engines are more likely to suffer transient over-temperature conditions as an indirect result of a lightning strike, but may stand a greater chance of continuing to run thereafter since shut-down is primarily in the pilotâ€™s control.
