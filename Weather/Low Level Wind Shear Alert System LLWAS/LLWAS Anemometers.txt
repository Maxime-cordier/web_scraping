An LLWAS consists of a number of anemometers strategically placed around, and within, an aerodrome. Older systems used a minimum of 6 anemometers (one central and 5 perimeter) all within the aerodrome boundaries, whereas up-to-date systems can have over 30, with some placed up to 3 nautical miles (nm) along approach and departure paths. Predominantly, only horizontal wind shear is measured, i.e. all the anemometers are placed at similar heights above the aerodrome reference. However, at some aerodromes remote-sensing anemometers are placed on existing television masts and towers located in the vicinity of the aerodrome, and even on surrounding hills where known problems exist (e.g. Hong Kong), in order to observe and measure wind shear in the vertical. Aerodromes can be prevented from placing anemometers at preferred sites due to land ownership and access issues. Furthermore, to prevent interference with anemometer readings from local building development and terrain, some anemometers have to be sited at less than ideal locations.
