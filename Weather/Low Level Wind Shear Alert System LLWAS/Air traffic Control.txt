Air Traffic Controllers relay LLWAS alerts to all pilots on the relevant frequencies (Ground, Departures, Tower, Approach etc) until such time as the warnings are recorded on the ATIS and pilots have acknowledged the appropriate ATIS Code letter as being received. General warnings may be first issued e.g. Low level wind shear/microburst advisories in effect. Caution microburst minus 30 knots on final approach. Caution wind shear plus 25 knots on departure. Some warnings (especially in USA) may contain the centre-field wind followed by the relevant perimeter/runway wind e.g. Wind shear alert, Centerfield wind 150 at 12, North East boundary wind 060 at 25. At some aerodromes with integrated LLWAS and TDWR it is possible for ATC to issue wind information orientated to the approach threshold or departure end of the runway e.g. Runway 27 arrival microburst alert, 35 knot loss 2 mile final. Runway 09 arrival, wind shear alert, 20 knots loss on runway.
