LLWAS was developed and brought into service in the USA during the 1970â€™s; and the largest number of aerodromes employing LLWAS today are still in the USA. Despite three system upgrades, some of those still in use are of the older type. The most modern systems tend to be co-located and integrated with TDWR systems. In this respect, aerodromes elsewhere in the world who have recently deployed LLWAS tend to have the latest systems, also integrated with TDWR. Installing and maintaining an LLWAS can be costly and therefore they tend to be located at aerodromes with known Wind Shear and Microburst problems. The majority of airports worldwide do not have LLWAS. Provision of LLWAS at an airport/aerodrome should be listed in their entry in the Airport Directory under Weather Services/Weather Data Sources
