The FAA first launched their LLWAS programme following the 1975 accident of Eastern Air Lines Flight 66 at John F. Kennedy International Airport. On its final approach the Boeing 727 entered into a microburst or wind shear environment caused by a severe thunderstorm. The aircraft continued its descent, struck approach lights about 0.5nm from the Runway 22L threshold, and quickly crashed along an adjacent road. 107 passengers and 6 crew members died. At the time, it was the deadliest single plane crash in United States history. The FAA began its LLWAS-RS programme following the 1994 accident of US Air Flight 1016 at Charlotte, NC. The DC93 carried out an approach to runway 18R during convective weather (thunderstorms) conducive of microburst activity. During the subsequent missed approach the aircraft crashed into trees and houses killing 37 passengers..
