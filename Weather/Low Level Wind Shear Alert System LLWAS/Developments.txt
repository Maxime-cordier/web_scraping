Although LLWAS manufacturers claim detection reliabilities and accuracies above 90%, there is still room for improvement in accuracy and reliability of LLWAS. False alarms can be caused by gusty wind conditions, by less than ideal anemometer siting, e.g. shielding by obstructions, and by anemometers under/over-reading. It is even possible that unserviceable anemometers can still feed erroneous data into the system. New technology such as sonic anemometers can replace the mechanical vane anemometers. Being solid-state instruments, these new sensors have a much better reliability and maintainability. Sensor information from LLWAS can also be integrated with data from Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) (TDWR). Where this is installed, the outputs from the two systems will be integrated for the issuance of warnings. Two commonly used terms relating to upgraded LLWAS in the USA are briefly described below: However, Phase-3 LLWAS, utilising on average 10 to 20 anemometers (and in some cases over 30) is now widespread throughout the USA, and is the level of technology utilised for new installations worldwide; also, sometimes integrated with Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) data.
