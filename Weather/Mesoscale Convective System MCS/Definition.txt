Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) - A region where several thunderstorms have merged to create a continuous area of convective instability where cloud with a horizontal extent greater than 100 km (54 nm) exists. Such systems normally continue to exist for several hours. They can occur in both tropical and temperate latitudes.
