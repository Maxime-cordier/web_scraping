Additionally to the severe weather associated with MCCs, the MCC also creates “Mesohighs”, regions of cold air pools resulting from the downdrafts of multiple thunderstorms, creating a thermal high pressure area, but is not to be considered an anticyclone due to its lack of anticyclonic circulation. The winds in the Mesohigh flow away from the centre of the high pressure area. Weather not associated with MCCs (a “break in the storm and rain”) may occur with a Mesohigh. Squall lines in the MCC may also create Mesohighs.
