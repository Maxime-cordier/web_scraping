Air originating over the ocean is known as maritime air whilst air originating over a continent is known as continental air. Maritime air masses absorb moisture from the oceans and so contain more water vapour than a continental air mass. The amount of water vapour in the air (humidity) affects the performance of an aircraft; aircraft performance is slightly poorer in more humid air. In-Flight Icing is also more likely to occur in air masses with a high humidity. For further information see the separate article on Air Masses.
