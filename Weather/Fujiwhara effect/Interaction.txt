When two cyclones begin to interact, the relative size of the systems often dictates their ultimate interaction. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it, and finally be absorbed by it. It is when the two cyclones are relatively the same size that the true Fujiwhara Effect takes place. When cyclones are in proximity of one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically (counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere) about a point between the two systems due to their cyclonic wind circulations. The two vortices will be attracted to each other, and eventually spiral into the center point and merge.
