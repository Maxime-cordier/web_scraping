Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) Approach-and-landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) Briefing Note 5.4 â€” Wind Shear points out that "Flight crew awareness and alertness are key factors in the successful application of wind shear avoidance techniques and recovery techniques." Whenever wind shear conditions are forecast, or reported by other aircraft, pilots should include discussion of wind shear recognition and response in the takeoff or approach brief. Whether or not wind shear conditions are expected, the pilot must be able to recognise quickly when wind shear is affecting the aircraft. He/she may be aided in this by airport based warning systems (e.g. LLWAS and TDWR) or by onboard equipment, such as Ground Proximity Warning System or Airborne Wind Shear Warning Systems. ALAR Briefing Note 5.4 lists the following indications of a suspected wind shear condition: Indicated airspeed variations in excess of 15 kts. Groundspeed variations (decreasing head wind or increasing tail wind, or a shift from head wind to tail wind). Vertical-speed excursions of 500 fpm or more. Pitch attitude excursions of five degrees or more. Glideslope deviation of one dot or more. Heading variations of 10 degrees or more and,. Unusual autothrottle activity or throttle lever position..
