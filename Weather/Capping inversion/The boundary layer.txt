The boundary layer is the part of the atmosphere which is closest to the ground. Normally, the sun heats the ground, which in turn heats the air just above it. Thermals form when this warm air rises into the relatively colder air (warm air is less dense than cold air), a process described as convection. Then, this active boundary layer can be called the convective planetary boundary layer. A convective layer such as this has the potential for cloud formation because condensation occurs as the warm air rises and cools. For further information see the separate article on the planetary boundary layer.
