Pilots flying under visual rules should avoid flying beneath Ns because of the reduced visibility in Rain or Snow and the Stratus Fractus. Flight through or below Ns may be associated with downdrafts or Turbulence, but not as severe as would be encountered with Cumulonimbus (Cb). However, if the temperature is below 0Â°C, nimbostratus may be associated with In-Flight Icing.
