The Engadine Valley, or more precisely in this case the upper Engadine Valley, is a gently sloping wide Valley in comparison to its counterpart to the west, comparing Fig. 1 with Fig. 2. It begins at the Maloja Pass and for our intent in this paper ends near Zernez (roughly 30 km air distance north-east of St. Moritz), with valley elevation change of roughly 350 metres (compared to the relatively steeper 1500 metre change in the Bergaglia Valley). The Engadine Valley itself continues the length of the Inn River until the Austrian border. The height difference from valley floor (“V” designation in Fig. 2) to mountain peak (“P” designation in Fig. 2) is around 1400 metres, and its wide dimensions allow for much insolation.
