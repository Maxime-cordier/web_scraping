The region of source for the Maloja Wind is the Bregaglia Valley, a rather east-west aligned valley of roughly 30 km in length situated west of the Maloja Pass. The Valley elevation change is roughly 1500 metres. As Fig. 1 shows, the upper part of this valley has steep mountain walls on either side of its roughly 2 km width, and at its terminus by the Maloja Pass, the valley is roughly less than 1 km wide. This creates in itself a relative "box canyon" of sorts, blocking moist air from the regions of the Po Valley to the south of the area from entering the Engadine Valley. The height difference between valley floor (designated “V” in Fig. 1) and mountain peak (designated “P” in Fig. 1) is about 2000 metres, and is quite narrow.
