The Maloja Wind is generally limited with regards to altitude. The Valley walls are heated to such an extent that an inversion may form, capping the colder wind from reaching higher altitudes. Therefore at higher altitudes calmer winds may be experienced, along with an inversion. This may have consequences for aircraft using Samedan airport, as their performance decreases if air is warmer at altitude. The Maloja Wind generally flows in the main Engadine Valley, and is not very noticeable in side valleys. With a general north-easterly flow the Maloja Wind's effects and strength are reduced, to the point of being non-existent, although there may still be a noticeable SW-wind component near the Maloja Pass due to the effects resulting in the Maloja Wind. In the evenings, as insolation is reduced, the Maloja Wind lessens in intensity. At night, the katabatic wind flow patterns are generally the norm.
