Dfd: D = Continental f = fully humid d = very cold winter The subarctic climate (also called subpolar climate, or boreal climate) is a climate with long, cold (often very cold) winters, and short, warm to cool summers. It is found on large landmasses, often away from the moderating effects of an ocean, generally at latitudes from 50° to 70°N, poleward of the humid continental climates. Subarctic or boreal climates are the source regions for the cold air that affects temperate latitudes to the south in winter. These climates represent Köppen climate classification Dfc, Dwc, Dsc, Dfd, Dwd and Dsd. In the subarctic climate Dfd, the coldest month averages below -38°C and 1–3 months average above 10 °C . There is no significant precipitation difference between seasons, but summers are wetter. There is very little precipitation. These climates occur only in eastern Siberia. In north east Asia, the Siberian anticyclone dominates in winter and temperatures as low as -50°C are not unusual.
