Many of the incidents involving engine malfunction attributed to high level ICI have been investigated, primarily by engine manufacturers, in order to find out whether the redesign of some detail feature of their engine is required to prevent repetition. For various reasons, relatively few have been independently investigated in accordance with the principles of ICAO Annex 13. Some of these include: B752, en-route, Central Mauritania, 2010: On 25 August 2010, a Boeing 757-200 on a passenger flight from Freetown Sierra Leone to London Heathrow was in the cruise at night in IMC at FL370 when vibration levels on both engines increased. When the prescribed ice shedding drill was followed, one engine malfunctioned and vibration on the other remained abnormally high and so a MAYDAY was declared and a diversion to Nouakchott, Mauritania was made without further event. None of the 103 occupants were injured and there was no engine damage.. A346, en route, eastern Indian Ocean, 2013: On 3 February 2013, an Airbus A340 crew in the cruise in equatorial latitudes at FL350 in IMC failed to use their weather radar properly and entered an area of ice crystal icing outside the prevailing icing envelope. A short period of unreliable airspeed indications on displays dependent on the left side pitot probes followed with a brief excursion above FL350 and reversion to Alternate Law. Excessive vibration on the left engine then began and a diversion was made. The engine remained in use and was subsequently found undamaged with the fault attributed to ice/water ingress due to seal failure..
