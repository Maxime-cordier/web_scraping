The majority of supercooled droplets in clouds are between 1 micron (0.001mm) and 50 microns (0.05 mm) in diameter. (For comparison, the thickness of the average human hair is approximately 100 microns). Layer (stratiform) clouds typically contain average droplet diameters of up to 40 microns. Vertically developed (cumuliform) clouds of moderate scale typically have average droplet diameters of up to 50 microns (0.05mm) but large Cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds often contain much more liquid water, including large quantities in droplets with diameters up to and beyond 100 microns (0.1mm).
