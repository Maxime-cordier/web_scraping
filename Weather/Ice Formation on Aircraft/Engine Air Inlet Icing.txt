All aircraft certificated for flight in icing conditions are fitted with anti-icing systems. These prevent air intake lip and guide vane ice formation by use of electrically heated mats, circulated hot engine oil or bleed air extracted from the engine. However, further inside an air inlet, ice can form in unprotected areas even when an aircraft is not flying in icing conditions as presently defined for engine certification purposes. There are two such circumstances: the cooling of moist air above freezing temperature by pressure reduction in piston engines; and the melting of ice crystals which are warmed after entering turbine engines. In the first case, moist air entering a piston engine intake at a temperature above 0°C is then accelerated by a suction effect through a reduced channel. This ‘venturi’ effect reduces its temperature causing the moisture load to condense out and be precipitated on the walls of the air channel as ice. See Piston Engine Induction Icing for more detail. This article also describes two other types of induction icing which occur in piston engines. In the second case, high densities of very small ice crystals in very cold, high altitude air are ingested into high bypass gas turbines. They then either temporarily freeze and detach as larger pieces of ice causing engine airflow disruption, or cause mechanical damage either as pieces of ice or via discrete throughputs of liquid water.
