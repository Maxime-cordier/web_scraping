A parhelion (plural parhelia), also commonly known as sun dog or mock sun, is an atmospheric optical phenomenon that consists of a bright spot to one or both sides of the Sun. Two parhelia often flank the Sun within a 22° halo. The parhelion is a member of the family of halos caused by the refraction of sunlight by ice crystals in the atmosphere. The prerequisite ice crystals occur with cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. It is the occurrence and placement of these clouds that determine the parhelion appearance. Parhelia typically appear as a pair of subtly colored patches of light, around 22° to the left and right of the Sun, and at the same altitude above the horizon as the Sun. However, they can also be extremely bright (mock suns) and one can be brighter than the other. At times, only one may occur. They can be seen anywhere in the world during any season (ice crystal clouds occur at high altitudes where it is always cold), but are not always obvious or bright. Parhelia are best seen and most conspicuous when the Sun is near the horizon. This makes them more common in higher latitudes and in mid latitudes during the winter months when the sun is lower in the sky. Parhelion have been observed and noted for many years. The term “parhelion” is derived from the Greek term for “beside the sun”. “Sun dog” is also traced back to ancient Greece with these bright spots seemingly “following” the sun (or Zeus) like a dog. Although much less common, bright spots can occur with a very bright moon and are called paraselene.
