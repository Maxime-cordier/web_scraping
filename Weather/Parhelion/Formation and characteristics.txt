Parhelia are commonly caused by the refraction and scattering of light from plate-shaped hexagonal ice crystals either suspended in high and cold cirrus or cirrostratus clouds, or drifting in freezing moist air at low levels as what is know as "diamond dust". The crystals act as prisms, bending the light rays passing through them with a minimum deflection of 22°. As the crystals gently float downwards with their large hexagonal faces almost horizontal, sunlight is refracted horizontally, and parhelia are seen to the left and right of the Sun. Larger plates wobble more, and thus produce taller parhelia. Parhelia are red-colored at the side nearest the Sun; farther out the colors grade through oranges to blue. The colors overlap considerably and are muted, never pure or saturated. The colors of the parhelion finally merge into the white of the parhelic circle, the halo, (if the latter is visible). The same plate-shaped ice crystals that cause parhelia are also responsible for the colorful circumzenithal arc, meaning that these two types of halo tend to co-occur. The latter is often missed by viewers, because it is located more or less directly overhead. Another halo variety often seen together with parhelia is the 22° halo, which forms a ring at roughly the same angular distance from the sun as the parhelia, thus appearing to interconnect them. As the Sun rises higher, the rays passing through the plate crystals are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane, causing their angle of deviation to increase and the parhelia to move farther from the 22° halo, while staying at the same elevation.
