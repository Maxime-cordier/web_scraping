Graupel that collects on aircraft surfaces should be treated in the same way as snow. Particular attention should be paid to clearing Graupel that has collected in the joints next to control surfaces. Since Graupel is associated with winter storms, it may be a precursor to more dangerous types of precipitation such as Freezing Rain.
