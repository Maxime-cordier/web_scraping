Landspouts are a type of tornado that forms during the growth stage of a cumulus congestus cloud by stretching boundary layer vorticity (spinning) upward and into the cumulus congestus's updraft. This vertical stretching decreases the radius of the vortex and through the conservation of angular momentum, increases the spin rate. These generally are smaller and weaker than supercell tornadoes and do not form from a mesocyclone or pre-existing rotation in the cloud. Because of this, landspouts are rarely detected by Doppler weather radar. Landspouts share a strong resemblance and development process to that of waterspouts, usually taking the form of a translucent and highly laminar helical tube. Landspouts are considered tornadoes because a rapidly rotating column of air is in contact with both the surface and a cumuliform cloud. Not all landspouts are visible, and many are first sighted as debris swirling at the surface before eventually filling in with condensation and dust. Tornadoes can be classified into three groups depending on their formation. Type I is associated with a single, supercell thunderstorm. Type II occurs with quasi-linear convective systems such as squall lines. Type III forms when localized weaker convective cells interact with shear vortices in the boundary layer. These include cold-air funnels or snowspouts, waterspouts, and landspouts.
