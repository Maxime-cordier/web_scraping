The Glossary of Meteorology defines a landspout as a "Colloquial expression describing tornadoes occurring with a parent cloud in its growth stage and with its vorticity [or rotation] originating in the boundary layer. The parent cloud does not contain a preexisting mid-level mesocyclone. The landspout was so named because it looks like 'a weak Florida Keys waterspout over land'".
