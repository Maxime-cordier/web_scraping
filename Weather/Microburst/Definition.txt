A Downburst is created by an area of significantly rain-cooled, descending air that, after hitting ground level, spreads out in all directions producing strong winds. A Downburst affecting an area 4 km in diameter or less is commonly referred to as a Microburst (this term was defined by severe weather expert Tetsuya Theodore Fujita).
