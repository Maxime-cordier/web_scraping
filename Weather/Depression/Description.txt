Air in the upper Troposphere can be caused to change direction and speed, sometimes leaving a gap or void behind it which is filled by air rising up from the surface. The outflow of air from an area is known as "Divergence", while the inflow of air to the area of low pressure is called "Convergence". Air flows from high pressure to low pressure and, because of the rotation of the earth (coriolis effect), the strength and direction of the air flow depends on the pressure gradient, latitude, and hemisphere: Formation of a Depression A depression can also be formed as a result of surface heating, interaction between air masses, or the movement of an air mass over a mountain range.
