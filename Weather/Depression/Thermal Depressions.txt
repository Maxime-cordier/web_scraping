On a hot summer day, the land can heat up to such an extent that a large mass of air begins to rise. Where the heating is over an extended period, particularly over a continental landmass, this can lead to the general rising of air leading to the convergence of moist warm air from surrounding seas bringing continuous heavy rains that may last for several months (Monsoon).
