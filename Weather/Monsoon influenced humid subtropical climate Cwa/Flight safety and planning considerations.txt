In summer, gain an idea of the daily pattern of rainfall and avoid planning to arrive during predictable periods of thunderstorm activity. If arrival during thunderstorm activity cannot be avoided, consider carrying extra contingency fuel for any potential holding time while thunderstorms pass through the airport. Do not be tempted to to land or take off if a thunderstorm is over the airport.
