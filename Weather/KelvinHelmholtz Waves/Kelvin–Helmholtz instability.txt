The Kelvinâ€“Helmholtz instability (after Lord Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz) can occur when there is velocity shear in a single continuous fluid, or where there is a velocity difference across the interface between two fluids. An example is wind blowing over water: The instability manifests in waves on the water surface. More generally, clouds, the ocean, Saturn's bands, Jupiter's Red Spot, and the sun's corona show this instability. When the rising cooler air is moist, under the correct conditions, cloud forms in the crest of each wave. To the viewer on the ground, these appear as parallel bands of cloud. The waves break on top into cloud rolls. The axes of the cloud rolls are perpendicular to the wind shear.
