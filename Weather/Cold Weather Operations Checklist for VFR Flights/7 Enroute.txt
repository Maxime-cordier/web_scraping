a) if You are to fly into snow shower be prepared to revert to instruments as visual reference may be lost. b) if a “white out” (a condition in which there are no contrasting ground features in pilot’s visibility range) occurs - immediately shift to instrument flight. c) in icing conditions use anti-ice equipment in the manner for which it was designed (anti-ice equipment is to prevent ice formation, not to eliminate which has already built-up)
