a) during reciprocating engine shutdown a good practice is to turn off the fuel and run the carburetor dry. This lessens the fire hazard during preheat before next flight. b) fill the tanks with the proper grade of fuel, especially if the aircraft is going to be parked in a heated hangar. Do it as soon as possible after the landing. c) if the aircraft is to be left outside install engine and pitot tubes covers. d) if snow or “clear and colder” conditions are forecast – install wing covers if available. e) use control locks and tie down the aircraft if it is to be let outside. f) check for manufacturer’s recommendations for engine oil dilution.
