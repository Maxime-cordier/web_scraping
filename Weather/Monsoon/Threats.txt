Monsoon is accompanied by: Heavy Rains - significant reduction of friction on the runway, risk of take-off rejection or aquaplaning after touchdown and so risk of runway excursion.. Strong Winds - depending on runway layout may create a significant crosswind component.. Severe Turbulence - impeding altitude/pitch/airspeed hold, increasing aircraft structure fatigue and passenger discomfort.. Reduced Visibility.. Reduced ATM System Capacity..
