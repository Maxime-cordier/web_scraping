La Ni単a is defined as abnormally high sea temperatures in the western Pacific ocean. This event, the opposite of El Ni単o, often follows an El Ni単o event. With La Ni単a, the waters of the western Pacific become a lot warmer than usual and the upwelling of cold waters along the west coast of South America becomes more pronounced than usual. This affects climatic conditions around the globe and can result in significantly increased monsoon rains over India.
