An ice cap climate is a polar climate where no mean monthly temperature exceeds 0 °C. The climate generally covers areas at high latitudes and polar regions (60–90° north and south latitude), such as Antarctica (e.g. Halley Research Station and Williams Field) and some of the northernmost islands of Canada and Russia. Most of Greenland is under the influence of an ice cap climate, although the coasts are prone to more influence from the sea. Some regions on the islands of the Svalbard Archipelago facilitate an EF climate. Areas with ice cap climates are normally covered by a permanent layer of ice and have no vegetation.
