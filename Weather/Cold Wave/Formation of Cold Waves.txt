In the Northern Hemisphere, cold waves occur when very cold, dense air near the surface moves out of its source region in northern Canada or northern Asia. The core of a cold wave at the surface is a strong high-pressure center that forms during winter in high latitudes. Cold polar or Arctic air masses are relatively shallow, extending one to several km above the surface. The surface high-pressure center of the cold air is accompanied with a upper-level convergence. The most extreme area of all is northern Asia (Siberia), where the formation of cold surface air is enhanced by the large distance to the nearest unfrozen ocean, isolating the area from warmth and moisture, and the presence of mountains to the east and south, serving as barriers to trap and further isolate the cold surface air once it has formed.
