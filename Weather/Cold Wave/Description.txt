A cold wave is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. A cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24 hour period. The precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year. Usually cold waves are measured by the difference from the normal temperature. Cold waves generally are capable of occurring at any geological location and are formed by large cool air masses that accumulate over certain regions, caused by movements of air streams. Cold waves affect much larger areas than blizzards, ice storms, and other winter hazards. The “wave” in cold wave is apparent in the upper-air flow (the jet stream), which is usually amplified into a strong ridge-trough pattern during a major cold outbreak. The cold wave can negatively impact the safety of aviation operations. To mention some of the most significant issues associated with cold wave: Ice and frost accretion on the critical external surfaces of an aircraft.. Extremely cold temperatures can stress the metal aircraft surfaces.. Vehicle batteries are strained and diesel fuel gels in extreme cold weather which could have a negative impact on ground operations, etc..
