A characteristic of this cloud is Coronae - one or more coloured rings around the sun or moon when viewed from below the cloud. Ac comprising small, but distinctive, cumuliform clouds indicates rapidly forming mid level cloud in unstable conditions (Ac Castellanus). In these circumstances, the vertical development of the cloud may be sufficient to produce light precipitation or virga (light rain which does not reach the surface).
