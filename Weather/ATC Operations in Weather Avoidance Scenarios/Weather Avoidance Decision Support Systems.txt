It is generally agreed that decision support tools may be instrumental in the management of convective weather avoidance scenarios in congested airspace. Such tools will use the weather forecasts to estimate the impact on ATC provision and consequently suggest air traffic management strategies. In research funded by NASA Ames Research Centre, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory has developed an en-route Convective Weather Avoidance Model that outputs three-dimensional weather avoidance fields. “The probabilistic Weather Avoidance Fields identify regions of airspace that pilots are likely to avoid due to the presence of convective weather” (for details see Further Reading). The concept for the future trajectory-based operations is that it will be necessary to automatically generate flight trajectories through or around convective weather that pilots will find acceptable.
