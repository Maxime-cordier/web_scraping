Freezing Fog will leave only a thin film of frost or rime ice on an aircraft, which nevertheless needs to be removed before flight with a de-icing treatment. Aircraft should also receive an anti-ice treatment before commencing a take-off if freezing fog conditions exist for the taxi and take-off phases of flight in order to prevent further build-up of ice.
