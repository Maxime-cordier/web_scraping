There are four categories of green flashes: inferior mirage, mock mirage, subduct flash and green ray. Nearly all green-flash sightings fall into the first two categories. Inferior mirage flashes are oval and flat and occur close to sea level when the surface of the water is warmer than the air above it. Mock mirage flashes, on the other hand, occur higher up in the sky and when conditions on the surface are colder than the air above. The flashes appear to be thin, pointy strips being sliced from the sun, and they last about 1 to 2 seconds. These are the types of green flash most commonly seen by pilots. Subduct flashes are created when the sun appears to form an hourglass shape due to a phenomenon called atmospheric inversion, which occurs when a layer of warm air traps cool air and moisture close to the ground. In this rare circumstance, the upper section of the sun may appear green for up to 15 seconds. The rarest type of green flash is known as a green ray. In this instance, a beam of green light shoots straight up a few degrees from the green flash immediately after the sun sets for about a second. It's caused by the combination of hazy air and an unusually bright inferior, mock or subduct green flash.
