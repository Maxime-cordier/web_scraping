Shortly after the first version of the software suite was released, work began on extending that version to support new International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards. ECCAIRS was based on ICAO ADREP (Accident/Incident Data Reporting) system taxonomy, which is a set of definitions and descriptions used during the gathering and reporting of accident/incident data to ICAO. In 2003, the ICAO ADREP database was converted to ECCAIRS 4. ICAO and other organisations offer training in how to use ECCAIRS.
