If used properly, flight simulators can help investigators gain a better understanding of what happened during the occurrence through the eyes of the participants. It should be noted, however, that the use of simulators is subject to certain limitations. Some situations can be simulated better than others. The investigator needs to be fully aware of the limitations and use other appropriate methods to supplement the simulator results. Simulators are very useful for: Examples of situations where simulators are of limited value are: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly refered to as drones, provide investigators with a number of options and advantages, e.g.: One of the most useful features of drone pictures is the ability to combine them into an orthomosaic image (corrected for both perspective and scale, which has the same lack of distortion as a map) or a 3-d model of the site.
