This article gives an overview of the best practices used in aviation occurrence investigation. It also describes the use of some specific equipment, like UAVs and flight simulators, in the process, along with their benefits and limitations. As a general rule, the investigation should be unbiased (i.e. find out what has happened as opposed to proving one's assumptions). based on a Just Culture approach (i.e. focus on the lessons to be learned rather than on the person to be punished). Specific techniques (and relevant rationale) for conducting certain parts of the investigation are provided in the following sections. The advise given is derived from shared experience and common sense and is therefore not intended to supplement or supersede relevant local instructions and procedures.
