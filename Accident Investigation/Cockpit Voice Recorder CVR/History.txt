The earliest CVRs used analog wire recording, later replaced by analog magnetic tape. Some of the tape units used two reels, with the tape automatically reversing at each end. Currently, the most widely used CVRs in commercial transportation are capable of recording 4 channels of audio data for a period of 2 hours. The previous requirement for a CVR to record for 30 minutes was found to be insufficient in many cases. In some accident investigations, significant parts of the pertinent audio data were missing as they occurred more than 30 minutes before the end of the recording (the tape capacity would result in audio information being overwritten every 30 min.) The latest CVR use solid-state memory and digital recording techniques which make them much more resistant to shock, vibration and moisture. With the reduced power requirements of solid-state recorders, it is possible to incorporate a battery in the units, so that recording can continue until flight termination, even if the aircraft electrical system fails. Regarding the introduction of video recordings in the cockpit: the attempts of some operators to introduce on-board video recording in the flight deck have met very little success to date due to resistance from pilot professional organisations and unions.
