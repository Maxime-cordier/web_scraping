Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention — Aircraft Accident Investigation - contains Standards which require Contracting States to report to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) information on all aircraft accidents which involve aircraft of a maximum certificated take-off mass of over 2 250 kg. The Organisation also gathers information on aircraft incidents considered important for safety and accident prevention. The Accident/Incident Data Reporting (ADREP) system is operated and maintained by ICAO. The ADREP system receives, stores and provides States with occurrence data that will assist them in validating safety. In this context, the term ‘occurrence’ includes both accidents and incidents. The system was established in 1976 but has evolved to meet changes in information technology and the aviation industry. The version of the ADREP system in current use is ADREP 2000.
