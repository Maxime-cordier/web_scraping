The ADREP system operates using a software platform developed by the European Union (EU) - the European Co-ordination Centre for Aviation Incident Reporting System (ECCAIRS). This platform was adopted for ADREP use in 2004. The same software is also made available to States (free of charge) by the EU through ICAO to support the development of their own reporting systems, and to facilitate the electronic transfer of occurrence report information through software compatibility. In addition to the collection, storage and exchange of occurrence data, ADREP/ECCAIRS also provides users with the capability to exchange analysis tools. As a result, States establishing occurrence reporting systems in accordance with Standard 8.1 of Annex 13 can benefit from analysis tools developed elsewhere. As of January 2009, some 45 States and 7 international organizations have installed the ECCAIRS software and have reported occurrences in the ECCAIRS format to ICAO. This process has permitted ICAO to have more complete and up-to-date data, and it will continue to benefit the States as there will no longer be a need for them to complete the ICAO ADREP reporting forms manually. In addition, closer cooperation through electronic communications with data providers has improved the classification of occurrences.
