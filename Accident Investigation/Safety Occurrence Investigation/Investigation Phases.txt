The investigation process is triggered by a notification (report) submitted in accordance with the established safety occurrence reporting arrangements. Several basic phases of an investigation can be distinguished: Identifying the lessons to be learned from a safety occurrence requires an understanding of not just what happened, but why it happened. Therefore, the investigation should look beyond the obvious causes and aim to identify all the contributory factors, some of which may be related to weaknesses in the system’s defences or other organisational issues. For maximum effectiveness, the outcome of the investigation should focus on determining hazards and risks and not on identifying individuals to blame and punish. The way the investigation is conducted influences the overall safety culture in the aviation service provider organisation. According to Council Directive 94/56/EC the investigation ”shall in no case be concerned with appointing blame or liability”. Also, according to EU-OPS 1.037 the objective of the accident prevention and flight safety programmes run by aircraft operators shall be the “evaluation of relevant information relating to accidents and incidents and the promulgation of related information, but not the attribution of blame”.
