According to the provisions laid down in International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Annex 13 - Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation, States shall investigate or delegate the investigation of accidents which have occurred in their territory. Serious incidents should be investigated by States or by other organisations, such as dedicated accident/incident investigation bodies or aviation service provider organisations. According to Regulation (EU) No 996/2010 on the investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation “every accident or serious incident involving aircraft other than those specified in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 shall be the subject of a safety investigation”. The investigation of incidents, other than serious incidents, is also encouraged as this will enable drawing of safety lessons. The ICAO divisional meeting on Accident Investigation and Prevention held in Montreal in October 2008 proposed a change in Annex 13 to foster a more proactive approach towards the prevention of accidents. It is proposed that States be mandated to investigate serious incidents by upgrading the current ‘recommended practice’ to a ‘standard’ to be applicable to serious incidents involving aircraft with a maximum mass limit of over 2 250 kg. EUROCONTROL ESARR 2 mandates the investigation of safety occurrences in ATM which occur in the States in which in is applicable.
