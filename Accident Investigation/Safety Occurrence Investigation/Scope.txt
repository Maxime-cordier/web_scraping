According to the EU Council Directive 94/56/EC “The extent of investigations and the procedure to be followed in carrying out such investigations shall be determined by the investigating body, taking into account the principles and the objective of this Directive and depending on the lessons it expects to draw from the accident or serious incident for the improvement of safety”. The extent of an investigation should depend on the actual or potential consequence or hazard. Incidents that indicate high risk potential should be investigated in greater depth than those with lower risk potential. Although the investigation should primarily focus on the factors that are most likely to have influenced action, the dividing line between relevance and irrelevance is often blurred. Data that initially may seem to be unrelated could later prove to be relevant once the relationship between the different elements of an occurrence are better understood. Investigation and analysis of safety occurrences is an essential ingredient of the overall risk management process in aviation. Effective safety management systems largely depend on the quality of the investigation of reported accidents, incidents and safety issues.
