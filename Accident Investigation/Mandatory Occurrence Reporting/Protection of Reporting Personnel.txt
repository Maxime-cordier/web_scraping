The objective of mandatory occurrence reporting is to prevent safety occurrences, such as accidents and incidents, not to attribute blame or liability if they happen. The person filing a safety report needs to have the strong assurance from the regulatory authority and the employer that prosecution or punitive actions such as suspension of licence will not be sought unless the unsafe act is deliberately committed or gross negligence is demonstrated. Such assurance includes confidentiality of reporting and sole use of reported data for safety improvement. Protecting identities in the reports is a good practice adopted by many States, and further made compulsory in Europe by Regulation (EU) No 376/2014. A positive safety culture in the organisation creates the kind of trust necessary for a successful occurrence reporting system. The culture must be error-tolerant and just. In addition, the reporting system needs to be perceived as being fair in the way unintentional errors and mistakes are treated. A Just Culture implies that, as far as possible: Reports will be confidential;. Prosecution or punishment will not follow reports of unpremeditated or accidental breaches of regulations;. Employers will not take punitive action following reports of unpremeditated or accidental breaches of regulations or procedures..
