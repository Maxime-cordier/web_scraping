Once the safety report is received, the information must be stored in a manner suitable for easy retrieval, investigation and analysis. States and their regulated entities should establish a database for this purpose. Most aircraft operators, ANSPs, aerodrome operators and maintenance organisations have established their own internal safety reporting systems and databases which they use to record and analyse all occurrences affecting the safety of the services they provide, regardless of whether such occurrences must also be reported to national investigators or regulators. Many regulators require that only serious occurrences are reported to them, leaving lesser matters to be dealt with locally by the aircraft operators and service provider organisations. This practice, which relies on mutual trust, enables the prompt identification of trends and incident precursors, and the establishment of defensive measures at an early point. In general, internal investigations of safety occurrences take less time than the investigations carried out by civil aviation administrations or Air Accident Investigation Bureaux due to the lower severity of investigated occurrences and, consequently, limited investigation scope.
