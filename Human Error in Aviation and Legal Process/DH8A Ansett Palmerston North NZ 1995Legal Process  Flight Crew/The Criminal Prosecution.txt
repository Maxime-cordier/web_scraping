The Captain was charged with three counts of unlawfully injuring passengers.. The Plea(s): Not guilty Prosecutors Sentencing Request: Imprisonment Significant aspects of the trial: 6 weeks trial. CVR used against the pilot.. As part of the criminal enquiry, the police requested that the Accident Investigation Commission provide them with actual CVR tape, not just a transcript of the recording, but the Commission refused to do so. The matter went to the High Court and the court ruled that the CVR was inadmissible in court. The matter went to the Court of Appeal and the 5 judge bench overturned this ruling and held that the police did have the right to obtain the actual CVR. The police executed the search warrant and took possession of the CVR tape.. In September 1999 legislation was passed prohibiting the use of flight recorders in criminal or civil proceedings against pilots (Flight Safety Foundation, 2000) The Judgement: The captain was later acquitted of all charges. The Sentence(s): Exemplary damages for compensation. The claims of the families of those who were killed, against Ansett for compensatory damages were dismissed by the court as statutorily barred by New Zealand's accident compensation scheme, but their claims against Ansett for exemplary damages were allowed to go forward, as these claims were not barred by the Act..
