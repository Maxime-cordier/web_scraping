Flight 703, an Ansett DHC-8 scheduled to fly from Auckland Airport to Palmerston North, crashed west of the Taratua Ranges and 16 km east of Palmerston North airport, during an instrument approach in bad weather. During the approach to a right turn which would place the aircraft on final approach to runway 25, the right landing gear failed to fully extend and the co-pilot began to manually extend it using a hydraulic pump. The aircraft's power settings had already been reduced to Flight Idle which was normal, but the aircraft was inadvertently allowed to descend too low toward the undulating terrain leading into Palmerston North. Although Ansett New Zealand Flight 703's Ground Proximity Warning System sounded an alarm four seconds before the aircraft hit the ground, the crew was unable to avoid the accident. According to the Transport Accident Investigation Commission report an audio alarm of "Terrain! Terrain! Pull up!" should have sounded 17 seconds before impact, but the GPWS malfunctioned, for reasons which have never been determined. There were 3 crew members and 18 passengers on board the aircraft. All passengers, except for one United States citizen, were New Zealand citizens. One crew member and 3 passengers lost their lives and the other two crew members and 12 passengers were seriously injured. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
