Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) for the State Investigation of Aircraft Accidents and Serious Incidents are provided by Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention). Annex 13 invites States to seek a rational relationship between their obligation to promote aviation safety and their administration of justice. Legal guidance regarding the protection of information from safety data collection and processing systems can be found at Attachment E of Annex 13.
