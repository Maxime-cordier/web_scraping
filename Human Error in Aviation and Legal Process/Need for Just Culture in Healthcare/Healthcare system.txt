Healthcare is a risky business. While the maxim ‘first, do no harm’ is a fundamentally important precept, and the aim of a ‘zero harm’ care environment is a laudable one, no healthcare system will ever be completely harm free. How the needs and interests of patients and professionals are managed in the aftermath of healthcare harm is therefore a significant, but largely overlooked, aspect of care quality. Medication errors continue to be a concern of healthcare providers and the public, in particular how to prevent harm from medication mistakes. Many healthcare workers are afraid to report errors for fear of retribution including the loss of professional licensure and even imprisonment. For example if a healthcare professional makes an error that causes no harm we consider them to be lucky. If another person makes the same error resulting in injury to a patient we consider them to be blameworthy and disciplinary action may follow. The more severe the outcome, the more blameworthy the person becomes. This is a flawed system based upon the notion that we can totally control our outcomes.
