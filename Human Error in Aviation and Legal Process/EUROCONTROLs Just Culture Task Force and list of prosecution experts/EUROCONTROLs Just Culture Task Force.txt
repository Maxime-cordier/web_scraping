Over the last few years, EUROCONTROL has championed developments in this crucial safety area with a dedicated EUROCONTROL Just Culture Task Force (JCTF). The Task Force is a group with a wide membership from aviation, rail, maritime and healthcare, as well as members of the judiciary, meeting regularly under the auspices of EUROCONTROL. Since 2007, JCTF has been promoting debate about the legal questions relating to safety and justice, to foster and support dialogue between safety and judicial experts, and to develop relevant guidance material and policies in order to support the implementation and dissemination of a Just Culture concept in consideration of the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) 376/2014. The JCTF has developed a “model policy” regarding criminal investigation and prosecution of criminal offences further to the reporting of civil aviation incidents and accidents. The objective of this policy is to provide direction regarding the criminal investigation and prosecution of potential criminal offences resulting from aviation accidents or which come to the attention of prosecutors through the reporting of civil aviation incidents. Together with the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations (IFATCA) and the European Cockpit Association (ECA), EUROCONTROL has devised and delivered special Just Culture courses for aviation experts and prosecutors. These courses are designed to train local experts to assist the judiciary, if they so request, while also providing members of the judiciary (judges and prosecutors) with insights to the civil aviation safety.
