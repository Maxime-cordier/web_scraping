Although a visual approach is the first type of approach taught to student pilots, it has its own inherent risks and liabilities. Careful consideration should be given to all pertinent factors before flying a visual approach in preference to an instrument procedure, especially at an unfamiliar airport. The Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) Approach-and-landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) Briefing Note 7.4 makes the following recommendation: "Accepting an air traffic control (ATC) clearance for a visual approach or requesting a visual approach should be balanced carefully against the following: Ceiling and visibility conditions;. Darkness (light levels);. Weather:. Wind, turbulence;. Rain or snow; and/or,. Fog or smoke;. Crew experience with airport and airport environment:. Surrounding terrain; and/or,. Specific airport and runway hazards (obstructions, etc.); and,. Runway visual aids: Type of approach light system (ALS); and, Availability of visual approach slope indicator system (VASIS) or precision approach path indicator (PAPI).". Type of approach light system (ALS); and,. Availability of visual approach slope indicator system (VASIS) or precision approach path indicator (PAPI).". The specific focus of this article is on the risks and illusions associated with visual approaches at night.
