Examples of CFIT precursors that have been identified are listed below. By definition, this list cannot be exhaustive and continuous efforts must be made to identify other precursors. GPWS/TAWS alert/warning (genuine, nuisance or false). MSAW warning. Other cases of reduced terrain separation. Prolonged loss of communication (PLOC) between pilot and controller(s). Low-energy state during approach. Land short (runway undershoot) event. Low altitude pattern following a go-around. Inappropriate low altitude manoeuvring. Low-on-fuel condition/fuel starvation. Low pitch attitude/shallow flight path/altitude loss after lift-off. Flight below desired profile path during climb. Lateral deviation during climb (SID). Descent/flight below segment or sector safe altitude. Altimeter setting error. Failure to check navigation accuracy before approach. Lateral deviation during approach (STAR). Failure to revert to navaids raw data in case of doubts on automation. Incorrect or inappropriate radar vectoring by ATC (i.e., below minimum vectoring altitude (MVA) and/or toward high terrain). Premature descent to the next step-down altitude during a multiple-steps-down non-precision approach. DME confusion (non-collocated DME versus ILS-DME), in identifying the final descent point. Premature descent to DA(H) before G/S intercept or premature descent to MDA(H) before final descent-point/FAF. Premature descent below MDA(H) before reaching the visual descent-point (VDP). Flight below desired flight path during initial and/or final approach. Continued approach, when below DA(H) or MDA(H), after loss of visual references. Late or inadequate response to GPWS/TAWS alert/warning. Late or inadequate response to MSAW warning. Late or inadequate response to windshear warning. Unstabilized approach (steep or shallow approach). Failure to go-around. Lack of effective flight path control during go-around. Failure to follow published missed-approach procedure. Inadequate fuel management.
