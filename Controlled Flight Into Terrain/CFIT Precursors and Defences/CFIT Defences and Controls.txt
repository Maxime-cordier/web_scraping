Identification of accident precursors is only half the battle; it is also necessary to define and implement defences and control strategies to address the threats involved. Listed below are defence or control strategies that have been identified: Industry prevention strategies and best practices (See also Further Reading). Adherence to SOPs (task sharing, briefings, use of checklists, standard calls and excessive-deviation callouts, mutual crosscheck and backup). Cross-check of takeoff data: mass and balance, fuel distribution, wind component, runway conditions, flaps setting, V1/Vr speeds, etc.. Adherence to sterile-cockpit rule. Adopting the constant-angle non-precision approach (CANPA)/constant descent final-approach (CDFA) concept. Use of an aircraft/airport-specific Engine Out Standard Instrument Departure (EOSID) in case of engine failure. Adequate use and supervision of automation. Vertical and horizontal flight paths monitoring (situational and energy awareness). Altimeter setting cross-check. Cross-checking cleared altitude versus minimum safe altitude. Timely and adequate response to GPWS/TAWS alert or warning. Timely and adequate response to MSAW warning. Timely and adequate response to windshear alert or warning. Awareness of minimum vectoring altitudes. Awareness of approach design criteria (PANS-OPS versus TERPS). Awareness of relationship between track distance to runway threshold and height (300 ft/nm rule-of-thumb). Awareness of low-OAT correction to be added to minimum approach altitudes/heights. Awareness of minimum safe radio-altimeter readings for each approach segment (IAF-IF, IF-FAF). Awareness of "black-hole" or other visual illusions for prevailing approach. Timely go-around. Adherence to published missed-approach procedure. Use of available aircraft technologies for enhanced situation awareness (vertical situation display, head-up display, enhanced-vision, etc.).
