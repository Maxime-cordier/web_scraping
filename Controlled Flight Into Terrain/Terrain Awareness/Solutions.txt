According to the briefing note, "Terrain-awareness elements of effective cross-check and backup include: Assertive challenging. Altitude calls. Excessive parameter-deviation calls; and,. Task-sharing and standard calls for the acquisition of visual references.. "Terrain awareness can be improved by correct use of the radio altimeter. The barometric-altimeter bug and the radio altimeter decision height (RA DH) bug must be set according to the aircraft manufacturer’s SOPs or the company’s SOPs." An important element of monitoring is ensuring that the correct altimeter pressure setting is set. The States are required by ICAO Annex 15 (Chapter 10) to provide electronic terrain and obstacle data (eTOD) for the use in different air navigation applications including GPWS, MSAW, flight simulators, electronic charts etc.
