It is important that if a high/low energy state approach prompts a decision to go-around, the flight crew must commit to completing the go-around and not subsequently change the decision in an attempt to land. (A change of decision is often observed when the decision to go-around is initiated by the first officer (as PF) but is overridden by the captain.) Runway overruns, runway overshoots, collisions with terrain and obstructions often are the consequences of decision to land after a go-around is initiated. The only Go Around you will ever really regret is the one that you did not do when you should have done.
