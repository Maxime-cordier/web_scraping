The ‘PULL UP’ audio and visual ‘Hard’ warning generated by TAWS or GPWS systems is an absolutely vital safety net. Every pilot should understand that their response should be rapid and instinctive. Such a callout is not a time to ask the question 'why?' or to ever assume that the activation might be a false one. Provided that the database it contains is kept up to date, and the equipment is provided with accurate position data by internal or external GPS feed, any correctly functioning TAWS system will provide a reliable protection against inadvertent closure with terrain, or an obstruction, provided that the response is appropriate. Since the older GPWS systems do not have a position feed or a terrain database, the ‘PULL UP’ Warnings which they generate may not be enough to prevent terrain impact even if actioned properly. However, an appropriate response still represents the best course of action and the most significant chance of survival.
