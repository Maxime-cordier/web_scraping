The aircraft altimeter barometric sub-scale must be set to the appropriate setting for the phase of flight. These are: Flight level. Standard pressure setting (1013 hPa) is set when flying by reference to flight levels at or above the transition level;. Altitude. Regional or airfield pressure setting (QNH) is set when flying by reference to altitude above mean sea level at or below the transition altitude;. Height. Altimeter pressure setting indicating height above airfield or touchdown (QFE) is set when approaching to land at airfield where this procedure is in use. Note that this setting is not used in other portions of the flight (climb, cruise and initial descent).. Aircraft are not supposed to fly level within the transition layer (between the transition altitude and the transition level). When passing through it, their vertical position is expressed in: flight levels during climb (i.e. above the transition altitude). altitudes during descent (i.e. below the transition level). If no transition altitude and transition level are defined (which is common for en-route flights outside the TMAs), the vertical position of aircraft shall be expressed in terms of: flight levels at or above the lowest usable flight level. altitudes below the lowest usable flight level. Failure to set the appropriate barometric sub-scale pressure setting may result in a significant deviation from the cleared altitude or Flight Level
