Figure 2 illustrates the Continuous Descent Final Approach (CDFA) concept. The path of the aircraft is again coloured red and the standard non-precision approach path is coloured blue for comparison purposes. The aircraft crosses the FAF at, or above, the published crossing altitude and then descends at a constant rate, or constant angle (dependent upon aircraft equipment) which, if continued below the MDH, would result in it crossing the runway threshold in a position to land the aircraft. A simple calculation, based on distance, height to lose and ground speed, is necessary to determine the rate of descent required. With aircraft capable of maintaining a desired Flight Path Angle (FPA) or using GNSS navigation capability, the CDFA is refined further such that the resulting constant angle approach path will cross the MDH at the Visual Descent Point (VDP). In virtually all cases, the CDFA procedures consider the MDH as a decision altitude (DA) and, if the runway is not in sight when the aircraft reaches the MDH, a go-around must be flown. Note that some regulators require that a buffer be added to the MDH when using it as a DA for a CDFA so that descent below the published MDH does not occur during initiation of the go-around procedure. Many regulators will require an operator to obtain an Operations Specification (Ops Spec) for conducting CDFA procedures and all will insist that the Operations Manual and the operator training programmes provide the appropriate level of guidance to the flight crews.
