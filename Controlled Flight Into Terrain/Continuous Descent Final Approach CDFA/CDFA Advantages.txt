CDFA offers the following advantages: Increased safety by employing the concepts of stabilised approach criteria and procedure standardisation.. Improved pilot situational awareness (SA) and reduced pilot workload.. Improved fuel efficiency by minimizing the low-altitude level flight time.. Reduced noise level by minimising the level flight time at high thrust settings.. Procedural similarities to approach procedure with vertical guidance (APV) and precision approach operations.. Reduced probability of infringement on required obstacle clearance during the final approach segment..
