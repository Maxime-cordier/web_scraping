Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) is a primary cause of worldwide commercial aviation fatal accidents. Unstabilized approaches are a key contributor to CFIT events. If the NPA is flown in the traditional fashion, step down fixes will require multiple thrust, pitch, and altitude adjustments inside the final approach fix (FAF). These adjustments increase both the pilot workload and the potential for error during a critical phase of flight. NPAs designed without step down fixes in the final segment allow pilots to immediately descend to the MDA after crossing the FAF. In both cases however, the aircraft must remain at the MDA until commencing final descent for the runway or reaching the missed approach point (MAP). This practice can result in extended level flight at altitudes as low as 250 feet above the ground in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and shallow or steep final approaches once the runway is in sight. The overall result is that a traditionally flown NPA makes it very difficult to achieve a stabilised approach and smooth transition to visual flight. Additionally, landing attempted at or near the missed approach point due to late runway acquisition could be extremely dangerous due to the excessively steep approach angle. Many CFIT accidents occur during non-precision approaches.
