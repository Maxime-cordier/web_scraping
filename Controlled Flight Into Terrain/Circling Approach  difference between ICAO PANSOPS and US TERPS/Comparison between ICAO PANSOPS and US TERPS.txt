Aerodrome operating minima (AOM) are calculated by operators based on information supplied by national authorities in their AIPs. This information typically consists of approach and departure procedures which assure safe separation between the aircraft and known obstacles located close to the intended flight path of the procedure in question. The procedures themselves are based on obstacle clearance domains constructed using internationally accepted standards. Two main sets of procedures exist: Pilots should be aware that there are differences in obstacle clearance criteria between procedures designed in accordance with ICAO PANS-OPS and US TERPS. This is especially true in respect of Circling Approaches where the assumed radius of turn and minimum obstacle clearance are markedly different (see below).
