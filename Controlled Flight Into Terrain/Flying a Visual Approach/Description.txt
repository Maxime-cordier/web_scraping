Although a visual approach is the first type of approach normally taught to student pilots in light aircraft, this type of approach may be hazardous and careful consideration should be given before flying a visual approach in preference to an instrument approach, especially in a large aircraft. It is helpful for pilots to be very familiar with the attitudes and power settings expected in their aircraft on a normal stabilised approach so that any deviation from those expected values can help with identification of either an inappropriate approach path or an un-stabilised approach. Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) Approach-and-landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) Briefing Note 7.4 â€” Visual Approach makes the following recommendation: "Accepting an air traffic control (ATC) clearance for a visual approach or requesting a visual approach should be balanced carefully against the following: Make sure that if you accept a clearance for a visual approach you understand completely what responsibilities you are now accepting and what ATC expect of you. Also be aware of what actions ATC in countries other than your home operating environment would expect from you in the event of a Missed Approach. For example in the USA a visual approach is an IFR clearance but is not an instrument approach procedure therefore it has no Missed Approach segment. (FAA AIM 5-4-23 FAA InFO 11003 Visual Approaches). You would probably be expected to remain clear of cloud until issued a further clearance by ATC. Flying the published instrument approach missed approach procedure after a visual approach can cause alarm all round and has lead in the past to close encounters with other traffic.
