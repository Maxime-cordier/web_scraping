"Resisting the tendency to pitch down or to descend intentionally below the appropriate altitude is the greatest challenge during the visual segment of the approach. This includes: Pitching down toward the approach lights in an attempt to see the runway during a precision approach; or,. Descending prematurely because of the incorrect perception of being too high.". "The pilot not flying (PNF) must maintain instrument references, including glideslope deviation, during the visual portion of an ILS approach." "Monitoring the VASI or PAPI, whenever available, provides additional visual references to resist the tendency to increase or to decrease the rate of descent." "The following can counter visual illusions (and prevent a flight crew from descending prematurely): Maintain an instrument scan down to touchdown;. Cross-check instrument indications against outside visual references to confirm glide path;. Use an ILS approach whenever available;. Use a VASI or PAPI, if available, down to runway threshold; and,. Use other available tools, such as an extended runway centerline shown on the flight management system (FMS) navigation display, ILS-DME (distance measuring equipment) or VOR (very-high-frequency omnidirectional radio)-DME distance, altitude above airport elevation to confirm the glide path (based on a typical 300-feet/one-nautical-mile approach gradient).".
