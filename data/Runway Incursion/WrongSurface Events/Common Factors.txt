Event investigations cited by FAA reveal some common factors. Airports with parallel runways are prone to wrong-surface landings. Parallel runways with different dimensions and/or surface colour may confuse pilots, and offset parallel runways also have proven problematic, with pilots erroneously landing on the more prominent of the surfaces. Other factors cited included pilot “expectation bias” that leads them to identify the runway they are expecting versus the runway assigned by air traffic control, as well as fatigue, cockpit distractions, visual illusions, wrong visual cues and reduced situational awareness.
