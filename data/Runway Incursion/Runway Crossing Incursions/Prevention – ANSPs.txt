A number of complimentary measures could help reduce runway crossing incursions: The issue of a clearance to cross an active runway should always be given directly by the runway controller on the single frequency used for all clearances to access a particular active runway for any purpose.. Only one language should be in use for all communications on the frequency designated for use by a runway controller.. Where OJT is in progress, procedures should require that all active runway crossing clearances are specifically monitored by the qualified training controller.. Unambiguous procedures to cover any malfunction of stop bar lighting at runway holding points should be in place.. Consideration should be given to the most appropriate way(s) to ensure that the prevailing use of controllable stop bar lighting in support of taxi clearances is effectively communicated to aircraft using an aerodrome.. If runway crossing is permitted when alternative but less efficient alternatives exist, the circumstances when it is permitted and the process to be followed should be established.. Arrangements for the display to runway controllers of active runway occupancy by aircraft or vehicles should include runway crossing clearances.. All holding points or positions at which runway crossing is permitted should have an unrestricted line of sight from the runway control position or equivalent CCTV coverage.. Exceptional vigilance is required if vehicles or aircraft on one runway are instructed to hold clear of an intersecting runway to await crossing clearance if, as is likely, there are no holding point markings or associated lighting to indicate a specific holding position.. Systems which alert controllers to potential or actual runway incursions should incorporate an audio alert as well as a visual representation of the location and opposing traffic..
