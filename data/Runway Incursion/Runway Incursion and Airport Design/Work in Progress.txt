When planning and carrying out work in progress on the manoeuvring area the aerodrome operator should: Ensure in the design stage that the changed layout does not increase the likelihood of runway incursions;. Ensure that the layout changes are published in the AIP, NOTAMs or ATIS and local airfield notices in a timely fashion as appropriate;. Ensure that the airfield signs, lights and markings are altered to reflect the changed layout;. Ensure that air traffic control are aware of the changes;. Ensure that the ground lighting and any associated control software are altered to reflect the new layout e.g. availability of green taxiway centre line lights linked to an unserviceable stop bar should not occur..
