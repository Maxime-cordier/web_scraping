A dedicated study has concluded that: ATCO detection after alert from the use of input and display of the ATC clearances and surveillance data (ITWP) is likely to be the most effective ATC tool in the prevention and mitigation of runway incursions and ground safety events. This functionality is not yet widely available; however, this study does lend strong support.. Proactive alerts from pilots and drivers that lead to ATC detection and resolution are likely to be very important barriers, especially in reducing the risk of collision in runway incursions.. ATC direct visual detection and the use of A-SMGCS level 2 are both strong barriers in the prevention and mitigation of runway events.. ATC detection of incorrect runway presence, using remote camera displays is a strong mitigation barrier as it does not necessarily depend on good visibility and line of sight.. ATC memory aids are likely to be strong barriers that aid ATC perception and memory. It is these areas of ATC action however that fail most often in actual events.. The barrier that halted actual safety events most often was acting upon alerts received from pilots and drivers. The study therefore supports initiatives such as Local Runway Safety Teams in promoting the “one team ethos”.. The barriers that were breached most often were: ATCO Direct Visual Detection;. ATC Memory Aids;. belated (last-minute) ATCO Direct Visual Detection;. ATCO detection with A-SMGCS level 1.. The barriers that most often successfully stopped the event were: ATCO resolution after pilot/driver alert;. belated (last-minute) ATCO Visual Detection;. belated (last-minute) pilot detection..
