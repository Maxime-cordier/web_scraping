Controllers memory aids are used to assist the controller in maintaining situational awareness. These require manual input. The most common memory aids are: Flight strip positioning rules – placing flight strips in specific locations according to the clearances issued;. Electronic or handwritten marks on the flight strips (e.g. a tick when a landing clearance is given);. Switches – a simple on/off switch with a corresponding sign (e.g. “runway occupied”) might be useful for maintaining situational awareness and the controller remembering that a clearance has been given to the (approaching) aircraft..
