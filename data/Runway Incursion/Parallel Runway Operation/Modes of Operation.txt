In ATC terms, the various modes of operation available for the use of parallel or near-parallel instrument runways are distinguished as: Mode 1, independent parallel approaches: simultaneous approaches to parallel instrument runways where radar separation minima are not prescribed between aircraft using adjacent ILS; and. Mode 2, dependent parallel approaches: simultaneous approaches to parallel instrument runways where radar separation minima between aircraft using adjacent ILS are prescribed.. Mode 3, independent parallel departures: simultaneous departures for aircraft departing in the same direction from parallel runways.. It should be noted that when the spacing between two parallel runways is lower than the specified value determined by wake turbulence considerations, the runways are considered as a single runway with regard to vortex wake separation. Mode 4, segregated parallel operations: simultaneous operations on parallel runways where one runway is used for approaches and landings, and one runway is used for departures.. In the case of segregated parallel approaches and departures there may be semi-mixed modes of operations. One runway is used exclusively for approaches while approaches are being made to the other runway, or departures are in progress on the other runway.. One runway is used exclusively for departures while other is used for both departures and arrivals.. At least one runway is used for both take offs and landings.
