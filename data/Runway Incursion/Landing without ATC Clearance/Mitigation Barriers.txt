The barriers that may mitigate the consequences of landing without clearance can be combined in two groups: Conflict detection (the risk of conflict was identified early enough and proper action was taken): Visually by the controller; With a system support tool by the controller; Visually or while monitoring the audio channel by the flight crew/vehicle driver.. Visually by the controller;. With a system support tool by the controller;. Visually or while monitoring the audio channel by the flight crew/vehicle driver.. Conflict resolution (the conflict could not be prevented but was detected and properly resolved): By the controller after visual detection; By the controller with the help of a surveillance system; By the controller after detecting the risk with a safety net (e.g. RIMCAS); By the flight crew/vehicle driver after visual detection; By the flight crew/vehicle driver after detecting it while monitoring the frequency; By the flight crew/ground crew after detecting it with system support.. By the controller after visual detection;. By the controller with the help of a surveillance system;. By the controller after detecting the risk with a safety net (e.g. RIMCAS);. By the flight crew/vehicle driver after visual detection;. By the flight crew/vehicle driver after detecting it while monitoring the frequency;. By the flight crew/ground crew after detecting it with system support..
