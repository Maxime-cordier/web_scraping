Accident and incident reports show that misidentification of runways by pilots - and sometimes by vehicle drivers too - can be a significant factor in both accidents and serious incidents in which a runway collision risk was created. The unintended use or otherwise attempted use of parallel taxiways for both take off and landing has in the past been at least as common as Wrong Runway Use. In extreme cases, large aircraft on public transport flights have been landed on runways that are not even at the right airport. Runway misidentification can result in a runway incursion or a runway overrun and may lead to the use of a taxiway or an incorrect runway for take off or landing. Ultimately a collision with another aircraft, a vehicle or ground obstructions can create the conditions for a fatal accident.
