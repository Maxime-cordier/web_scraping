The most typical landing case involves a landing on a taxiway parallel to the correct runway, by day or by night. See for example B734, Palembang Indonesia, 2008, B732, London Gatwick UK, 1993 and B739, Akita Japan, 2007. Less often another runway at the same airport is inadvertently used; even less often, an approach - and sometimes even a landing - is made to runway with a similar orientation in the vicinity of the extended centerline of the correct runway, but at a different airport, is used, see for example B733, vicinity Belfast Aldergrove UK, 2006. A few cases where aircraft landed on a runway at the wrong airport have occurred, see for example A320, Ballykelly Northern Ireland UK, 2006.
