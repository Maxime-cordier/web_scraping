Remotely selectable Stop Bar lighting is increasingly being provided on both a 24 hour basis or just during LVP operations. When not used during normal daytime operations, it may be provided at reduced intensity for night operations. A lighted Stop Bar consists of a row of unidirectional lights embedded in the pavement and spaced equally across the taxiway at the associated holding point, normally at right angles to the centerline. It will show red towards an approaching aircraft when lit. Stop Bars are sometimes installed in association with green Lead-on Lights which are a continuation of the taxiway centreline lighting beyond the Stop Bar which guide an aircraft onto the runway centreline. Where provided, such Lead-on Lights are operated in conjunction with their preceding Stop Bar so that when the Stop Bar is red, the green centreline beyond the Stop Bar is unlit and vice versa.
