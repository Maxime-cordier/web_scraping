Air traffic controllers should pay attention when issuing clearances for multiple line-ups as the presence of more than one departing aircraft on the runway will normally lead to prolonged runway occupancy time, this is especially valid when the runway is used for mixed operations (departures and landings). There are two main cases with respect to the visibility from the ATC Tower: The controller should: maintain visual observation of the positions of the aircraft involved and verify the reported position by the flight crew, in particular when line-up is requested; and. subject to the information provided by available sources, such as visual observation, procedural, or radar surveillance display of conflicting traffic, issue, delay or deny ATC clearance to enter the runway;. when transmitting the line-up clearance, advise all concerned flight crews of the respective position of other traffic sequenced in multiple line-ups;. maintain strong awareness of the flight crew read-back.. Multiple line-ups should NOT be used when an intersection (used for line-up) is not visible to the controller. (see Doc 7030 Part 3, para. 3.1.1.a).
