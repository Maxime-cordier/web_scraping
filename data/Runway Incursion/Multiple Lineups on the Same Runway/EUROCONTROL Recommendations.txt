The European Action Plan for the Prevention of Runway Incursions (EAPPRI), includes the following advice: When using multiple line-ups, do not use oblique or angled taxiways that limit the ability of the flight crew to see the runway threshold or the final approach area.. In order to avoid an aircraft entering the runway while another is taking off, multiple line-ups are inadvisable in cases when the taxiway intersects the runway at an acute angle, thus preventing the pilots from having a good view down the runway. Such a situation classically applies if a Rapid Exit Taxiway (RET) (intended for landing aircraft use when the opposite direction of runway use applies) is used to clear departing aircraft onto the runway.. Ensure a clear and robust procedure is in place, and where practicable, appropriate technology is used to show that a runway is occupied, obstructed or unavailable.. Ensure that Air Traffic Control communication messages are not over long or complex.. Avoid infringing sight lines from the tower and assess visibility restrictions from the tower, which have a potential impact on the ability to see the runway, and disseminate this information as appropriate. Recommend improvement when possible and develop appropriate procedures.. Identify any potential hazards of runway capacity enhancing procedures when used individually or in combination and, if necessary, develop appropriate mitigation strategies. (Intersection departures, multiple line-up, conditional clearances etc.). Do not issue a line up clearance if the aircraft will be expected to wait on the runway for more than 90 seconds beyond the time it will normally be expected to depart.. Ensure that Aerodrome Operators and Air Navigation Service Providers regularly review the operational use of aeronautical ground lighting e.g. stop bars, to ensure a robust policy to protect the runway from the incorrect presence of traffic..
