Persons authorised to drive and/or operate ATC radio communications in vehicles which tow aircraft should be very carefully selected and trained by their employers, with special reference to any restricted visibility from the vehicles used and their awareness of the size of aircraft types which may be towed. The potential effect of not complying with ATC clearances when towing aircraft, or if the link between the towing vehicle and the aircraft nose landing gear fails, is clearly much greater than for a vehicle on its own.
