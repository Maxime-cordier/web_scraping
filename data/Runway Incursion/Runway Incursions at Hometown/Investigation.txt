The investigators discussed probable causes: Expectation bias - the pilots did not expect a stop bar to be lit, because they had received clearance to line up (though at another intersection!).. The turn on to intersection W6 is 150 degrees. This may make the stop bar difficult to detect.. When the pilot starts the turn, the position is close to the threshold. This may give the pilots the false impression that they are using the correct intersection..
