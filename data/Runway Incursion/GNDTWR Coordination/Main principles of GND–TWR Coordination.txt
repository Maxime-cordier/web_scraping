Although GND-TWR coordination varies from aerodrome to aerodrome there are some general principles that are implemented in most places: The TWR controller is responsible for operations on the active runway(s) and airborne aircraft within the area of responsibility of the aerodrome control tower;. Coordination between GND and TWR can be done using a variety of methods: directly, by phone, by paper strips or electronically;. The GND controller is responsible for traffic movements on the manoeuvring area with the exception of the active runway(s);. The GND controller must obtain approval from the TWR controller before clearing an aircraft or a vehicle to enter or cross an active runway;. The GND controller must inform the TWR controller that the crossing of an active runway has been completed;. The GND controller must notify the TWR controller when a departing aircraft has been taxied to a runway other than one previously designated as active;. The GND controller must notify the TWR controller of any aircraft taxied to an intersection for takeoff;. When the runway(s) in use are not visible by either of the controllers or the aircraft/vehicles using them are not visible on surveillance display (if applicable), the transferring controller must advise the receiving controller of the aircraft's/vehicleâ€™s location before releasing them..
