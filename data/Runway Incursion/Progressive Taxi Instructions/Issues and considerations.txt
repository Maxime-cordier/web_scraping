Increased workload for the air traffic controller. Giving progressive taxi instructions means that the controller should divert a lot of attention to a single flight.. "Tunnel Vision" – it is possible that the controller gets so preoccupied with one aircraft that they may neglect other situations and have their situational awareness reduced.. Increased frequency occupancy. Breaking the taxi clearance into several parts means several calls and readbacks, which may result in a frequency congestion (i.e. several stations that need to or try to transmit at the same time). This, in turn, easily leads to frequency blocking, need for repetition and further increase of the occupancy.. Overuse of progressive taxi instructions may lead to reduced efficiency of the traffic flow due to the increased controller workload, frequency occupancy and possibility for aircraft holding for further taxi instructions at an intermediate position.. A request for progressive taxi instructions may mean that the pilot is unsure about their position. Therefore, the use of a pilot’s report for confirming their location is not advisable..
