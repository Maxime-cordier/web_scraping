While the use of conditional clearances can help speed up the flow of traffic there are also some risks associated with misunderstanding that need to be taken into account: The flight crew might misinterpret the conditional clearance as a line-up or take-off clearance (e.g. due to mishearing or due to expectation bias);. The flight crew might misidentify one or more elements of the conditional clearance (e.g. if instructed to follow specific aircraft on final);. The controller might issue an ambiguous or unclear instruction or use non-standard phraseology..
