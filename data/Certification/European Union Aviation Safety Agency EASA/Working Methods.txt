The Agency applies transparent procedures for the adoption of opinions, acceptable means of compliance and guidance material. These procedures ensure the use of the relevant expertise, wide consultation of all interested parties and the right of each Member State to be associated with the adoption process. Special procedures allow the Agency to take immediate action in case of safety problems. Similar transparent procedures apply in the case of individual decisions. The Agency and the qualified entities acting on its behalf may undertake the inspections and investigations necessary in order to perform the tasks assigned to them. The Agency conducts inspections in the Member States to verify that safety regulations and the implementing rules are applied correctly at national level. EASA is authorised to conduct the investigations required in order to issue the relevant certificates and ensure continued safety oversight. The European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI) (ESSI), launched by EASA, was an aviation safety partnership in Europe. Its objective was to further enhance safety in Europe and for the European citizen worldwide in 2007-2017, through analysis of safety data, coordination with safety initiatives worldwide, and the implementation of cost effective action plans. ESSI closed in 2016 and its roles and functions were reallocated to the various teams and bodies involved in the European Safety Risk Management (SRM) system managed by EASA.
