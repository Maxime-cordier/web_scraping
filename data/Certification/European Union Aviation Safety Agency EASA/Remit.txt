The agency’s responsibilities are being acquired progressively. In 2008, through the implementation of a new EASA Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, EASA’s role was extended beyond its previous scope to cover Flight Operations and Flight Crew Licensing. In autumn 2009, as part of an aviation package also including the second package of measures for Single European Sky (SES II), the European Community adopted Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and extending EASA’s remit to encompass the field of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services. As previously, however, aircraft used for military, customs and police services, and persons and organisations involved in such activities, remain outside the remit of EASA.
