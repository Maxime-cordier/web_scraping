The FAA has a complex set of responsibilities in the ATM field. It provides the vast majority of tower-based ATM, including all major airport facilities. It is the sole provider of en-route ATM services in the US. The FAA’s service-provision tasks are undertaken by the Air Traffic Organisation (ATO), which has been established as a functionally separate entity within the FAA’s organisational structure. At the same time, the FAA is responsible for the safety regulation of all US aviation activities, including ATM. For this purpose, an ATM Safety Oversight organisation has been established within the regulatory division of the FAA with responsibility for oversight of the safety of the ATO’s operations and activities.
