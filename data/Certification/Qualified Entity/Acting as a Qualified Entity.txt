A Qualified Entity cannot issue certificates or legal approvals. Its role is to act on behalf of EASA providing support that will enable EASA to issue the required certificates or approvals. Use of QE’s is being approached on a limited basis. Decision 04-2009 of the EASA Management Board on “Guidelines for the Allocation of Certification Tasks to National Aviation Authorities and Qualified Entities” restricts the scope of allocation: Allocation of certification tasks to qualified entities, which are not national aviation authorities, requires further analysis and evaluation;, the scope of such allocation should in a first instance be limited to national aviation authorities. However, at the same time, it is being recognised that the implementation of certain regulatory systems may, in future, require a relaxation of this limitation. As an example, Notice of Proposed Amendment NPA 2008-07 expressed the intention to create a lighter regulatory regime based around a new process for the European Light Aircraft (ELA). Within the consultation process, it was acknowledged that to implement the regime as intended, a revision to the EASA Management Board Decision would be required, along with the definition of appropriate accreditation and oversight procedures.
