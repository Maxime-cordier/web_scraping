The Agency's Certification work is concentrated in its Certification Directorate and is organised on the basis of: Type certification and continuing airworthiness of products, parts and appliances,. Environmental approval of products,. Design organisations and, as appropriate, production organisations approval,. Foreign organisations approval.. The certification activities are carried out in accordance with procedures agreed by the EASA Management Board. While the above functions will ultimately be centralised into EASA, during its build-up phase the Agency relies on, and concludes contractual arrangements with, national aviation authorities who have historically filled this role. In the course of its certification work, EASA communicates with Type Certificate holders about ongoing developments in certification policy, typically on specific subjects. Where appropriate, letters, policy statements or guidance material are published to make clear the Agencyâ€™s views and position on the subjects in question. With regard to the extension of EASA remit to ATM/ANS and airports new organisational and communication arrangements will be put in place to enable the effective discharge of thse additional responsibilities.
