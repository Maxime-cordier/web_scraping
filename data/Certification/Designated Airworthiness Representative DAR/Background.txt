The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) allows the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to leverage its resources through delegation. The law says that FAA may delegate to a qualified individual a matter relating or issuing certificates, or related to the examination, testing, and inspection necessary to issue a certificate on behalf of the FAA administrator. An individual or an organization designated to act as a representative of the FAA administrator is known as a designee. Individual designees often are company employees who are authorized to act on behalf of the FAA only for their company. Other designees are independents who may work for any client.
