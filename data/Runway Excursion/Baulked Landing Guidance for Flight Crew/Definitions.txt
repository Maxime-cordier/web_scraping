Transport Canada defines the terms rejected landing and baulked landing as follows: Rejected Landing: A discontinued landing attempt. A rejected landing typically is initiated at low altitude but prior to touchdown and typically is initiated below DA(H) or MDA(H) of an IAP. A rejected landing may be initiated in either visual meteorological conditions (VMC) or instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). A rejected landing typically results in a missed approach. If related to the consideration of aircraft configuration(s) or performance, it is sometimes referred to as a Baulked Landing.. Baulked Landing: A discontinued landing attempt. The term is often used in conjunction with aircraft configuration or performance assessment, as in Baulked landing climb gradient. Also see Rejected Landing.. Whilst the two definitions are very similar and the obstacle clearance considerations for both are virtually identical, it is the initial climb performance aspect of the baulked landing definition that is the focus of this article.
