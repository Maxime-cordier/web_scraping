A stabilised approach is a fundamental factor in reducing the occurrence of both hard landings and runway excursions. Responsibility for achieving stabilised parameters rests with the flight crew and it is solely their decision to execute a missed approach should those parameters not be achieved. Air traffic control clearances and instructions, especially in non standard or adverse conditions can make achievement of the stabilisation criteria difficult or even impossible thus leading to a controller induced go around. To reduce the likelihood of such events, flight crew must evaluate an ATC clearance in the context of prevailing conditions, crew experience, and aircraft capability, and be prepared to refuse the instructions if an unstabilised approach is the most likely outcome.
