An AFM or Operations Manual always contains maximum wind speeds for take off and landing. These are stated as wind components and cover the crosswind, tailwind and head wind cases. Instant or two minute winds given by ATC must be converted into the applicable wind components by the flight crew and checked against the stated limitations. A suitable graphical display can be used by PM to read the received ATC figures onto if no automated conversion is available. In all cases, the apparent ‘general situation’ including any stated or apparent trend, is the key to using this information. Flight crew need to remember that ATC wind velocity information provided during take off or landing at times of high wind speed has to be intelligently interpreted rather than rigidly applied. It is also important to note that maximum wind components in the AFM are invariably dependent on the dry runway case, with more restrictive figures usually given for wet runways or those with reduced braking action.
