It is probably true to say that the importance of taking appropriate account of wind velocity during the take off and landing of an aircraft is appreciated by all aviators and all air traffic controllers. However, problems arise because unless it is completely calm, it is impossible when near the ground to know the actual wind velocity where an aircraft is at the precise time it is there. Using wind velocity information is therefore a matter of: Understanding exactly what velocity is being provided. Using the information appropriately.
