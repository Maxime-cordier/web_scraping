Unless the wind is completely calm, wind velocity rarely remains the same for very long; the extent of the variation in speed and direction is usually directly proportional to the mean wind speed because the effect of terrain friction upon the characteristics of the wind blowing across it increases as wind speed increases. Clearly, this effect will be greatest at airports situated in areas of uneven terrain or with significant obstacles affecting the degree of low level mechanical turbulence over particular parts of the aerodrome when particular general wind directions prevail. ICAO Annex 3 specifies the requirements for the reporting of gusting wind speeds and for reporting variation in wind direction; these are also reflected in the procedures for METAR observations. However, the variation in wind speed and direction are monitored and used independently; from a practical perspective, interpreting the potential extreme wind velocities is therefore likely to be difficult. However, in respect of wind speed, it is generally accepted that although the gust ratio - the ratio of the maximum gust to the mean wind speed - may frequently reach 2, only rarely will it exceed 3 even in very strong wind conditions.
