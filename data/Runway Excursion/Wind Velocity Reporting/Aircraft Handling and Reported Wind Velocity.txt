The wind velocity given to an aircraft is the best approximation of the actual wind velocity where the aircraft is at that time. The degree to which it is an approximation is always greater at higher general wind speeds but may also be dependent upon aerodrome-specific factors. Well recognised and significant local effects should be detailed in the AGA section of the State AIP. Intelligent use of available wind velocity information can be crucial to the avoidance of a Runway Excursion caused by loss of control near to or on the ground. Points to consider include the following: The 'instant' wind velocity provided by ATC should be from the data display for the most appropriate sensor for aircraft position - a pilot may not necessarily know where that is.. The ‘instant wind’ may be exactly that or may be a mean figure automatically generated over a few seconds.. The display from which an 'instant wind' is taken may be a digital display with or without an independent display of the short term average, range and trend in wind speed and direction or it may be a pair of simple mechanical dial displays.. All ‘instant winds’ are best interpreted in the context of the amount of short term fluctuation they appear to indicate.. Any wind direction given by ATC to aircraft about to land or take off should be expressed in degrees magnetic so as to correspond to the similar designation of runway alignment.. The significance of rapidly changing instantaneous wind velocity for aircraft handling in the absence of any definite trend is affected by the weight of the aircraft and its consequent inertia in respect of flight control inputs. The delayed response to thrust lever movement on large fan jet engines is also very significant..
