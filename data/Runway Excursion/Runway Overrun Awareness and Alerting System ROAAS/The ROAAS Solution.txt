Gulfstream and Honeywell have jointly developed ROAAS with the intended functions to provide an aid to: flight crew awareness of aircraft stopping-points relative to the approaching runway, based on real-time aircraft energy state; and. flight crew decision making for go-around and for timely use of all available stopping devices during a pending runway overrun situation. ROAAS uses the selected runway conditions from the FMS to perform calculations and it requires no additional flight crew inputs.. The underlying assumption is to minimise the impact on the flight deck, from the standpoint of crew workload and training, while aiding crew awareness of an impending runway overrun and supporting crew decision making. The result is an intuitive, graphical display that provides real-time indications of contextualised, energy-based aircraft stopping-points, accompanied by timely alerts if a pilot response is required. Systems that provide flight crew alerting of an impending runway overrun have previously been developed on other aeroplanes.
