The contributory factors on the flight deck which are mostly responsible for runway overruns upon landing are related to the lack of awareness that: the current aircraft energy state (i.e., height above glide slope and ground speed) may lead to an overrun;. the current autobrake setting may lead to an overrun;. the aircraft braking capabilities on the actual runway conditions are different from the planned and may lead to an overrun;. the aircraft is approaching the wrong (shorter) runway or that the approaching runway is shorter than planned and an overrun is pending;. An additional contributory factor to runway overruns has to do with the wrong or late decisions to adjust the aircraft energy state and/or configuration, and/or wrong or late decision to conduct a go-around or apply maximum deceleration.
