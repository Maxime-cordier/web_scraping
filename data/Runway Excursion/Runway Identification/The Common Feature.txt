Almost all occurrences where the correct runway was not positively identified have been because of complacency in visual acquisition. Such a failure most frequently occurs when a paved surface near to the correct with the same or a similar orientation is selected. However, an exception is the fatal accident which resulted from the use of an incorrect runway for take off in 2006, see CRJ1, Lexington KY USA, 2006. In most departure cases and almost all landing cases, visual reference is not restricted and there is simply a complete absence of any attempt at positive runway identification. Most documented occurrences have involved multi-crew aircraft, which indicates an additional failure of the effectiveness of cross monitoring by the pilot designated as PM. Incidents involving operations in restricted forward visibility occasionally feature in the take off case, but it appears that the more rigorous procedures and heightened flight crew awareness of the scope for inadvertent error which apply in these circumstanced are generally an effective mitigation against increased risk.
