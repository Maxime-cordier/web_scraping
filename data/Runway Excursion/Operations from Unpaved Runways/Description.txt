Unpaved runway surfaces can be subject to significant variations in their strength and surface characteristics because of climatic effects and the effects of aircraft operations, according to guidance to aircraft operators and aerodromes from Transport Canada in December 2017. Unpaved runways can achieve their design strength and surface characteristics when maintained properly and not subject to excessive moisture. Gravel surfaces deteriorate with time and under repeated traffic loadings. The most common defects occurring with gravel surfaces are ruts, frost heaves, depressions, potholes, soft spots and loss of aggregates. Periodic grading, compaction and addition of new material are required to maintain the integrity of the gravel surface and to ensure the safe operation of aircraft. Unpaved runway surfaces are typically non-homogeneous in composition and may contain various types of soils. Soil classification is used to predict the probable behaviour of soils under the influence of frost and moisture. The California bearing ratio (CBR) provides a measure of the ability of an unpaved surface to resist shearing under aircraft loads. CBR is the ratio of the load bearing capability of a given sample of soil compared to that of crushed limestone. The CBR of a given soil test is expressed as a percentage ranging from 0% to 100% or a whole number ranging from 0 to 100. CBR should be considered an index of runway surface strength as opposed to an absolute or true value of shear strength, because of the dependence of the CBR value on the measuring device used.
