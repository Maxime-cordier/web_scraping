The EUROCONTROL “Study of Runway Excursions from a European Perspective” showed that the causal and contributory factors leading to a runway excursion were the same in Europe as in other regions of the world. The study findings made extensive use of lessons from more than a thousand accident and incident reports. Those lessons have been used to craft the recommendations contained in the European Action Plan for the Prevention of Runway Excursions, Edition 1.0 of which was published in January 2013. The European Action Plan for the Prevention of Runway Excursions (EAPPRE) contains practical recommendations with guidance materials to assist operational staff with their implementation. According to ICAO, runway excursions are a persistent problem and their numbers have not decreased in more than 20 years. The European Working Group for Runway Safety who developed the EAPPRE considered all practicable means available ranging from the design of aircraft, airspace, procedures and technologies to relevant training for operational staff associated with runway excursion prevention. The recommendations and guidance materials contained in the Action Plan are intended for implementation by the relevant stakeholder organisations with the aim of reducing the rate of runway excursions and the runway excursion risk incumbent upon them. This European Action Plan, directed to all providers and users of European aerodromes and all European aircraft operators, is the result of the combined and sustained efforts of organisations involved in all areas of runway operations and has been co-developed with European Commercial Aviation Safety Team. The EAPPRE is a deliverable of the European Aviation Safety Plan, Edition 2011-2014. Download the document in full
