entry errors. It is vital that the training accurately reflects the operational reality and helps pilots to understand the threats they face at work. Training must focus on producing consistent and standardized pilot behaviors across the fleet. There are some functions which machines perform rather better than humans, including monitoring and cross-checking. Aircraft systems, including the FMS, are being designed to incorporate internal safeguards and checks to ensure that potentially erroneous values are highlighted to the pilots immediately, requiring them to be checked before proceeding. The FMS should also be able to highlight to the pilots if its own navigation database is out of date rather than expecting them to check it before each flight. These eminently reliable technological solutions are probably the best final line of defence against hazardous FMS data entry errors. Other possible technological enhancements include the use of a greater variety of colors and fonts on the CDU screens, and the use of QWERTY layout data entry keyboards. Perhaps most effective of all in managing errors would be the reconfiguration of all of the controls and indications for the integrated FMS to ensure that the operating philosophies are consistent and intuitive, and the relevant displays are located adjacent to the controls. FMS navigation databases contain numerous duplicate names for navigation aids and for waypoints, which offer significant potential for error. Whilst the solution to this is not solely technological it would remove a potential error source from within the FMS itself.
