In 2007, following the investigation of two serious incidents involving tail strikes that had occurred at Paris, Charles de Gaulle Airport (LFPG), a study entitled "USE OF ERRONEOUS PARAMETERS AT TAKEOFF" was conducted by the Applied Anthropology Laboratory (LAA) at the request of Le Bureau d'EnquÃªtes et d'Analyses (BEA) and the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC). Various investigation bodies, airlines and manufacturers were consulted in the course of the study as several other accidents, serious incidents, and incidents of the same type, had occurred in various parts of the world. These events generally involved new generation aircraft and had causal factors which included undetected flight crew errors, of varying degrees of significance, when they entered take-off parameters. Serious incidents and incidents arising from data-entry errors of the same type continued to occur after the study. In 2016, EASA promulgated Safety Information Bulletin 2016-02 'Use of Erroneous Parameters at Take-off. This bulletin was revised in September 2021 as SIB 2016-02R1. The complete text of the DGCA study and the EASA SIB 2016-02R1 are accessible from the Further Reading section below. Studies have also been undertaken by numerous other agencies.
