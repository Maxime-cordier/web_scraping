V1, especially when the two values are similar. the possible decision to reject a takeoff based on an erroneous V1 no longer guarantees safety margins. Inconsistent Crew Reaction in several cases, crews perceived abnormal airplane behaviour during takeoff. Some took off “normally”, with no counter strategy applied. Others were able to adopt different strategies such as rejecting the takeoff, increasing thrust or delaying rotation. in several cases, crews perceived abnormal airplane behaviour during takeoff.

FDM Under-Utilisation Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) offers the ability to track and evaluate flight operations trends and identify risk precursors, but is not necessarily being used to full potential to identify situations where erroneous take-off parameters may have been used. FDM can be used to systematically detect indications of insufficient take-off performance by implementing a few additional specific FDM event algorithms.
