The errors related to wrong angle of approach based on visual cues occur more often during the hours of darkness. Contributory factors are specifics of the terrain, airport environment (e.g. absence of lights creating 'black hole effect') and weather conditions. Some common scenarios include: Perception that the aircraft is too high - The pilot of an aircraft approaching a very long runway gains the impression that the aircraft is high on the approach and descends dangerously close to the ground;. Runway slope and mis-perception of the aircraft position based on visual reference The pilot of an aircraft approaching a runway with a pronounced up-slope gains the impression that the aircraft is high on the approach and descends dangerously close to the ground;. Mis-identification of the runway: The pilot sees a row of street lights and mistakenly lines up on them instead of the runway (see also Wrong Runway Use);.
