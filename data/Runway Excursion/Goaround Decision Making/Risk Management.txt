Since current accident rates are so low (e.g. 1:2,000,000), the vast majority of these 97% unstabilised approaches self-evidently land without incident. However, perhaps not always considered by the pilots making these decisions to land (or not to go-around) is the substantial increase in risk when flying an unstabilised aircraft down the final approach. This raises many questions, including: Why are pilots deciding to ignore their stabilised approach procedures?. What do pilots typically consider when making decisions to continue an unstabilised approach?. How can compliance with stabilised approach procedures be increased?. These questions should be considered by aircraft operators against the picture painted by their own operational performance data, from both Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) (OFDM) Programmes and pilot self-reporting. Using this data, and the presentations from the Go-Around Safety Forum flight operations departments are encouraged to open discussions on this topic, including: are our stabilised approach procedures properly predicated on approach and landing risk management?. if and when this is so, can demonstration of it to pilots be used to improve compliance?. if compliance is going to lead to more go arounds, are we sure that they will be flown at least as competently as any other 'normal' flight phase?.
