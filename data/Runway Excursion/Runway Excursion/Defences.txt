Never making the decision to reject a take off after V1 unless it is impossible to rotate or it is certain that the safety of the aircraft would be endangered if it became airborne.. Correct calculation of maximum operating weight, field length required and relevant critical speeds etc. based on accurately reported ambient conditions and subsequent correct input into aircraft flight systems should preclude a runway excursion under all normal and most abnormal conditions (e.g. power unit failure).. In the case of a minor runway excursion, International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) regulations specifying minimum cleared areas adjacent to and at either end of runways should ensure that damage to an aircraft leaving the paved surface of a runway is not severe.. Flying a Stabilised Approach which then leads to the landing runway threshold being crossed at the target speed and height.
