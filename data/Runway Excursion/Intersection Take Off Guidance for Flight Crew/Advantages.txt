There are some advantages to an intersection take off but they are relatively few. Primarily, an intersection take off has the potential to reduce taxy time by reducing the total taxy distance and potentially eliminate delays waiting for clearance to cross active runways. This, in turn, will reduce the amount of fuel burned during the taxy, reduce the noise signature of the aircraft whilst on the ground and reduce engine emissions during the ground period. An intersection departure might also provide a tactical advantage to the aircraft, especially when suggested by ATC. Depending upon the destination speed, route and altitude of the aircraft, an intersection take off can potentially allow ATC to change the aircraft departure sequence to help make maximum use of runway capacity. Note that this advantage may hinge upon the aircraft being fully ready for departure upon reaching the runway holding point for the intersection in question.
