An intersection take off is a departure initiated from an intersection line-up position other than the runway threshold without using the entire runway length. This results in an actual Take Off Distance Available (TODA) that is less than that published for the runway in use. An intersection take off may present certain operational advantages, but without appropriate due diligence and careful planning, an intersection take off has the potential to erode, or even negate, safety criteria, obstacle clearance capability and noise abatement requirements. An intersection take off may be requested by the pilot or offered by air traffic control (ATC). In all cases, the ultimate decision to request, accept, or decline, an intersection take off rests with the pilot. As there are many potential pitfalls associated with an intersection takeoff, it is not something that should be undertaken unless appropriate performance planning and pre-consideration of other factors has been carried out.
