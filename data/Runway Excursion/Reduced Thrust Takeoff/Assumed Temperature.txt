As stated above, at outside air temperatures above the flat rated temperature, there is a specific thrust value (variable by pressure altitude) for each temperature. If the thrust requirement for the takeoff is known, the associated temperature at which this thrust would be produced can be extracted from the applicable charts. This "assumed" temperature is then entered into the FMS. Note that regulations limit the amount by which normal takeoff thrust can be reduced to a maximum of 25%. For assumed temperature thrust reduction, the full thrust values of Vmcg and Vmca must be considered limiting as the full rated thrust for the actual OAT can be commanded by moving the thrust levers appropriately.
