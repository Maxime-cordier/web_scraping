The principal limitations of a jet engine are the maximum internal presure that the casing can withstand and the maximum allowable operating temperature. At low altitudes and cooler outside air temperatures (OAT), engine pressure is the limiting factor as the engine is capable of producing more pressure and, consequently, more thrust than the engine can contain. The FADEC will be programmed to flat rate the engine at a thrust corresponding to a safe internal engine pressure. This thrust value is the rated or maximum thrust that the engine will produce. Engines are flat rated by the manufacturer by referencing a specific environmental limit or flat rated temperature that is expressed as an ISA+xx° value. At an OAT of ISA+xx° or below, the engine is capable of producing its rated thrust. The FADEC compensates for varying OAT and presure altitude by adjusting fuel flow and limiting the rotational speed of the engine. As the OAT increases above the flat rated temperature, the engine is no longer capable of exceeding its limiting pressure, can no longer produce its rated thrust and therefore becomes temperature limited. At this point, the FADEC limits the internal temperature of the engine so the maximum temperature limit is not exceeded. As the OAT increases from flat rated temperature to the maximum allowed for engine operation, there is a linear reduction in the amount of thrust that the engine produces. If the amount of thrust that the engine can generate under given environmental conditions exceeds that required for takeoff, the FADEC can be "instructed" to reduce the amount of thrust to be produced by the engine.
