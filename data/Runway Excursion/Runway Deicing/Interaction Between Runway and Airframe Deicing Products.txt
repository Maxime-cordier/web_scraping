When runway de-cing products (mainly but not only Potassium Acetate or Potasssium Formate) alone or mixed with water or semi frozen deposits splash onto control surfaces during taxi or take-off run, they may affect the performance of an applied aircraft de-icing product. The effects may include a reduction in Holdover Time (HOT) or, in thickened fluids (Type II and IV), may accelerate the precipitation and build up of thickener residues encouraging greater moisture update on the rehydration of those residues, which may cause handling problems in flight. A separate challenge associated with the use of runway de icing chemicals is that melting snow and ice results in wet and mixed contamination so that friction may be reduced until the frozen contaminant is fully melted. It is also possible for the water from melted snow and ice to dilute the liquid de-icing agent and enable it to freeze and form invisible ice (’black ice’).
