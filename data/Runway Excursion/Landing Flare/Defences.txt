Defenses against the identified threats are fairly simple and are relatively few in number. They include but are not limited to: Stabilised approach - a stabilized approach ensures that the airspeed is appropriate, the rate of descent is acceptable and that the flight path would terminate within the touchdown zone. If the approach is not stable, a missed approach should be executed.. Flare height - flare initiation should be at the height recommended in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). Adjustments for crosswind or wind gust conditions may be required.. Pitch rate - the change from approach attitude to landing attitude should be accomplished at a rate which prevents ballooning but ensures landing attitude is achieved prior to touchdown. Excessive pitch should be avoided.. Power/thrust reduction - should comply with the recommended values in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). Adjustments for crosswind or wind gust conditions may be required.. Hold off and touchdown techniques - should be appropriate for the aircraft type and should avoid excessive float.. Roll out and deceleration procedures - should be initiated immediately following mainwheel touchdown.. Appropriate intervention by the Pilot Monitoring (PM) which may include assistive call-outs, commanding a go-around or taking over control (to ensure a go-around is initiated and safely flown only; taking over control to complete the landing must be avoided!).
