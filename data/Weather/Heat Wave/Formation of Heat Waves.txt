Heat waves can form in many ways. They often form when high pressure aloft (from 10,000–25,000 feet (3,000–7,600 meters) strengthens and remains over a region for several days up to several weeks. This is common in summer (in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres) as the jet stream 'follows the sun'. On the equator side of the jet stream, in the middle layers of the atmosphere, is the high pressure area. Summertime weather patterns are generally slower to change than in winter. As a result, this mid-level high pressure also moves slowly. Under high pressure, the air subsides (sinks) toward the surface. This sinking air acts as a dome capping the atmosphere. This cap helps to trap heat instead of allowing it to lift. Without the lift there is little or no convection and therefore little or no convective clouds (cumulus clouds) with minimal chances for rain. The end result is a continual build-up of heat at the surface that we experience as a heat wave. The heat wave can negatively impact the safety of aviation operations. To mention some of the most significant issues associated with heat waves: Aircraft performance decreases at high temperatures.. High temperatures can damage the airport ground surfaces.. Extreme heat stresses the vehicle cooling systems which could have negative impact on ground operations, etc.. Aircraft MLG wedged in tarmac due to extreme heat.
