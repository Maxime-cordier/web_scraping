Fog comprised of supercooled water droplets which normally deposit rime ice on contact with an object with a surface temperature of less than 0°C. Fog is generally defined in terms of visibility being less than 1000m horizontally and freezing fog typically forms in the temperature range of -0°C to -20°C. Freezing fog is reported as FZFG on a Meteorological Terminal Air Report (METAR) report.
