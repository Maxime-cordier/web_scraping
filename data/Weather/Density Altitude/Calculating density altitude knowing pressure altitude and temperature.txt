Since density altitude is pressure altitude corrected for temperature, the temperature deviation from the ISA value at that pressure altitude needs to be corrected, with lower temperatures than standard lowering the density altitude and higher temperatures raising the density altitude. The correction factor of 120 ft °C-1 will be used. DA = PA + CF (Ta – Tstd) where DA = density altitude (ft), PA = pressure altitude (ft), CF = correction factor (120 ft oC-1), Ta = actual temperature (°C), and Tstd = standard temperature (°C)
