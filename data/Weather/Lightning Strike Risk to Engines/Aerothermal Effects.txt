In the event of a lightning strike, lightning effects can sweep longitudinally down both sides of a narrow fuselage and affect the intake flows of both engines of a narrow-bodied aircraft, where the engines are necessarily mounted close to the fuselage sides (typical of many combat aircraft and all aft-engined business jet and airliner types). A risk therefore exists of a single lightning strike causing both engines to flame-out as a result of Aero-thermal effects.
