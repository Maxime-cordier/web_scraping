The lower Bergaglia Valley, which connects to the Lake of Como area and hence to the greater Po Valley region, receives insolation, and a moist anabatic valley wind to the Maloja Pass develops. The wider Engadine Valley, as stated, receives significant insolation, and correspondingly on certain days a thermal low is created. This rising air from the Engadine Valley floor, combined with the height difference between Bergaglia and Engadine valleys, results in relative high pressure in the Bergaglia valley and low pressure in the Engadine, and corresponding pressure gradient (see Fig. 3) . The Bergaglia Valley anabatic wind is also accelerated by the narrowing valley towards the Maloja Pass (Venturi Effect). The air eventually rises over the Maloja Pass and into the Engadine Valley (see Fig. 4). The resulting wind does reach velocities of 20 to 30 knots, depending on atmospheric conditions at the time of development. When the predominant flow in the region is westerly or south westerly, the velocities become more pronounced. There is also an anabatic Engadine valley wind, called the Bruescha, which forms in a similar way to the Bergaglia anabatic valley wind, but propagates in the opposite direction. However, due to the shallow slope of the Engadine valley, the Bruescha is much weaker than the Maloja Wind.
