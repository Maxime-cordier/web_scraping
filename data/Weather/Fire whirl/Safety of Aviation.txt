Pilots should be aware of the dangers associated with wildfires. While most commercial flights are only likely to come close to a wildfire on approach to landing, pilots should be aware of the possibility of turbulence and loss of lift when overflying an area of wildfires. On approach, in close proximity to a wildfire, flight crews are likely to experience strong wind shear and reduced visibility. Crews should also keep a lookout for aircraft engaged in fire fighting operations that may be operating in close proximity to controlled airspace and approach lanes.
