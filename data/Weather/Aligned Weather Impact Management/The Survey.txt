In 2012, on stakeholder request, a dedicated severe weather risk management survey was carried out. The survey scope covered the entire chain of severe weather impact and risk management starting with weather forecasting by meteorological offices, addressing pre-tactical management by FMPs and the Network Manager and concluding with the deployment of tactical measures by ATC and pilots. The information collected and analysed in the course of the survey revealed a number of potential areas for improvement of the meteorological products used in severe weather impact assessment and enabled the identification of important issues which need to be addressed in order to improve the management of severe weather impact on flight operations and ATM in Europe, notably: With a few exceptions, operational staff, responsible for severe weather risk management at ATC units, use standard weather forecasts and reports, weather radar data and some other meteorological products. Use of dedicated tools and models for assessment of severe weather impact on ATC and flight operations is rather an exception. ATM decision support systems making use of enhanced weather forecast products and ATC impact assessment algorithms are not yet in operational use.. Meteorological products (forecasts and current weather reports) conform to standards (ICAO Annex 3). However, there are very few enhanced products, providing improved accuracy of weather forecasts, appropriate to support efficient pre-tactical severe weather impact assessment and decision making.. Optimisation of ATM system performance at network level as opposed to optimisation at ‘local” level (optimal operation of network components does not mean optimal operation of the network) would require review of the current set of performance indicators and implementation of incentives for ANSPs..
