Mist and Fog are the terms used to describe low visibility caused by water droplets suspended in the air. Mist is a term used to describe visibility of greater than 1 km while Fog is the term used when visibility is less than 1 km. Fog is effectively surface cloud and has a significant impact on the conduct of flying operations, particularly landing and take-off. There are many different types of fog defined according to how they are formed.
