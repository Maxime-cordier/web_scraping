Aerodrome Met observations have been cited as a causal factor in aircraft accidents, CAP 746 provides the following example. PRM1, vicinity Samedan Switzerland, 2010 — On 19 December 2010, a Raytheon 390 inbound to Samedan from Zagreb made a daylight approach to Runway 21 at destination in marginal VMC which involved a steep and unstable descent from which a landing was not possible. The subsequent go around was followed by entry to a visual right hand circuit which was contrary to local procedures due to terrain constraints. Overbanking in the turn towards final approach was followed by a stall and loss of control which led to ground impact which, with the post crash fire, destroyed the aeroplane and fatally injured both occupants.. Accident investigators examined weather information provided by the aerodrome in relation to decisions by the pilots to commence or continue visual approaches to Samedan. They found that the relevant Met observations were an unreliable guide to conditions likely to be encountered by the accident pilots, and that reports from pilots of other aircraft approaching the airport were not consistently relayed to the accident pilots. “[Flight information service officers] were unable to append trend information to their METARs and since it was, as a result, only possible to terminate a METAR with ‘NOSIG’ [no significant changes are forecast], there was the potential for crews to be misled,” the publication said. Other findings were that automatic terminal information service broadcasts did not match the current METAR, and special reports were not transmitted to the pilots. Also, the final report of the accident investigation stated that “weather minimums at the time of the accident involved a considerable risk” and that “the visibility and cloud bases determined on Samedan airport were not representative for an approach from [the northeast] because they did not correspond to the actual conditions in the [Runway 21] approach sector.”
