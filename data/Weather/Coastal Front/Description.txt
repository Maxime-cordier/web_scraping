Coastal fronts are shallow (less than 1 km deep) boundaries that separate colder, continental air masses from much warmer and moisture laden maritime air masses. Temperature differences across the front can be as much as 30-50oF (17–28oC). Typically, coastal fronts develop in coastal waters or within 100–200 km of the coast during the cooler half of the year when the land is cold relative to the ocean. In the United States, coastal fronts are most frequent in New England, the Middle Atlantic states, the Carolinas, and Texas.
