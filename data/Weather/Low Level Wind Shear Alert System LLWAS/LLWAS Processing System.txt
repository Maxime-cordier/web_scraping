The aim of the system is to provide visual and audio alerts to ATC so that they can pass on information and warnings about wind shear and microbursts to pilots and other aerodrome services and customers. The system processor continually monitors and compares the vector difference between the perimeter and centre-field surface wind observations. The perimeter sensors (anemometers) are sampled regularly by the central control unit e.g. every ten seconds. The centre-field sensor produces a two-minute running mean surface wind which is displayed in the ATC tower along with any detected gusts. If the vector difference between the centre-field and a perimeter sensor is more than 15 knots, the relevant perimeter wind is also displayed and an audio-visual alarm is triggered. Microburst conditions are detected by different algorithms, as a microburst can easily occur between two perimeter sensors without affecting either of them. In the latest up-to-date LLWAS, variations in wind speed and direction are compared between sensors along a runway approach corridor; these variations can provide timely and accurate notice of a microburst.
