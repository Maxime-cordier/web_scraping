In the 1920s, meteorologists of the famed Scandinavian School developed the theory of the Polar Front, a semi-permanent, semi-continuous undulating front encircling the globe and separating polar and tropical air masses. As areas of low pressure form along this front in the northern hemisphere, air flows towards the low. Because of the rotation of the Earth, the winds will flow in an anti-clockwise direction around and into the low. Warm air from the south rushes northward ahead of the low, and cool air from the north is pulled southward behind the low. The boundary between the two air masses is a front. A warm front is formed to the east of the low while a cold front forms initially to the west and then southward.
