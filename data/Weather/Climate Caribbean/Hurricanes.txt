Tropical Revolving Storms have considerable impact on aviation, causing considerable damage to infrastructure and aircraft caught on the ground and a significant hazard to aircraft in flight. The Hurricane season lasts from June to November and affects most Caribbean islands north of Grenada. Barbados and Trinidad, in the south-east, seldom experience hurricanes. The frequency and severity of storms varies from year to year and may be influenced by other climatic factors such as El Niño/La Niña. The following map shows the Köppen climate classification for the Caribbean and neighbouring territory.
