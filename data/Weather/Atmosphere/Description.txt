The atmosphere is the space around the Earth which is filled by a mixture of gasses held against the Earth by the force of gravity. This mixture of gasses we call air. Because the Earth spins on its axis, and because the surface temperature is greater at the equator than at the poles, the atmosphere extends further out into space at the equator than at the poles. Air Density decreases with increasing altitude. The atmosphere is divided vertically into four regions: the Troposphere, the Stratosphere, the Mesosphere, and the Thermosphere.
