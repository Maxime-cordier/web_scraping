The boundary between two air masses is often distorted by warmer air bulging into the colder air, with the bulge moving along like a wave. The leading edge of the wave is known as a "warm front" while the trailing edge is called a "cold front". The cold front usually moves across the surface faster than the warm front. The pressure near the top of the wave falls sharply and a depression forms.
