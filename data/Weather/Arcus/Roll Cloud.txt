A roll cloud (Cloud Atlas name volutus) is a low, horizontal, tube-shaped, and relatively rare type of arcus cloud. They differ from shelf clouds by being completely detached from other cloud features. Roll clouds usually appear to be "rolling" about a horizontal axis. They are a solitary wave called a soliton, which is a wave that has a single crest and moves without changing speed or shape. They occur with strong inversion conditions with a shallow layer of colder air moving under warm air. The warm air is lifted up ahead of the leading edge of the cold air, and with enough moisture present, a cloud is formed. The air then rolls down behind the leading edge giving the roll appearance. They can last for several hours and be hundreds of miles long. One of the most famous frequent occurrences is the Morning Glory cloud in Queensland, Australia, which can occur up to four out of 10 days in October. One of the main causes of the Morning Glory cloud is the mesoscale circulation associated with sea breezes that develop over the Cape York Peninsula and the Gulf of Carpentaria. However, similar features can be created by downdrafts from thunderstorms or ahead of cold fronts and are not exclusively associated with coastal regions. Coastal roll clouds have been seen in many places, including California, the English Channel, Shetland Islands, the North Sea coast, coastal regions of Australia, and Nome, Alaska.
