Lake effect snow clouds normally form in narrow bands, referred to as "streamers". Streamer length and orientation are determined by the shape of the body of water and the prevailing wind direction and speed. In extreme cases, the heaviest bands of snowfall could be as much as 40 km wide and extend well over 100 km inland from the lake. Within the streamer, snowfall rates can exceed 15 cm per hour. If the wind remains steady, a band of snow can hover over one location for several hours resulting in a metre or more of snow. Lake effect snowfall is very localized and 20 km on either side of the streamer, the skies might be sunny with no snow at all.
