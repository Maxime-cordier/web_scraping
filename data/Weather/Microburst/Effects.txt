Downbursts are a particular hazard to aircraft at low level, especially on take-off or landing. An aircraft approaching a downburst will first encounter a strong headwind, which will lead to an increase in indicated airspeed. When trying to fly a set airspeed on approach, a pilot might therefore be tempted to reduce power. This would be very dangerous because, as the aircraft passes thorough the downburst, the wind becomes a tailwind and the indicated airspeed and lift drop. The significant downward force of air in the downburst may be enough to force the aircraft into the ground or at least cause it to lose a significant amount of height. The subsequent loss of performance, as the aircraft encounters tailwinds, may cause further loss of height and be enough to cause the aircraft to stall. Once caught in a downburst, escape is only possible by flying straight ahead; whichever way an aircraft turns, it will encounter the tail winds and the associated performance impact. If the aircraft is in a turn at that point then the stalling speed will be higher, possibly making the situation worse.
