Mediterranean tropical-like cyclones, often referred to as "medicanes" but sometimes also as Mediterranean cyclones or as Mediterranean hurricanes, are meteorological phenomena observed over the Mediterranean Sea. On rare occasions, some storms have reached the strength of a Category 1 hurricane. The main hazard posed by medicanes is not usually from destructive winds, but from life-threatening torrential rains and flash floods.
