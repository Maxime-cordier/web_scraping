The convergence of surface boundaries with horizontal shear and thunderstorm updraft forms the circulation. The circulation is then then pulled in an upward direction to the base of the thunderstorm. A typical tornado/funnel cloud always forms from top to down, but the landspout always forms bottom up. A landspout generally lasts for less than 15 minutes; however, they can persist substantially longer, and produce heavy damage. They progress through recognizable stages of formation, maturation and dissipation, and tend to decay when a downdraft or significant precipitation occur nearby. They may form in lines or groups of multiple landspouts.
