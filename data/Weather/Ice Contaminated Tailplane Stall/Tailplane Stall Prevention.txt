Note that in ALL cases, manufacturer's procedures and AFM guidance take precedence over any recommendations of this article If, in an aircraft type susceptible to tailplane stall, an approach in icing conditions cannot be avoided, the pilot should: Avoid use of autopilot when flying an approach in known icing conditions.. Plan to fly the approach and landing at the minimum allowable flap setting for the conditions.. Be ready to ‘undo’ any flap selection.. Avoid abrupt pitching manoeuvres and power changes. Nose down pitching motion and power changes in propeller aircraft can increase the tailplane AOA.. Fly the approach "on speed" for the configuration. Avoid extension of the flaps near the flap limit speeds.. If indications of an impending stall occur during or shortly after flap extension, immediately retract the flaps to the previous setting and increase the airspeed to the minimum manoeuvring speed for the reduced flap setting.. Make any nose down pitch changes gradually, even in turbulent conditions..
