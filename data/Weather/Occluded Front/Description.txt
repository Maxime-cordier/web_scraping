When large masses of warm air and cold air meet, they do not mix because of density differences. Instead, they form a front, usually hundreds of miles long. An Occluded Front forms when a warm air mass gets caught between two cold air masses. The warm air mass rises as the cool air masses push and meet in the middle. The temperature drops as the warm air mass is occluded, or “cut off,” from the ground and pushed upward. Such fronts can bring strong winds and heavy precipitation. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas. There are two types of occlusion, warm and cold: In a cold occlusion, the cold air mass overtaking the warm front is colder than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the cool air mass overtaking the warm front is warmer than the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. The occlusion process discussed above follows the original Norwegian Cyclone Model with the formation of an occluded front simply as a result of surface frontal movements. Recent findings indicate that the occlusion process is more complex than this, and that it is tied into the development of a low pressure area or cyclone and developments above the surface.
