Early in the 20th century, Norwegian meteorologists formulated a model for an extratropical cyclone that develops as a disturbance along the boundary (front) between the polar and mid-latitude air masses. The disturbance distorts the front into a wavelike configuration. Wave forms on front (image source: NOAA) As the pressure within the disturbance decreases, the disturbance assumes the appearance of a cyclone with its characteristic counter-clockwise flow. Southerly winds take warm air northward ahead of the storm and northerly winds bring cold air south behind it. Besides rotating counter-clockwise, the air also flows inward toward the center of the cyclone. As the cyclone intensifies, the cold air streams toward the equator faster than the warm air streams toward the pole, allowing the cold front to overtake the warm front thus forcing the warm air aloft. This produces a more complicated frontal structure called an occluded front, which separates two relatively cold air masses. The occlusion process may be followed by further storm intensification. The separation of the cyclone from the warm air toward the Equator, however, eventually leads to the storm's decay and dissipation. The Norwegian model still retains merit, as it is a good description for some cyclogenesis events.
