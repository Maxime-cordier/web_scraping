The elements of these messages are normally given in the order below. Some elements or groups may be omitted when they are not needed or do not apply: Code Name The indicator group e.g. METAR, SPECI, or TREND as appropriate. Where a number of METARs are issued in the same bulletin, this, along with a date time group may be in the bulletin header. Location The ICAO indicator of the reporting station eg. EGLL. Date/Time of Report The day of the month and the time of the observation in hours and minutes UTC e.g. 191350Z. AUTO The optional code word AUTO indicates that the report has been generated using data from an automated observing system. Surface Wind The mean wind direction in degrees true to the nearest 10 degrees, from which the wind is blowing and the mean wind speed in knots over the 10 minute period immediately preceding the observation e.g. 35015KT = 350 degrees true/15 kts; VRB05KT = variable/5 kts; 00000 = CALM. If gusts exceed the mean wind speed by 10kts or more in the 10 minutes preceding the time of the report, a letter G and 2 more figures are added to indicate the maximum wind speed e.g. 23018G30KT = 230 degrees true/18 kts gusting to a maximum of 30 kts. Reports may express wind speed in metres per second ('MPS) or Kilometres per hour (KPH). Winds greater than 100 kts or more shall be preceded by the letter P and reported as P99KT or P99MPS or P199KPH. Visibility Reported in a four figure group (e.g. 0400 = 400 metres; 8000 = 8 km) up to but excluding 10 km; 9999 = 10km or more; 0000 = less than 50 metres visibility. Runway Visual Range (RVR) Aerodromes may include a letter indicator R followed by the runway designator, a"/" and the touchdown zone RVR in metres, e.g. R06/0400. If the RVR is assessed on 2 or more runways simultaneously then the RVR group will be repeated.. Parallel runways will have L, C, or R added to the runway designator e.g. R24L/1100.. If the RVR is greater than the maximum value that can be measured, P will precede this value e.g. R24L/P1500.. If the RVR is less than the minimum value that can be measured , M will precede this value e.g. R24L/M0050.. If RVR trends can be measured then U, D, or N will follow the RVR value to indicate increasing, decreasing or no change respectively.. Weather Weather is indicated by up to 3 groups comprising symbols and letters from the following: e.g - FZDZ = Slight Freezing Drizzle; + SHRASN = Heavy Shower of Rain and Snow; REUP = Recent Unidentified Precipitation. Cloud Cloud amount is reported as FEW = few (1-2 oktas), SCT = scattered (3-4 oktas), BKN = broken (5-7 oktas) or OVC = overcast (8 oktas), followed by the height of the cloud base in hundreds of feet above aerodrome elevation e.g. SCT018 = scattered clouds at 1800 ft.
