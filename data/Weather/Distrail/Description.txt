There is some debate regarding the mechanism behind the formation of a distrail. An alternative explanation is that when an aircraft flies through a super cooled cloud, this cloud freezes due to the disturbing airflow created by the aircraft, as well as by the addition of plenty of freezing nuclei due to the aircraft's exhaust gases. Some of the particles act as the nuclei onto which the droplets can start freezing. As the ice crystals form, they grow in size and fall below, and this is sometimes observed as fall streak clouds below the actual distrait, or they evaporate instantaneously when entering the lower layers.
