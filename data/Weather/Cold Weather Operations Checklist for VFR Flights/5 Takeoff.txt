a) do not overboost supercharged or turbine engines. Use power charts for the pressure altitude and temperature to determine appropriate manifold pressure and engine pressure ratio. b) remember that on multiengine aircraft the critical engine-out minimum control speed (Vmc) will be higher than the published figure. c) with reciprocating engines use carburetor heat as required. On some occasions, in extremely cold weather, it may be advisable to use carburetor heat on takeoff. d) use anti-ice and deice equipment as outlined in Flight Manual. In turbine powered aircraft remember that use of bleed air will, in most cases, affect aircraft performance.
