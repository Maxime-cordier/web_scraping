a) in moderate cold an engine may be started without preheat. Use care as it may be difficult due oil being partially congealed. b) avoid the tendency to overprime. It may lead to cylinder walls scoring, poor compression and hard starting. It may also be a cause of engine fire. c) the reason for hard starting may be icing over sparkplug electrodes. To avoid it, heating is necessary and, if heat is not available then the plugs should be removed and heated to the point where no more moisture is present. d) remember that during prolonged idling of the engine it may stop as insufficient heat is produced to keep the plugs from fouling out. When engine stops after long idling check plugs for icing. e) remember that turbine engines can accumulate internal ice overnight and resist rotation when starting is attempted. Therefore with any indication of locked rotor, unusual noise or low RPM â€“ discontinue the start.
