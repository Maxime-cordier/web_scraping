a) during descent, there may be a problem keeping the engine warm enough. It may be desirable to use more power than normal, which may require extension of gear or/and flaps to keep the airspeed within limits. Use of carburetor heat may be necessary to prevent induction icing as well as to heat the carburetor to help vaporise the fuel. b) keep in mind that two conditions are commonly associated with clear en-route weather: blowing snow and ice fog. Check the forecast carefully as these conditions are hazardous and may require alternate actions.
