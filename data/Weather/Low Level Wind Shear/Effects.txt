The main effects of wind shear are: Turbulence. Violent air movement (up- or down-draughts or swirling or rotating air patterns). Sudden increase or reduction of airspeed. Sudden increase or decrease of groundspeed and/or drift.. Clear Air Turbulence (CAT) (CAT), which may be very severe, is often associated with jet streams. Rotor action or down-draughts in the lee of mountain waves can create difficult flying conditions and may even lead to loss of control.
