Set the required pitch attitude (as recommended in the AOM/QRH); Level the wings to maximize the climb gradient, unless a turn is required for obstacle clearance; Closely monitor the airspeed, airspeed trend and flight-path angle (as available); Allow airspeed to decrease to stick shaker onset (intermittent stick shaker activation) while monitoring the airspeed trend; Do not change the flaps or landing-gear configurations until out of the wind shear condition; and, When out of the wind shear condition, increase airspeed when a positive climb is confirmed, retract the landing gear, flaps and slats, then establish a normal climb profile.". Disconnect the A/THR, if available, and maintain or set the throttle levers to maximum takeoff thrust;. If the autopilot (AP) is engaged and if the FD provides wind shear recovery guidance, keep the AP engaged; or, Follow the FD pitch command, if the FD provides wind shear recovery guidance; or, Set the required pitch attitude (as recommended in the AOM/QRH);.
