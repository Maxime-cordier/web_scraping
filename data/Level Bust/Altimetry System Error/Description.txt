The introduction of reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) into Europe in 2002, by which the vertical separation between high level traffic was reduced from 2000 ft to 1000 ft, was partially enabled by the ability to measure true aircraft altitudes during normal operations. This was crucial to the program safety case as the risk of an accident is inherently greater in a 1000 ft separation environment. By deploying the first wide area height monitoring infrastructure in the world, EUROCONTROL established itself as a world leader in height monitoring activities and the evaluation of Altimetry System Error (ASE). ASE is the difference between the altitude where the pilot, the ground controller and the aircraftâ€™s own systems (including TCAS) believe the aircraft to be and the true altitude. The most important fact regarding ASE is that it is invisible to all except the Height Monitoring Units (HMU) that operate 24/7 monitoring some of the densest portions of airspace in Europe. Whilst the evidence from the HMU systems supports the assumption that operations in RVSM airspace are safe, other assumptions regarding ASE have had to be reconsidered. This has implications for air operators, maintenance organizations, airworthiness authorities, aircraft and avionics manufacturers and engineering organizations supplying aircraft modifications.
