Avoid issuing vertical re-clearances that, given the observed evidence of the rate of climb/descent (energy state) of the aircraft, cannot be achieved without exceeding the cleared level .. Observe strict radio discipline, especially standard phraseology speed and timeliness of communication and language;. Where appropriate, stress the need the need to revert to the relevant barometric sub scale setting in the message to pilots.. When assigning higher vertical speeds (more than 1500 ft/min) make sure that the restriction does not apply for the final 1000-2000 feet. Example instruciton: ABC123, DESCEND FL 250 AT 2000 FEET PER MINUTE UNTIL PASSING FL 300 (in this example, the conflicting aircraft is maintaining FL 310)..
