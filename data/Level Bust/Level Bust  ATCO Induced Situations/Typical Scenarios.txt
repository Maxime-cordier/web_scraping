Situations sometimes occur in which instructions given by the ATCO are difficult or even impossible to follow without a deviation occurring. The following are some typical scenarios: Scenario 1. The ATCO issues a clearance to climb or descend to a specified flight level and the pilot follows this clearance. Subsequently, the ATCO instructs the pilot to level at an intermediate flight level but at the time of this re-clearance the flight has passed the re-cleared flight level.. Scenario 2. The flight is cleared to climb from below the transition altitude to a flight level above it. The pilot sets standard pressure setting and commences the climb. The ATCO re-clears the flight to level at an altitude below the transition altitude. The pilot levels at the re-cleared level, but with the standard pressure setting still set.. Scenario 3. The flight is cleared to descend from above the transition level to an altitude that is below it. The pilot sets QNH and commences the descent. The ATCO re-clears the flight to a flight level above the transition level. The pilot levels at the re-cleared level but with QNH still set.. Scenario 4. The ATCO issues an instruction to descend (usually) or climb (less often) by e.g. 2000 or 3000 feet at a rate which is too high to be maintained during the entire movement (e.g. 2000 ft/min or more). This could be because the controller needs the aircraft to quickly pass through the level of another aircraft. The pilot would likely not be able to comply with both requirements (maintain high vertical speed and then level off at the cleared level without making a level bust). Therefore, likely outcomes of such an instruction are a level bust (if the pilot complies with the instruction but is unable to level off) or a loss of separation (if the pilot levels off but does not comply with the assigned vertical speed)..
