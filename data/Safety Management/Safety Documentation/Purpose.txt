The purpose of the SMS documentation is to document the safety management system (SMS) of the organisation and communicate it internally to staff and externally to the organisations concerned, for example to the regulator. It enables the correct execution of safety procedures and thus the achievement of the organisationâ€™s safety objectives. Safety records are maintained in order to provide documented safety assurance to all associated with, responsible for or dependent upon the services provided by the organisation, and to the regulator. Safety records are needed to demonstrate that the SMS is operated according to the expectations.
