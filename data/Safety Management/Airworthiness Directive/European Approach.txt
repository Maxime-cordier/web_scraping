In Europe, ADs are issued by the EASA acting in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 2018/1139 on behalf of the European Community, its Member States and of the European third countries that participate in the activities of EASA under Article 66 of that Regulation. The criteria for issuance of an AD are defined in 21A.3B and associated AMC material. For products, parts and appliances, for which the Agency only exercises the design responsibilities of the State of Registry, its policy is to endorse automatically the airworthiness directives issued by the State of Design, except if it itself issues a different airworthiness directive before the date that the AD of the State of design takes effect. EASA can adopt ADs from countries outside the coverage of the EASA Regulation arrangements. Any AD issued by the State of Design for an aircraft imported from a third country, or for an engine, propeller, part or appliance imported from a third country and installed on an aircraft registered in a EU Member State, shall apply unless EASA has issued a different decision before the date of entry into force of that AD.
