The aviation service provider organisations have a legal responsibility to report to their national authorities all accidents or serious incidents of which they become aware. The responsibilities for reporting, collection and exchange of safety data, and investigation of safety occurrences are established by ICAO Annex 13 and amplified in European Parliamentâ€™s Directives, EU-OPS/JARs, in ESARR 2 and in national regulations. Additionally, operational personnel are required to report certain categories of safety occurrences to their employers and to the national authority under a national mandatory occurrence reporting scheme and internal (to the organisation) reporting system.
