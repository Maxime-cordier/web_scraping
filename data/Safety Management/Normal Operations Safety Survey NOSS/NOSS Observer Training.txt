The observer training and data collection is an important element of the pre-data collection phase. The training will normally last up to 5 working days. Focus in the training programme is on the TEM framework, as the observational concept that will guide observers towards what they are expected to look for, and on how to fill in the observation forms. The last days of the training programme comprise “controlled” observations, in which the completed observation forms are analysed with the observers in order to help ensure the consistency and reliability of reports from different observers.
