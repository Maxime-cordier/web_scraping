In observing the business-like approach to safety underlying Safety Management Systems (SMS), it is evident that in order to sustain safety in the modern aviation system, a proactive data collection methodology, to complement the existing reactive systems, is required. To that end, electronic data acquisition systems and non-jeopardy self-reporting programmes were introduced to collect safety data from normal operations. The latest addition to these proactive safety data collection methodologies are data acquisition systems that are based on direct observation of operational personnel during normal operations. NOSS was introduced by recommendation 2/5 of the Eleventh International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Air Navigation Conference, held in Montreal in 2003, which reads: “That ICAO initiate studies on the development of guidance material for the monitoring of safety during normal air traffic service operations, taking into account, but not limited to, the line operations safety audit (LOSA) programmes which have been implemented by a number of airlines.” Although NOSS is different from LOSA in many respects, there are also similarities in the methodology applied by both. NOSS and LOSA are both based on the Threat and Error Management (TEM) framework. NOSS was developed with the assistance of the ICAO NOSS Study Group and is based on a similar method used in the flight deck environment.
