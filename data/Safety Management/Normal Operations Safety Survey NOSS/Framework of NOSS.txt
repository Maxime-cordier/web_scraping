NOSS is based on the Threat and Error Management (TEM) framework as developed by the University of Texas. TEM is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the interrelationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. The TEM framework focuses simultaneously on the operational context and the people discharging operational duties in such a context. The use of TEM thus provides a common framework that can assist in addressing multi-disciplinary issues in the aviation industry through the exchange and analysis of safety data from normal aviation operations.
