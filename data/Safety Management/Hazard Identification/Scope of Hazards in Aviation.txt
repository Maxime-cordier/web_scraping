The scope of hazards existing in aviation operation environment is very wide. That is why hazard identification is a complex process as it considers extensive range of possible sources of failure. Depending on the nature and size of the organisation, its operational scope and environment, there are different factors to consider during hazard identification. The following factors listed in ICAO Doc 9859 Safety Management Manual are examples of common hazard sources in aviation: Design factors, including equipment and task design;. Procedures and operating practices, including their documentation and checklists, and their validation under actual operating conditions;. Communications, including the medium, terminology and language;. Personnel factors, such as company policies for recruitment, training and remuneration;. Organisational factors, such as the compatibility of production and safety goals, the allocation of resources, operating pressures and the corporate safety culture;. Work environment factors, such as ambient noise and vibration, temperature, lighting and the availability of protective equipment and clothing;. Regulatory oversight factors, including the applicability and enforceability of regulations; the certification of equipment, personnel and procedures; and the adequacy of surveillance audits; and. Defences, including such factors as the provision of adequate detection and warning systems, the error tolerance of equipment and the extent to which the equipment is hardened against failures..
