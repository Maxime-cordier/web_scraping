In Europe, civil aviation authorities and safety investigation units have joined to develop the European Co-ordination Centre for Accident and Incident Reporting Systems (ECCAIRS), which describes its mission as aiding national and European transport entities in the collection, sharing and analysis of safety information. The systems are part of a continent-wide effort to improve safety in public transportation. ECCAIRS relies on a specially designed electronic reporting system, which allows all European Union member states to collect data in the same manner and to share the information. Beginning with a software suite that was first released in 1998, the system originally focused on collecting, sharing and analyzing safety information related to aviation; the system has been updated several times, including a 2011 enhancement that has also been used in gathering safety information from railways and maritime operations. Member state safety information is held in two central databases: the European Central Repositories for Occurrences (ECR-ECCAIRS) and the European Central Repository for Safety Recommendations (ECR-SRIS), both located in the European Commissionâ€™s Joint Research Centre.
