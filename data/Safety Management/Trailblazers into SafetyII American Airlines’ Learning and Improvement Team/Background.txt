Beginning in 2018, American Airlines (AA) has been striving to implement Safety-II in flight operations. With the support of senior leadership, the Learning and Improvement Team (LIT) was created and tasked with this responsibility. LIT members were initially recruited from the ranks of the AA line operations safety audit (LOSA) observer corps due to their experience in flight deck observation and data collection using a traditional LOSA framework.
