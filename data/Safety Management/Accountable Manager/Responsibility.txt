An Accountable Manager is likely to rely heavily upon a small number of senior managers with subordinate executive responsibility for each area of regulated technical specialism in their organisation. These people will report directly to the Accountable Manager and may themselves have to be designated and approved by the Regulatory Authority as specific Post Holders. In the case of an organisation which holds an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) or equivalent regulatory permission, then the responsibilities of Post Holders are likely to include Flight Operations, Flight Training, Ground Operations, Continuing Airworthiness and Quality Assurance. However, the Accountable Manager will also need to ensure that the person with responsibility for independent safety oversight across their whole organisation also reports to him/her.
