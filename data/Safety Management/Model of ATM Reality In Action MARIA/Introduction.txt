The Model of ATM Reality In Action (MARIA) is a knowledge database and an automation framework developed by NAV Portugal to provide a sound base for safety analysis by describing the whole ATM system and the interdependencies between its functions. It is coded as a graph providing additional possibilities of automatic analysis. The model has undergone extensive validation and is considered mature. Experimental work has been done on hazard and cause identification with success.
