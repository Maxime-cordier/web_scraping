Most investigations use witness statements to help reconstruct the events. The following practices generally give a better chance for obtaining the most (and most useful) information: statements need to be taken shortly after the event, otherwise memories may fade.. no statement should be discarded out of hand. A statement from a witness experienced in aviation is not necessarily the most valuable.. oral form is preferable to written. Most people do not like writing, and will generally tend to summarize instead of giving as much detail as possible.. recording the interview (with the person's consent) is preferable to taking notes. This is especially true if the number of witnesses is high, as the interviewer may tent to focus on "interesting" information from certain point on and omit the facts that are being repeated by the other witnesses.. single interview is preferrable to a group session. Firstly, in a group activity, one (or some) person could influence the others and secondly, some people prefer not to talk in public.. interruptions are likely to cause the witness to lose their train of thought and crucial information may be missed. The best option is to listen to the whole story and ask for clarification later.. it is important to make a person feel comfortable during the interview. This would make them more likely to contact the investigator again if they remember something they missed during the interview..
