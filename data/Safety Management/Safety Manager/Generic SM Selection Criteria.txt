Typically the SM should possess operational management expertise and understanding of the operations-critical tasks and systems within the organisation. The operational background, solely, is not sufficient for the successful SM. He/she must possess competency in regard of safety management principles. Some key skills must be taken into consideration to complement the professional expertise of the SM: Professional knowledge of the organisation’s specific operations and environment;. Analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities;. Inter and intra-organisation project management skills;. People-oriented skills such as, objectivity, fairness etc.;. Communication skills, both written and oral.. When those skills are matched with individual’s traits such as leadership and ability to set personal example of “how to do the correct thing”, an important step is made towards a building of positive safety culture.
