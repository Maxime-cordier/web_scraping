In its report to the ICAO Council on the outcomes of HLSC/2010, the Air Navigation Commission recommended that development of the new Annex 19 follow a two-phased approach. The focus of the first phase was to establish the safety management annex through the consolidation and reorganization of existing Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS). The first edition of Annex 19 became applicable on 14 November 2013. All of the safety management provisions in Annex 19 except those listed below were transferred or duplicated from safety management provisions previously contained in six other Annexes. The new provisions were as follows: The Safety Management System (SMS) framework now applies to organisations responsible for the type design and manufacture of aircraft. The four existing components of the State Safety Programme (SSP) framework - Safety Policy and Objectives, Risk Management, Safety Assurance and Safety Promotion are raised to the status of Standards. The State Safety Oversight System is now applicable to the oversight of all product and service providers. Safety Data Collection Analysis and Exchange becomes part of the SSP. The Annex also replicated Attachment ‘E’ to Annex 14 “Legal Guidance for the Protection of Safety Information from Safety Data” as Attachment ‘B’. The second phase of the development of Annex 19 was completed with the adoption Amendment 1 to the annex. Amendment 1 was adopted by the ICAO Council on 2 March 2016, effective on 11 July 2016, and applicable on 7 Nov. 2019. The adoption of Amendment 1 resulted in the second edition of Annex 19 being published.
