The non-text data (demographics, threat and error codes, outcomes coded numerically) can be exported to a statistical programme that will allow quicker analyses. (Again, each table would be a separate data set in the statistical programme.) Frequencies and percentages can be derived quickly. Questions that can be answered include: What percentage of threats/errors was mismanaged? Of all the threats, how many involved equipment? Which centre had more undesired states? The analyst can also cross-tabulate the different types of errors with outcome to determine what types of errors are more likely to be mismanaged. As the analyst becomes more and more familiar with the “peculiarities” of the data (e.g. higher than expected frequencies, high mismanagement rates for certain errors) he or she will go between the numerical data and the tables containing text, refining searches until the issue can be pinpointed. For example, if centre X appears to have a higher number of airborne threats and more mismanaged airborne threats, the analyst can select those observations that had the mismanaged airborne threats and read what the observers wrote in order to get a more comprehensive picture, and draw conclusions. The better the analyst becomes acquainted with the data, the more specific his/her queries will be. As long as the data have been structured in a flexible format, such as suggested above, the answers can be found.
