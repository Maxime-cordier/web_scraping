The explanatory material of ESARR 4 requirements, published by EUROCONTROL, lists some important benefits of using quantitative approach in estimating and measuring safety levels: There is an added value in using quantitative objectives, as it avoids diverging understandings by the various organisations and States on the range of frequencies of occurrences included in a risk classification scheme;. Quantitative criteria provide a clear target and, when derived and applied to lower level events, allow manufacturers to get on designing their equipment without having to analyse the entire system;. The safety performance measurement of actual safety occurrences may enable the verification a posteriori of whether or not allocated quantitative objectives are being met;. In addition to the measurement of accidents and serious incidents rates, the feedback from experience on events of a lower level would enable measurement of the effectiveness of the qualitative risk assessment processes and the identification of related appropriate “good working practices” to be used as acceptable measures to show compliance with quantified objectives..
