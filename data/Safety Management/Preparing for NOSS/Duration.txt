When considering the very first preparatory activities for a NOSS as the starting point, and the delivery of the final report as the end point, the duration of a NOSS may be anywhere between 6 and 9 months. This period however will most likely be experienced as such only at the NOSS project management level. For the operational staff in an organisation, the starting point will probably be perceived to be the first day of the data collection phase. Therefore, to the operational staff, the duration of the NOSS project will appear to be in the order of 2 to 4 months, depending on the time required to analyse the data and prepare the report. The duration of the data collection period is to a large extent determined by the number of observations that need to be scheduled. As a general guideline though it is recommended to collect the data in a period of one or two months, in order to provide flexibility in rostering observers, prevent observers from becoming fatigued, prevent the observed staff from tiring of the constant presence of observers, and capture data over a wider time frame which will provide a more representative depiction of the operation. During this period the collection of data is not necessarily a continuous process, i.e. the NOSS observations do not have to take place every day in this period. If data were to be collected over a period longer than two months, however, there is a risk that organisational momentum and focus may be lost.
