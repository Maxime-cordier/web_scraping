According to Article 5 of the Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 on reporting, analysis and follow-up of occurrences in civil aviation, “Each Member State shall establish a voluntary reporting system to facilitate the collection of: (a) details of occurrences that may not be captured by the mandatory reporting system; (b) other safety-related information which is perceived by the reporter as an actual or potential hazard to aviation safety”. Member States are advised, when implementing such voluntary reporting systems, to establish the conditions for de-identification of voluntary reports presented under such systems. This will enable the dissemination of important safety information derived from the analysis of the confidential reporting to all parties so that it can be used for improving safety of aviation.
