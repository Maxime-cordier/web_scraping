Being predictive is based on events – and preventing negative outcomes. If we act on negative outcomes, it is at best proactive, and normally reactive risk management. There are two keys to being predictive, particularly in a reactive world: Have the data to verify the risk and show it is worth addressing, and;. Have the support of the decision makers.. The key to both of these is data. Data will enable us to use our predictive capabilities to further reduce risk. Decision makers, including individuals, organizations, and the safety and regulatory systems themselves, are reactive by nature. However, with today’s data capabilities we can hopefully use predictive risk management to generate a risk reduction action before an accident. By utilizing incident and normal operational data in our prediction process we will be able to show that we reduced the risk of an accident and hopefully avoid having to react to one.
