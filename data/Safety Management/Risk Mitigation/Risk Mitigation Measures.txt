Risk mitigation measures are introduced with the objective to: Eliminate the risk; or. Mitigate the risk, if elimination is not feasible; or. Cope with it, if neither elimination nor mitigation is feasible.. The identification of appropriate risk mitigation measures requires a good understanding of the hazard and the factors contributing to its occurrence, since any mechanism that will be effective in reducing risk will have to modify one or more of these factors. Risk mitigation measures may work by reducing the probability of occurrence, or the severity of the consequences, or both. Achieving the desired level of risk reduction may require the implementation of more than one mitigation measure. According to ICAO Doc 9859 - Safety Management Manual, the possible approaches to risk mitigation include: Revision of the system design (before system implementation);. Modification of operational procedures;. Changes to staffing arrangements; and. Training of personnel to deal with the hazard.. The expected safety improvement potential of any proposed risk mitigation measure must be assessed by examining closely whether the implementation of the mitigation measure might introduce new risk in the system. This is done by applying the hazard identification and risk assessment steps and evaluating the acceptability of the risk with the proposed mitigation measures in place. Furthermore, safety performance monitoring should be used to evaluate the effect from the implementation of the risk mitigation measures. It is important to verify that the mitigation measures are working as intended.
