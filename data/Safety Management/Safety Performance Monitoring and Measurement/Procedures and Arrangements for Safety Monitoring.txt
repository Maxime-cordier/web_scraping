The size and structure of the organisation, and the operational environment have to be considered when setting up safety monitoring arrangements in the organisation. The guidance material developed by EUROCONTROL suggests the following basic steps for establishing effective safety monitoring and measurement processes: Identification of indicators to be monitored. The scope of monitoring should cover operational, technical and organisational (safety management) aspects. Safety indicators can be quantitative or qualitative, leading (proactive) or lagging (reactive). Collation of the information for safety monitoring. There should be a systematic collation and evaluation of results from all safety monitoring activities to ensure that interrelationships can be detected. Analysis of indicators. The evolution of the indicators should be analysed, trends and related causes and influencing factors established. Application of corrective action process. Corrective actions should be determined, taken and followed up wherever the monitoring shows that an element is approaching a point which may affect safety to an unacceptable extent; coordination with relevant units/organisations should take place wherever necessary; the indicators and their evolution should be documented as well as actions taken and their results.
