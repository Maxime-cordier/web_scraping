Safety performance monitoring and measurement is one of three elements that comprise the safety assurance component of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) safety management system (SMS) framework. Safety assurance consists of processes and activities undertaken by the service provider to determine whether the SMS is operating according to expectations and requirements. Safety performance monitoring and measurement represents the means to verify the safety performance of the organisation and to validate the effectiveness of safety risk controls. (ICAO Doc 9859 - Safety Management Manual) EUROCONTROL has defined it as a systematic action conducted to detect changes affecting the air traffic management (ATM) system with the specific objective of identifying that acceptable or tolerable safety can be met.
