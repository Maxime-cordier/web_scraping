The ICAO NOSS Manual advises on cautionary presentation of the NOSS report to the organisation by stating that: “The NOSS report contains a significant amount of statistical data that are best interpreted by someone having a firm understanding of the underlying theoretical foundation established by the TEM framework to ensure effective insight into, and consensus on, safety trends and to avoid potential misinterpretation.” For example, certain patterns of errors may be interpreted as reflecting non-standard practices of a particular group, when in fact the patterns of errors are highlighting some aspect of the operational environment (e.g. airspace design, procedures) that is leading to such errors. For this reason it is unwise that the raw statistical data be released for general consumption. It is more useful if information from the report is used for specific briefings at an appropriate level for each of the projected audiences. This does not mean that information should be excluded or added for specific groups, but rather the style and level of the presentation should be varied. The most logical persons to prepare and present those briefings are the project manager and the facilitator (if applicable). It should be highlighted at all briefings that while formally the delivery of the report is the final outcome of NOSS, it also is the starting point of a safety management process that will evaluate the report findings in conjunction with other information sources within the organisation. It should also be stressed that not all findings highlighted in the report will necessarily be acted on, particularly when the level of risk they pose can be adequately managed.
