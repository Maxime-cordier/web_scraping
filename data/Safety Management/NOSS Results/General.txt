As Normal Operations Safety Survey (NOSS) is a diagnostic tool only, it provides an overview of the “Threat and Error Management (TEM) strengths and weaknesses” of the ATC operations observed, but it does not provide any remedies or solutions for problem areas that may have been identified. In that respect the NOSS report is the start rather than the end of a safety management process. The ATS organisation receiving the report must act on the findings presented in it for the report (and thereby the NOSS project) to have any noticeable effects on safety in the organisation.
