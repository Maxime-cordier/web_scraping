The recommendations from the NOSS report will indicate targets in the organisation for safety enhancements. Yet it is up to the organisation to determine which changes are going to be made and at what moment in time in the operational processes. The NOSS recommendations can be integrated with those from other elements of the safety management system in the organisation, e.g. incident investigation or voluntary reporting systems. By doing so it is likely that the organisation will apply its resources in the best possible way to enhance safety in its operations. Guidance on which targets to select first is difficult to provide for it will depend greatly on the particular circumstances of the operations of each ATS provider. Threats that occur infrequently but are often mismanaged would be a category of potential targets. However this applies similarly for threats that occur frequently and are generally well managed, e.g. runway crossings by tow aircraft and/or service vehicles. Even though the crossings appear to be well managed by the ATC crews, close attention of the controllers is required each and every time the runway is crossed. By constructing a taxi track or service road around the runway, the threat can be removed (or its frequency of occurring reduced), thus making the operation more safe and potentially increasing the runway capacity at the same time.
