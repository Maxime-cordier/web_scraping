After a NOSS has been conducted, the results of the report have been analysed and processed by the ATS provider and appropriate safety changes have been proposed and implemented. NOSS can be used as a tool to measure the effectiveness of the changes made. To that end a follow-up NOSS can be conducted on the same target(s), and the results of this second NOSS can be compared with those of the first one. It is recommended to allow an adequate time span between successive NOSSs with the same target(s), in order for safety changes to take effect before they are re-measured. For a follow-up NOSS the same preparations are required as for a first NOSS (e.g. the publicity phase, observer selection, observer training), even though the same individuals may be involved. Since participating in a NOSS is not a part of an everyday routine, an individual’s skills and knowledge about the process will have faded and need to be re-built just as carefully as the first time. Once a NOSS project has been successfully concluded, the ATS provider may decide to conduct another NOSS at a different location and/or with a different target (which could be a smaller element of the first NOSS). There is no need to wait a number of years to conduct this “new” NOSS, for it will constitute a “first” for the location or target where it is conducted. If a sufficient number of different locations and/or targets can be selected, an organisation can design a multi-year NOSS programme that successively covers the operations in periodic cycles.
