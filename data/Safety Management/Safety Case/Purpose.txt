“Primarily the Safety Case is a matter of ensuring that every company produces a formal safety assessment to assure itself that its operations are safe. Only secondarily is it a matter of demonstrating this to a regulatory body. That said such a demonstration both meets a legitimate expectation of the workforce and the public and provides a sound basis for regulatory control” (Lord Cullen, in investigation of Piper Alpha accident) ICAO Annex 11 places an obligation on the providers of Air Traffic Management services to ensure the safety of air traffic, in respect of those parts of the ATM System and supporting services within their managerial control. Implicit to this obligation is the requirement on those with managerial control to demonstrate positively that the relevant Safety Regulations are satisfied. In essence there is a “burden of proof” on Air Navigation Service Providers to show that acceptable levels of safety are and continue to be achieved.
