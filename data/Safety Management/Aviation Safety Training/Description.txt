Recent developments in aviation have indicated a need to focus more closely on a formal approach to aviation safety. The introduction of new industry requirements, underpinned by ICAO Standards, has brought new structures and processes for the formal management and regulation of aviation safety. These developments have led to a need for operators, service-providers and regulators to enhance the expertise of their safety personnel, including through the introduction of a wide range of formal training programmes. According to ICAO Doc 9859 - Safety Management Manual safety training and education is an important element of the safety promotion component of the safety management system (SMS).
