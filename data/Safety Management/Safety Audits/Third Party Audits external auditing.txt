The organisation’s management or the regulator may decide to have an external agency carry out an independent safety audit. ICAO Doc 9859 specifies that: “External audits of the SMS may be conducted by relevant authorities responsible for acceptance of the service provider’s SMS. Additionally, audits may be conducted by industry associations or other third parties selected by the service provider. These external audits enhance the internal audit system as well as provide independent oversight.” An organisation which possesses the necessary expertise and technical experience to verify on behalf of a State authority the compliance of an air navigation service provider with the applicable regulatory requirements is called a qualified entity. An organisation wishing to become qualified entity must be certified by a State authority in accordance with the provisions of the SES Service provision regulation.
