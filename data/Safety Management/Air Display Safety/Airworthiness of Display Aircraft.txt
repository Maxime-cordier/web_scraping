Although in the now distant past, un-airworthy aircraft were a significant cause of air display accidents, this is not the case today. However, airworthiness contributory factors are still sometimes identified in air display accident investigations and appear to be most often encountered when relatively few of an older aircraft type remain and/or aircraft are operated under a 'Permit to Fly' regime or similar regime which is less restrictive than the full requirement for issue of airworthiness certification.
