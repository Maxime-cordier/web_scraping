It is vital that all parties involved in air display activity have a shared situational awareness which should be coordinated by the FDD. These parties include the pilots taking part, the affected ATC and/or FIS units, personnel responsible for spectator control and relevant agencies directly responsible for public safety both in and outside the aerodrome or other designated display area. Of critical importance to all is an understanding of the approved 'display line' along which display aircraft will orient their manoeuvre(s). This will determine the proximity of both spectators and uninvolved third parties to risk from display aircraft and where a display is taking place at an aerodrome, will almost always be along a runway. Many civil and military agencies/organisations responsible for risk management have established requirements for minimum distances between the display line and the (parallel) crowd line. These are dependent on the nature of each aircraft, the speeds at which it will be flown and the degree to which any aerobatic flight manoeuvres will feature. Although it does not have as its primary purpose the creation of shared situational awareness, the process of Pre Display Briefing of all who will be involved, which is in its own right a critical enabler of operational safety, is an important part of this. Once in possession of all the necessary information and having satisfied themselves that risk mitigation is adequate, a FDD should be expected to provide a written briefing to all parties, followed up by verbal briefings - conducted face-to-face or by telephone - on the day of the event in good time before it begins.
