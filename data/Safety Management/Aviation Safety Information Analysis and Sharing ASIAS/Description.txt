The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) often describes Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) as an evolving program enabling “users to perform integrated queries across multiple databases, search an extensive warehouse of safety data, and display pertinent elements in an array of useful formats.” ASIAS actually ranks as a central conduit for the voluntary exchange of safety information between the FAA and the U.S. aviation community, and a national resource for the aggregation, analysis and dissemination of aviation safety analysis, FAA said. FAA’s 2019 Aviation Safety Workforce Plan added, “ASIAS partners with the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) and the General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) to monitor known risks, evaluate the effectiveness of deployed mitigations, and detect emerging hazards.”
