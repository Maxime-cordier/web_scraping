“The goal of ASIAS to provide a reliable source of information to the aviation community that will be used to impact safety decisions and reduce the risk of accidents,” the ASIAS Internet portal said. Principles and governance protocols ensure that ASIAS information will be used only for safety purposes, and not for punitive action, FAA said. ASIAS primarily supports the GAJSC by using de-identified general aviation operations data to help identify risks and evaluate the effectiveness of deployed solutions. The twice-a-year, industry-sponsored Aviation Safety InfoShare meeting also heavily involves ASIAS in facilitating confidential sharing of safety issues and best practices in a protected (non-public) environment. InfoShare enables ASIAS to gain insight into safety issues and leverage its data repository to identify emerging systemic safety issues within the National Airspace System (NAS). As of 30 November 2020, ASIAS participants comprised five civil/military government entities (including the FAA); 40 Part 121 U.S. air carriers; 16 aviation industry companies and associations; 130 corporate/business operators, 15 university/academy flight training entities; five aircraft manufacturers; and two maintenance, repair, and overhaul organizations. The most prominent databases used come from the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP); Airport Surface Detection Equipment–Model X (ASDE–X); Airspace Performance Metrics (ASPM); Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS); Air Traffic Safety Action Program (ATSAP); Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA); Meteorological Aviation Report (METAR); Mandatory Occurrence Reports (MOR); National Flight Data Center (NFDC); Near Mid-Air Collisions (NMAC); National Offload Program aircraft-track data (NOP); Service Difficulty Reports (SDR); and, the Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS). The highly networked ASIAS data repositories include FAA data (i.e., surveillance radar data and navigational information), airline operator proprietary safety data (i.e., digital flight data and safety reports), publicly available safety data, manufacturer information, and other data from flight operations and air traffic control entities in the NAS, FAA said.
