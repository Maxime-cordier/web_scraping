The purpose of the tool is to perform measurement, analysis and reporting dealing with in-flight operational performance of commercial aircraft. AirFASE is designed to be integrated into the airline’s FOM (Flight Operations Monitoring) system, also known as Flight Data Monitoring (Flight Data Monitoring) or FOQA (Flight Operations Quality Assurance). AirFASE allows an airline’s Flight Operations and/or Safety Management departments to review line operations of a specific fleet with a dedicated route structure.
