In Europe, EUROCONTROL measures the maturity of ANSPsâ€™ safety management systems using a dedicated survey methodology. The Safety Maturity Survey Framework establishes the extent of progress made by ANSPs with respect to the introduction of ATM safety management systems and how the SMS framework relates to safety in operations and engineering. The measurements are not a replica of an audit and are not based on detailed evidences. The maturity survey is based on self assessment which is verified during a telephone or face-to-face interview. The new methodology, applied from 2010 onwards, has strengthened the verification mechanism through a series of additional validation activities agreed by service providers. The effectiveness of safety management as measured by a methodology based on the Safety Maturity Survey Framework will become the first safety key performance indicator for the European service providers in the context of the implementation of the Single European Sky II legislation.
