The Multi-Crew Pilot License (MPL) was adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in 2006 as as an amendment to Annex 1, Personnel Licensing. The details of the requirements for the licence are contained in Annex 1 and in the Procedures for Air Navigation Services - Training (PANS-TRG), Doc 9868t. According to information on ICAO's website, "The MPL allows a pilot to exercise the privileges of a co-pilot in a commercial air transportation on multi-crew aeroplanes. It provides the aviation community with an opportunity to train pilots directly for co-pilot duties. ... The licence focuses on ab initio airline pilot training. MPL training and assessment will be competency-based and involve a multi-crew environment and threat and error management from the onset. It provides for greater use of flight simulation training devices and include mandatory upset training."
