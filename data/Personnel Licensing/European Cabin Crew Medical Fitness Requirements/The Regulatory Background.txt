The European Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 lays down the technical requirements and administrative procedures for civil aviation aircrew in EU and EEA countries. In respect of Cabin Crew, it establishes Implementing Rules for their periodic aero-medical assessment and the conditions under which general medical practitioners may act as aero-medical examiners. These rules also cover the conditions for issuing, maintaining, amending, limiting, suspending or revoking attestations of cabin crew medical fitness and detail both the privileges and responsibilities of the holders of such attestations. The above Regulation has seven Annexes. Annex IV is known as Part-MED and contains the EASA Implementing Rules (IRs) for medical assessment of both pilots and cabin crew. Subpart C of Part-MED contains the IRs applicable to cabin crew medical assessment.
