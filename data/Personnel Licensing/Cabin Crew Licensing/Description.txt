Article 37 of the Chicago Convention authorises the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to adopt and amend as appropriate Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) related to personnel licensing. Safety-critical personnel subject to licensing include pilots, flight navigators, flight engineers, aircraft maintenance engineers, air traffic controllers, flight dispatchers and aeronautical station operators. Unlike for pilots and other safety-critical personnel, there is not a global requirement that cabin crew, or flight attendants, be certificated or licensed in order to work in air carrier or commercial operations. Some States, however, set standards for flight attendant training programs in their national regulatory structures. Transport Canada, for example, requires that commercial air carriers that employ flight attendants “must have an approved training program” that follows the Flight Attendant Training Standard (TP12296). Transport Canada also requires that certain content be included in flight attendant manuals, including information on safety and emergency procedures, first aid, safety and emergency equipment, and aircraft-specific information about procedures and equipment. Both the European Community (EC) and the United States require some form of cabin crew certification for individuals wishing to work in commercial air transportation.
