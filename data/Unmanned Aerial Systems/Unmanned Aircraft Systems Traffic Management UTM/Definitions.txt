The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM) as a traffic management ecosystem for uncontrolled operations that is separate from, but complementary to, FAA's air traffic management (ATM) system. The FAA, NASA, other federal partner agencies, and industry are collaborating to explore concepts of operation, data exchange requirements, and a supporting framework to enable multiple, beyond visual line-of-sight [BVLOS] drone operations at low altitudes (under 400 ft above ground level [AGL]) in airspace where FAA air traffic services are not provided. â€¦
