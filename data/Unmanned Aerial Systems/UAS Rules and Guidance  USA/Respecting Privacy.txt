Although Pasrt 107 does not specifically deal with privacy issues in the use of drones, and the FAA does not regulate how UAS gather data on people or property, the FAA strongly encourages all UAS pilots to check local and state laws before gathering information through remote sensing technology or photography. The FAA will provide all drone users with recommended privacy guidelines. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) offers guidelines and best practices for UAS pilots.
