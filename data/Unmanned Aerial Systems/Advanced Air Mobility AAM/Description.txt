The term UAM has been used within and outside aviation since around 2017 to describe an eco-system in which remotely piloted or autonomous air vehicles will be capable of routinely flying published routes above cities (and their aerodromes) at low levels, or conducting short-range flights between metropolitan areas. As UAM research by NASA and others continued, it became clear that UAM-related services could benefit a broader group that just people who live in large cities. Thus the decision by NASA, and subsequently the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to begin using advanced air mobility instead. In July 2020, FAA said it was formalizing use the of the term AAM. NASA said its vision for AAM is “to help emerging aviation markets to safely develop an air transportation system that moves people and cargo between places previously not served or underserved by aviation – local, regional, intraregional, urban – using revolutionary new aircraft that are only just now becoming possible.”
