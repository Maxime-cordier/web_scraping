ESARR 4 develops further ESARR3 requirements on risk assessment and mitigation and documentation of the process, its results and conclusions. This requirement concerns the use of a quantitative risk based-approach in ATM when introducing and/or planning changes to the ATM system. It covers the human, procedural and equipment (hardware, software) elements of the ATM system, as well as its environment of operations. ESARR 4 covers the complete life-cycle of the ATM system, and, in particular, its constituent parts. The assessment of planned and/or implemented organisational or management changes to the ATM service provision are outside the scope of the requirement. The objective of this requirement is to ensure that the risks associated with hazards in the airborne and ground components of the ATM system are systematically and formally identified, assessed, and managed within safety levels, which as a minimum, meet those approved by the designated safety regulatory authority.
