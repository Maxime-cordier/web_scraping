As shown above, the implementation of the ESARRs by ANSPs is, in the case of some ESARRs, in advance of the publication of relevant regulation by the state regulatory authority. However, the overall implementation of the ESARRs is lagging behind schedule. This is particularly the case for ESARR4 where ANSPs report problems with the quantitative aspects of the regulation. The publication of the Common Requirements and the certification process may put impetus in the coming year to the implementation of the relevant ESARRs.
