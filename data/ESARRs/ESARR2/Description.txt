ESARR 2 mandates the implementation of a harmonised occurrence reporting and assessment scheme by EUROCONTROL member states. European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) member states who are not members of EUROCONTROL are also encouraged to apply it. The requirement promotes a consistent and systematic reporting and assessment process, encourages the establishment of a non-punitive environment and is designed to act as an effective contribution to accident and serious risk bearing incident prevention. ESARR 2 defines: Requirements on the main phases of the occurrence reporting and assessment process: occurrence reporting; data collection, data analysis, risk classification, recommendation formulation; recommendation implementation and monitoring; safety data and experience exchange.. The ATM-related occurrences which shall, as a minimum, be reported and assessed by States.. The minimum appropriate safety data which shall be collated and reported to EUROCONTROL by States, expressed in terms of high level safety indicators.. Harmonised terms and definitions..
