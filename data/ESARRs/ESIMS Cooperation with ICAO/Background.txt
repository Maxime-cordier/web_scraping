The ICAO Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme (USOAP) was launched in January 1999 in response to widespread concerns expressed regarding the apparent inability of some Contracting States to carry out their safety oversight functions. The scope of the Programme was initially limited to Annex 1 (Personnel Licensing), Annex 6 (Operation of Aircraft) and Annex 8 (Airworthiness of Aircraft), but was extended in 2005 to all safety-related Annexes, including those relating to Air Navigation Services (ANS), also providing transition to a comprehensive systems approach for the conduct of safety oversight audits. In November 2002, the EUROCONTROL Permanent Commission approved the establishment of the ESARR Implementation Monitoring and Support (ESARR Implementation Monitoring and Support (ESIMS)) Programme. The Programme was updated and was introduced in 2005 to assess, through a formal and detailed audit process, States’ safety oversight arrangements and capabilities. The ESIMS Programme came to an end in 2012 being succeeded by the EASA standardisation inspections. ESIMS audits used to cover all applicable regulations related to the implementation of ATM safety oversight by a State, as well as the procedures, the resourcing of functions and other implementing arrangements needed to implement, in respect to ATM, the Eight Critical Elements of a State’s Safety Oversight System defined in ICAO Document 9734-A.
