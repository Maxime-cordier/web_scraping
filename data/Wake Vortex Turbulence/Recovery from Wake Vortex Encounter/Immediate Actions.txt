In the event of a Wake Vortex Encounter, pilots should immediately take the following actions: Power - Whenever you are low and slow as will be the case in a WVE during approach, add the power - you'll need it. Push - Unload the wings or "push" on the yoke until you are slightly "light in the seat". This reduces the angle of attack of the wings which gives better roll control with the ailerons. It simultaneously reduces the drag on the aircraft for better acceleration and, if you are rolling over, slows your descent towards the ground.. Roll - If aircraft controlability allows a choice, roll (unloaded) to the nearest horizon. If there isnâ€™t a nearest horizon, or if you have significant rolling momentum, continue to roll (unloaded) in that direction to the horizon.. Go Around - Do not try to salvage a landing after a WVE during approach. Depending upon the atmospheric conditions, there is a risk of re-entering the wake vortex from the preceeding aircraft later in the approach at a lower altitude where a recovery might not be successful..
