Amendment 9 to Doc 4444 PANS-ATM (applicability date 5 November 2020) incorporates various provisions from the Airbus A380 Wake Vortex Guidance Material. Most of those are in line with the study recommendations described in the previous sections. The only exception is the proposed by the study radar wake turbulence separation minimum of 6 nm for heavy aircraft behind an A-380. The ICAO Doc 4444 provision sets the required ("legal") minimum to 5 nm (Doc 4444, Section 8.7.3.4).
