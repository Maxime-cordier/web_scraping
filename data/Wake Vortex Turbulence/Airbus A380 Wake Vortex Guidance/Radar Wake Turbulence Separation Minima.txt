The following wake turbulence radar separation minima should be applied to aircraft in the approach and departure phases of flight. The minima should be applied when: an aircraft is operating directly behind an A380-800 aircraft at the same altitude or less than 300 m (1 000 ft) below; or. both aircraft are using the same runway, or parallel runways separated by less than 760 m; or. an aircraft is crossing behind an A380-800 aircraft, at the same altitude or less than 300 m (1 000 ft) below.. Further information about en-route separation minima is provided in an Airbus presentation A380 wake vortex working processes and status (see Further Reading):
