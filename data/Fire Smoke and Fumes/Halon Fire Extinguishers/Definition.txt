Halons are fire extinguishing agents which are gaseous when discharged in the aircraft environment. Halons have, until recently, been in almost universal use in aircraft fire extinguishers, both portable and fixed. They exist in two forms - as Halon 1211, BromoChlorodiFluoromethane (CBrClF2) also known as 'BCF', and as Halon 1301, Bromotrifluoromethane (CBrF3). Halon 1211 is used only in portable extinguishers and is a streaming agent. Halon 1301 is used only in fixed extinguisher installations typically cargo holds or engines and is a total flooding agent..
