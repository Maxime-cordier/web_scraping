Halons are electrically non-conducting and have been acknowledged as the most effective universal extinguishing agent for aircraft use. They work mainly by chemically interrupting the reaction described as the 'Fire Triangle' (Fuel-Oxygen-Heat) which must be sustained for a fire to continue. They do not produce residues and therefore do not cause secondary damage. However, the fumes are toxic if inhaled and all practicable precautions should be taken when they are used. The chemical constituents in Halon gases, and the products of the reactions they induce when discharged on fires, have been identified as causing damage to the Ozone layer. As a result, their manufacture and use have been banned for many years in most countries and non-essential uses have been eliminated. However, the search for alternatives of comparable effectiveness has proved difficult and success limited, so they remain in wide use on board aircraft for most applications.
