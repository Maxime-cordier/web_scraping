Smoke Hoods are protective head coverings which, as a minimum, have a filter system that prevents wearers from breathing in unwanted smoke gases and particulates generated in a fire. They may also incorporate a small oxygen generator by which their useful endurance as a protective device is increased. They are made of a heat resistant material which is able to retain its integrity up to temperatures in excess of 350 degrees Celsius.
