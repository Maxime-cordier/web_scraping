Smoke Hoods are now routinely provided for Cabin Crew but, despite years of debate dating back to as long ago as an NPRM (Notice of Proposed Rule Making) issued by the FAA in 1969, they have not yet been approved for passenger use. Should smoke hoods ever be approved for passenger use, they will clearly have a lower performance requirement, which will reduce their weight and complexity so that their rare use by people with only the guidance of a cabin safety briefing and instruction cards is likely to be practicable. It is mainly concerns at the range of passenger abilities to use such equipment, and awareness of experience with passenger oxygen mask use during cabin de-pressurisations, which has prevented the adoption of smoke hoods for passengers so far.
