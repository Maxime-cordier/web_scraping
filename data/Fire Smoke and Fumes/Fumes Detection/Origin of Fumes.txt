The origin of fumes may be local to the source, as in the case of faulty electrical equipment, the overheated contents of a galley oven, or a failed cabin fluorescent light fitting; or it may be distributed from the source through the cabin air conditioning system. In the latter case, it can be extremely difficult to be sure of the cause, or whether the fumes could be in any way be related to a fire hazard.
