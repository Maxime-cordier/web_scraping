quantity of PEDs and lithium batteries carried by individual passengers and crewmembers for their personal use. Normally, PEDs and spare lithium batteries with power less than 100 Watt-hours are permitted without a limit on quantity (for non-rechargeable lithium-metal spare batteries, however, the limit is a total weight of 2 gr of lithium-metal content). Lithium batteries of higher power capacity are limited to one installed in a device and two spares, limited to approved professional uses and possibly subject to advance approval of carriage by the airline or a security agency.
