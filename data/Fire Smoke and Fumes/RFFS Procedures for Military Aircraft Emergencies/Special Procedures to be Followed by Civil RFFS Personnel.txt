The advice in this section is derived from training materials and is intended to provide general guidance about procedures and factors to be considered by RFFS personnel. It is not intended to supersede local instructions. RFFS personnel should be aware of the fact that the absence of external weapons does not necessarily mean there are no weapons at all. Relevant information about the armament should be obtained from the military.. Personnel and apparatus should not be positioned in line with gun ports.. Explosive devices should only be dealt with by military EOD personnel. When an aircraft is carrying explosives the prime effort must be directed toward accomplishing a quick knockdown of the fire and cooling of the munitions to maintain a survivable environment.. Firefighting should not be attempted when weapons are involved unless it is possible to extinguish the fire quickly. Because of the potential of detonation, all firefighters should withdraw at least 600m.. Ignition or detonation of high explosive is very unlikely if its temperature can be kept below 150Â°C. Pyrotechnics present at least minor explosive hazard. They burn very hot and may ignite surrounding combustibles. Most pyrotechnics burn rapidly and once ignited they are very difficult to extinguish as they contain their own oxidisers.. Ejection systems should be treated with caution by RFFS personnel. Improper opening of a hatch could cause the seat to fire unless it is safetied. Procedures for seat safetying differ from aircraft to aircraft and therefore assistance from trained personnel is recommended..
