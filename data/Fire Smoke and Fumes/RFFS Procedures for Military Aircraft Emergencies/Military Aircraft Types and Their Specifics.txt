The military use a variety of aircraft for a wide range of purposes. All military aircraft can potentially have self protection equipment consisting of chaff and/or flare dispensers which can create a threat to RFFS personnel. Other specific threats by aircraft role include: Fighter and attack aircraft (e.g. F-16, A-10) - the main hazards are the presence of weapon systems (ammunition, rockets/missiles) and survival systems (e.g. ejection seats);. Bomber aircraft (e.g. B-52) - the main hazards are the presence of potentially large quantities of weapons or ammunition (e.g. bombs), fuel and survival systems (e.g. ejection seats);. Cargo aircraft (e.g. C-130) - there is nothing specific about the aircraft itself but the cargo may be hazardous (weapons, ammunition, etc.);. Tanker aircraft (e.g. BOEING KC-135) - the main hazard is the possibly exceptional fuel load.. Utility aircraft - they are similar to general aviation aircraft and pose no specific threats to ground personnel;. Special purpose aircraft (e.g. BOEING E-3D Sentry AWACS) - these aircraft carry special equipment for particular purposes; generally they are similar to commercial airliners and pose no specific threats to ground personnel;. Helicopters - the main hazard is the potential presence of weapon systems. Cargo helicopters may have dangerous goods on board (e.g. ammunition).
