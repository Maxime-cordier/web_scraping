In a smoke filled cabin, passengers and crew may quickly lose situational awareness. It is usual for smoke to fill the cabin from the roof down, obscuring sources of illumination in the ceiling and overhead panels. Emergency floor path illumination provides guidance to passengers in an evacuation. Emergency floor path illumination is not necessarily 'lighting' - photo luminescent strips are widely used because they are independent of the aircraft electrical system.
