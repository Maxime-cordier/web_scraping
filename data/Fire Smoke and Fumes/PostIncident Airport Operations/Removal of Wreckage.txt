If the accident involves personal injury or death, the aircraft wreckage should not be removed without clearance from the National CAA and the aircraft owner. However, if aircraft or parts must be moved prior to completion of a full investigation (because they represent a hazard to life or property), a record must be made of the locations of all parts, and care exercised to preserve any evidence that might help determine the cause of the accident. As soon as practical following an incident, the owner or operator shall be advised that the aircraft must be removed. Following removal of the wreckage, the responsible airport authorities must inspect the runway/taxiway pavement and surrounding surfaces for damage and debris and, if satisfactory, the airport may be reopened to air traffic. If a runway is to remain closed, it should be marked according the ICAO SARPs provisions in Annex 14.
