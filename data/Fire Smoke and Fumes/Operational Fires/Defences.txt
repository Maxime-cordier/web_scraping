Modern aircraft are designed and equipped with the possibility of a fire in mind. Aircraft engines, including the APU have fire detection and fire extinguishing systems installed. Overheat detectors are installed in the vicinity of bleed air ducts and the bleed system is designed so it can be partially or totally isolated if required. Brake temperature indicators may be installed and will give indication of a brake or tyre fire. Lavatories are equipped with smoke detectors and lavatory waste bins have automatic fire suppression equipment. Fire-fighting equipment is carried in the flight deck and the cabin. Above all else, both flight deck and cabin crew are well trained in dealing with all fire, smoke and fume emergencies. They are well supported in this endeavour by the Crash Fire Rescue personnel manning the aerodrome fire stations.
