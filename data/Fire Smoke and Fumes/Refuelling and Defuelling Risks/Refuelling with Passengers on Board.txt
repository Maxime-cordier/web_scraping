Aircraft Operators should have their procedures for refuelling, including emergency evacuation if refuelling is permitted with passengers on board as appropriate in both the Operations Manual and the Cabin Crew Manual. Crew stations and duties should be clearly defined as should appropriate passenger communications. Procedures for Emergency Passenger Evacuation should take account of the availability or otherwise of airbridge access and in-position ground steps in the selection of exits to be used. Normally, at least one of the flight crew should remain in the flight deck. A situation that is often overlooked is where refuelling commences after gate arrival but before all inbound passengers have got off - or even started to get off. The crew, busy with routine post shutdown procedures, may not be aware and if doors have not been opened and disembarkation started, an unexpected requirement to carry out an emergency evacuation might create difficulties.
