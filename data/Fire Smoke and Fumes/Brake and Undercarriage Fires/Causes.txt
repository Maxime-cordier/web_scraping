As per the Fire Triangle, a fire requires three items; a heat source, fuel and oxygen. Brake and undercarriage fires are no exception. Oxygen is always available when the undercarriage is extended and will also be available in the more confined area of undercarriage bay when retracted. The most common source of heat is from the brakes and events such as a rejected takeoff, sequential stop and go landing events during circuit training, or overuse of, or a dragging brake during taxi can all result in extreme brake temperatures. Underinflated tyres can cause additional load and strain on the other tyre on the axle and can also lead to elevated temperatures in the tyre itself and in the undercarriage bay when the wheels are retracted. The most common fuel source on the undercarriage is the grease used to lubricate the wheel bearings, brake assemblies and retraction mechanisms. If undercarriage components are over-lubricated or if old grease is not removed during wheel changes, an excessive amount of grease can accumulate and result in a fire if heated to its flashpoint. Aircraft tyres, leaking hydraulic fluid, and other flammables such as residual cleaning solvent from maintenance procedures or fuel leaking from a compromised tank or pipe are also potential fuel sources.
