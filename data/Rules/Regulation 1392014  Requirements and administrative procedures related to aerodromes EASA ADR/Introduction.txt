The Regulation (EU) No 139/2014 is officially referred to as IR-ADR (Implementing rules – Aerodromes), but it is more commonly known as EASA ADR. It replaces existing national requirements with regard to the management, certification and operations of aerodromes in European states. In accordance with the Basic Regulation Member States may decide to exempt from the provisions of EASA ADR an aerodrome which handles no more than 10,000 passengers per year and no more than 850 movements related to cargo operations per year. Member States are however required to examine the traffic figures of an exempted aerodrome on an annual basis. If the traffic figures at such an aerodrome have exceeded those provided for in the Basic Regulation over the last three consecutive years, Member States are required to inform EASA and revoke the exemption. The standard of reference for EASA ADR at ICAO’s level is Annex 14, Volume I, which is applicable to all aerodromes open to public use in accordance with the requirements of Article 15 of the ICAO Convention. The contents of Annex 14, Volume I, reflect the planning and design, as well as operation and maintenance, of aerodromes. The regulation is also closely based on ICAO Documents 9734 (Safety Oversight Manual) and 9774 (Manual on Certification of Aerodromes).
