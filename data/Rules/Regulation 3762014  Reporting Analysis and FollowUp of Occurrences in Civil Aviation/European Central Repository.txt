The European Commission manages a European Central Repository to store all occurrence reports collected in the EU. Each EU Member State, in agreement with the European Commission, is to update the European Central Repository by transferring to it all information relating to safety stored in the national databases. The EASA is to agree with the European Commission the technical protocols for transferring to the European Central Repository of all occurrence reports collected by EASA under Regulation (EU) No 2018/1139 and its implementing rules, particularly for occurrences stored in the Internal Occurrence Reporting System (IORS), as well as the information collected pursuant to regulation (EU) 376/2014. The European Commission, by means of implementing acts, is to adopt the arrangements for the management of the European Central Repository. The EU Member States and the EASA are to participate in an exchange of information by making all information relating to safety stored in their respective reporting databases available to the competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the EASA and the European Commission, through the European Central Repository. Occurrence reports are to be transferred to the European Central Repository no later than 30 days after having been entered in the national database. Occurrence reports are to be updated whenever necessary with additional information relating to safety.
