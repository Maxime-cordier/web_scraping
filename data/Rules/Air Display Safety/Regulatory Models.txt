Whether an Air Display is risk-managed by the military or civil authorities, it is a matter entirely within National competence, even in the case of EU Member States. The degree to which civil pilot competency and display oversight are outsourced to the potentially rather isolated 'display community' through a combination of the use of approvals of competent persons and some residual direct oversight varies considerably. For example, every approved display in the USA is attended by a member of the regulatory staff whereas in the UK only a small sample (as low as 1.4% of the 281 displays approved in 2014) are attended by a CAA representative. Some examples of freely published Guidance Material are provided in 'Further Reading' below but it must be remembered that all Guidance Material is produced in the context of a specific national application and must therefore be interpreted accordingly.
