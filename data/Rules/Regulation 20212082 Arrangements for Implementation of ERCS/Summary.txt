The ERCS addresses the safety risk of an occurrence and not its actual outcome. The assessment of each occurrence determines the worst likely accident outcome that might have happened, and how close to that accident outcome the occurrence was. The ERCS score is composed of two variables: severity: the worst likely outcome in case the occurrence had escalated into an accident. probability: the likelihood of the occurrence to escalate into that outcome. The Annex to this Regulation lays down conversion procedures from RAT (Risk Analysis Tool) and ARMS ERC (Airline Risk Management Solutions Event Risk Classification) scores to the ERCS score. The ERCS score can be obtained either by direct conversion or by using a manual conversion procedure, the former method being preferable. In any case, the aim is to achieve an equivalent ERCS classification. The conversion process is summed up in the flow chart below: On 31 March 2026 and every 5 years thereafter, each Member State will provide the European Commission and EASA with a report on the use of the ERCS. The conversion procedures will be reviewed regularly by EASA to ensure their continuing relevance.
