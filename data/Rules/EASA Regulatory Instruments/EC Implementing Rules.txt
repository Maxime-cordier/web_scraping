Article 17 of the ‘Basic Regulation’ instructs the Agency to assist the European Commission (EC) by “…preparing measures to be taken for the implementation of the [Basic] Regulation”. These measures include the preparation of draft Implementing Rules (IR’s) which are submitted to the EC (under Article 18) in the form of EASA opinions. Except for draft legislation, EASA are also empowered to issue opinions on a range of other technical and operational issues. Currently, well-established Implementing Rules are in place to support the regulation of: the airworthiness and environmental certification of aircraft and related products, parts and appliances, as well as for the certification of design and production (see Regulation (EC) 1702/2003 in "Further Reading"), and. the continuing airworthiness of aircraft and aeronautical products, parts and appliances, and on the approval of organisations and personnel involved in these tasks (see Regulation (EC) 2042/2003 in "Further Reading"). Further IRs are being developed to support the more recent expansion of EASA’s role into air operations and flight-crew licensing. In these fields, interim provisions are established through adoption of Joint Aviation Requirements developed by the JAA. In addition, following the expansion of the scope of EASA’s role to the safety regulation of airport operations and air traffic control services new IR’s are being established in this field, in conjunction with the Community legislation established for the implementation of the Single European Sky (SES).
