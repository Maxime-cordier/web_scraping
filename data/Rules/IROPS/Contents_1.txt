The Regulation consists of eight annexes (parts) with related subparts as follows: Annex I contains definitions for terms used in annexes II-VIII. Part-ARO (authority requirements for air operations) establishes requirements for EASA member statesâ€™ national aviation authorities with regard to the implementation and enforcement of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 and the certification and oversight of registered air operators. These requirements are articulated in the following series of subparts: Subpart GEN (general requirements); Subpart OPS (air operations); Subpart RAMP (ramp inspections of aircraft of operators under the regulatory oversight of another state). Part-ORO (organisation requirements for air operations) establishes organisational requirements to be followed by an air operator conducting specialised and non-specialised commercial air operations and specialised and non-specialised non-commercial air operations with complex motor-powered aircraft. These requirements are articulated in the following series of subparts: Subpart GEN (general requirements); Subpart AOC (air operator certification); Subpart DEC (declaration); Subpart SPO (commercial specialised operations); Subpart MLR (manuals, logs and records); Subpart SEC (security); Subpart FC (flight crew); Subpart CC (cabin crew); Subpart TC (technical crew in HEMS, HHO or NVIS operations); and Subpart FTL (flight and duty time limitations and rest requirements (commercial A only)). Part-CAT (commercial air transport operations) establishes organisational requirements to be followed by an air operator performing non-specialised commercial air transport operations (A, H, S and B). These requirements are articulated in the following series of subparts: Subpart A (general requirements (GEN)); Subpart B (operating procedures (OP)); Subpart C (aircraft performance and operating limitations (POL): performance classes A, B and C (A) and performance classes 1, 2 and 3 (H); mass and balance: motor-powered aircraft, sailplanes (S) and balloons (B)); and Subpart D (instruments, data and equipment (IDE)). Part-SPA (specific approvals) establishes requirements for air operations which require specific approvals. These requirements are articulated in the following series of subparts: Subpart A (general requirements (GEN)); Subpart B (performance-based navigation (PBN) operations); Subpart c (operations with specified minimum navigation performance (MNPS)); Subpart D (operations in airspace with reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM)); Subpart E (low visibility operations (LVO)); Subpart F (extended range operations with two-engined aeroplanes (ETOPS)); Subpart G (transport of dangerous goods (DG); Subpart H (helicopter operations with night vision imaging systems (NVIS)); Subpart I (helicopter hoist operations (HHO)); Subpart J (helicopter emergency medical service operations (HEMS)); Part-NCC (non-commercial air operations with complex motor-powered aircraft) establishes operational requirements for air operators conducting non-specialised non-commercial air operations with complex motor-powered aircraft. These requirements are articulated in the following series of subparts: Subpart A (general requirements (GEN)); Subpart B (operational procedures (OP)); Subpart C (aircraft performance and operating limitations (POL)); Subpart D (instruments, data and equipment (IDE)); Part-NCO (non-commercial air operations with other-than-complex motor-powered aircraft) establishes operational requirements for operators conducting non-commercial air operations with other-than-complex motor-powered aircraft (specialised and non-specialised). These requirements are articulated in the following series of subparts: Subpart A (general requirements (GEN)); Subpart B (operational procedures (OP)); Subpart C (aircraft performance and operating limitations (POL)); Subpart D (instruments, data and equipment (IDE), including requirements for sailplanes
