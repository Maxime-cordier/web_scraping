Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a highly poisonous gas and exposure can quickly lead to short-term symptoms, long-term health issues, and even death. Prolonged and repeat exposures at lower concentrations can lead to the same conclusions. CO is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas, and is a by-product of the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials. Known as the “silent killer”, poisoning from CO is responsible for more than 400 deaths per annum in the USA and a similar number in Europe; these are typically in industrial and domestic situations. For example, in the UK alone: 50 people die, 200 people are hospitalised and 4,000 admitted to Accident & Emergency units annually, due to CO poisoning[1]. When inhaled CO is absorbed easily into the bloodstream where it attaches itself to haemoglobin with an affinity over 200 times that of Oxygen. This has a direct affect on the performance of those parts of our physiology that rely on Oxygen for proper functioning. In this respect, the symptoms are very similar to Hypoxia. CO also reacts, chemically, with other proteins and enzymes in the blood which can lead to damage to the brain, heart and nervous system. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) defines two limits for unhealthy CO exposure: an upper limit of 100 parts per million (ppm) in unventilated spaces; and, an average exposure over 8 hours of 55 ppm. Most healthy people will have existing levels of CO in their blood between 0 and 10 ppm; this can vary greatly depending on exposure to (for example) inner city road traffic and poorly maintained domestic appliances. Smokers will have raised CO levels of between 20 and 40 ppm. Therefore, exposure to relatively small amounts of CO, for many, can increase health risks.
