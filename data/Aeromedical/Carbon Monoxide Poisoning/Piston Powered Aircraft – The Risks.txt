Piston powered aircraft produce high concentrations of CO and, by design, carry the highest risk that CO can enter the cabin during flight. Because many of these aircraft are flown solo, the impact from CO ingress can be the most severe. Typically most piston powered aircraft obtain their cabin heating by directing fresh (ram) air over the engine muffler (silencer). If there are any cracks, holes or poorly fitting components in the exhaust system, then CO-rich exhaust gases can enter the cabin. Engine exhaust may also enter the cabin through inadequately sealed firewalls and wheel wells etc. Valid evidence exists from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that CO poisoning is a risk to flight crew and passengers of piston powered aircraft. First there are numerous accident reports, both fatal and non-fatal, including: March 1983: Piper PA-22-150 N1841P (4 Non-fatal). February 1984: Beech Musketeer N6141N (3 Fatal). November 1988: Cessna 185 N20752 (1 Non-fatal). July 1990: Olsen Pursuit N23GG (2 Fatal). August 1990: Cessna 150 N741MF (2 Fatal). July 1991: Champion 7AC N3006E (2 Fatal). October 1992: Cessna 150 N6402S (1 Non-fatal). April 1994: Cessna 182 N9124G (1 Non-fatal). October 1994: Cessna 150 N7XC (1 Non-fatal). March 1996: Piper Cherokee 140 N95394 (2 Non-fatal). August 1996: Mankovich Revenge N7037J (1 Fatal). December 1997: Piper Comanche 400 N8452P (1 Non-fatal). Secondly, analysis of toxicology samples from fatal U.S. aircraft accidents between 1967 and 1993 showed that at least 360 victims had been exposed to sufficient carbon monoxide before or after the crash to impair their abilities[2]. Note that some CO poisoning occurred post crash (probably due to fire) and that CO poisoning in these cases could not be claimed as the cause of the accident. It is possible that flight crew and passengers on piston powered aircraft have been exposed to low concentrations of CO, and deduced that their symptoms were due to airsickness, fatigue, hypoxia etc. Because, no incapacitation occurred and the symptoms alleviated after removal from exposure, then these incidents have never been reported.
