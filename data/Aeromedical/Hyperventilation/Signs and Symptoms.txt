Hyperventilation can lead to a wide-range of symptoms that will degrade physical and mental performance; in extreme cases it can result in unconsciousness. It is therefore important for pilots to be familiar with the signs and symptoms of Hyperventilation in others and in themselves. It is worth noting that as well as “overt” onset of hyperventilation, like you might witness when someone becomes extremely nervous before an exam or test, it can also be induced “covertly”. If respiration is only increased slightly (e.g. 20%) for a prolonged period, then this can also cause Hyperventilation. Initially you may notice a feeling of dizziness, a coldness and tingling around the lips and a feeling as though there was a band around the head. You may feel nauseous. Peripherally there is vasodilatation and stimulation of sensory nerves causing a sensation of pins and needles in the hands and in the feet. The symptoms associated with Hyperventilation include: Paraesthesia (“pins and needles” - tickling, tingling, burning, pricking, or numbness) especially in the extremities.. Increased heart rate. Headache. Nausea. Blurred vision. Impaired judgment. Memory impairment. Muscle spasms and tics. Muscle weakness. Drowsiness. Unconsciousness. In prolonged cases of Hyperventilation, the muscle spasms can develop into severe and painful contractions of the hands, fingers, feet and toes (carpopedal spasms). If unconsciousness occurs then these spasms may turn into fixed contractions, including the limbs (tetany). Most of these symptoms will be visible, or detectable, in others.
