Despite anecdotal “evidence” about the aircraft cabin environment increasing one’s chances of catching a cold (or other infections) there is still no clear evidence that it does. Whilst air travel (or any other form of travel) may increase the risk due to numbers of people being in close proximity, evidence suggests that cabin air quality does not[4]. The filtered air in today’s aircraft is of very high quality. 99.9% of bacteria and viruses are filtered out and the air is completely exchanged at least 20 times per hour.
