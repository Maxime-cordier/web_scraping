The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, which can sometimes lead to infections of the lungs, especially in young children. Over 200 types of different viruses have been identified as causing the common cold, however, the causes of 20% to 30% of adult colds have not been identified, although these too are considered to be viral[1]. Frequently there is more than one virus present in an infection. Adults typically contract 2 to 3 colds annually (children up to 6), and the infection can last for 2 weeks, although most people feel recovered in much less time.
