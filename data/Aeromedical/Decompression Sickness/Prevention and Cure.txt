To prevent decompression sickness it is required that crew members (recommended for passengers[3]) cease SCUBA diving at a definite time period before a planned flight. Times vary depending on the depth of dive, time of dive and number of dives; crew members should consult their own company rules and national regulations. Typically a single dive not below 10m will require a 24 hour break for crew members, and multiple dives, or single dives below 10m may require a break of 48 hours. Rapid descent, following an aircraft decompression, to an altitude below 18,000ft, should prevent decompression sickness. In effect this is similar to placing a diver into a barometric chamber and increasing the external pressure; it reduces the internal-to-external pressure gradient and returns gaseous Nitrogen back into solution.
