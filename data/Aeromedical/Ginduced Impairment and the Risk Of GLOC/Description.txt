When executing rapid flight control inputs to effect changes in the trajectory of an aircraft certified for aerobatic manoeuvres, the pilot may be vulnerable to G-induced impairment which can culminate in G-induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The effects are a result of the inertial forces created during such manoeuvres and the vulnerability to their physiological consequences which has been shown to vary widely amongst individuals.
