Whilst positive or negative acceleration in all three axes of the human body can produce acceleration against gravity, the G-force which of is of the most potential concern in respect of aircraft control, and which is the concern of this article, is the gravitational force which occurs along the vertical or ‘z’ axis of the body in the positive (head to foot) direction. Such acceleration is referred to as +Gz to distinguish it from acceleration in the opposite negative direction (-Gz) and from lateral (shoulder to shoulder) acceleration (Gy) and fore-aft (front to back or back to front) acceleration (Gx). This article specifically considers only the risk of G-induced impairment which might arise from Gz acceleration whilst flying propeller-driven light aircraft and all further reference to ‘G’ can be read as a reference to Gz. Emphasis will be on explaining the potential danger of exposure to +Gz rather than to -Gz, since the effects of the latter cause early and obvious discomfort to pilots which is invariably sufficient to effectively limit any higher and consequently hazardous levels of exposure. Whilst it is perfectly possible to encounter symptoms of G-induced impairment at even relatively low multiples - say 3G - if they are sustained for more than a few seconds, particular attention will be focussed on excursions to higher G multiples sustained more than very briefly where G-LOC with no perceptible visual warning signs can occur, since awareness of this possibility is not prominent in much of the widely available comment and advice on this subject. Finally, the slightly different physiological effects of being close to loss of consciousness (A-LOC - ‘Almost Loss of Consciousness’) will also be considered on the same basis.
