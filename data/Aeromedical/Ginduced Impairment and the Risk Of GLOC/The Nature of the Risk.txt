Absence of visually-discernable warning signs prior to G-LOC arises when the rapid onset of a high level of positive G is followed by continued flight at a sustained and still relatively high G level rather than an equally repaid return to much lower levels. In this context, “high” means - for an average pilot - somewhere in the vicinity of +6 and ‘continued flight at a high level’ means - again for an average pilot, more than +6 for more than about 4 seconds, since the latter is the time which eyes and brain can function normally using their store of oxygen without receiving a fresh supply of blood. This is illustrated in the diagram below.
