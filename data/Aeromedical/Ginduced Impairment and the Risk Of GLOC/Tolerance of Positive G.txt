Whether or not visual cues of imminent G-LOC are encountered, the vulnerability of individual pilots to it varies. Since few civil pilots are likely to have access to a centrifuge to establish experimentally what their own limits are when the demonstrated effects of variable tolerance are taken into account, the reality for an individual pilot is that G-induced impairment can occur at much lower than the average figures for the triggering rate of high G onset and length of time for which high G is then maintained. It is known that additional danger may exist where a manoeuvre which involves even modest negative G is flown immediately before one in which a high rate of onset of positive G can be expected. Also, tolerance is influenced not only by the inherent susceptibility of an individual pilot but by day-to-day changes in their general physical state caused by factors such as their level of tiredness, any use of even simple medication, the after effects of previous alcohol consumption, a low blood-sugar level, self-imposed or environmental stress, dehydration or demanding physical activity undertaken prior to flight. The extent to which the ‘normal’ G tolerance of a particular pilot can be modified by different training and fitness levels is still poorly understood in a civil context although it is considered highly probable that the range of tolerance amongst civilian aerobatic pilots is greater than that likely to be found in professional military fast jet pilots.
