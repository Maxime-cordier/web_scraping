Employers: Ensure that work schedules, including consecutive shift-working patterns, are constructed so as to have the least possible impact on off duty - and, if applicable, on duty rest.. Seek to provide optimum working conditions;. Use Crew Resource Management (CRM) or Team Resource Management (TRM) training to promote awareness to fatigue and sleep issues.. Establish a Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS), either as a part of the Safety Management System (SMS) or as a standalone system. An effective FRMS is data-driven and routinely collects and analyzes information and reports related to crew alertness as well as operational flight performance data. Computer models can be used to predict average performance capability from sleep/wake history and normal circadian rhythms.. Pilots and ATCOs Adopt personal strategies which are likely to decrease the effects of fatigue such as the following: Planning activities, meals, rest and sleep patterns during off-duty periods;. Making the most of permitted rest breaks, including naps;. Advising colleagues if one detects feeling drowsy;. Alerting colleagues if they appear to be becoming drowsy..
