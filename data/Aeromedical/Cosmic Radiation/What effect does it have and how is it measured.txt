Any ionising radiation can displace charged particles, which means that molecules within the cell walls of living organisms can be disrupted. Whilst processes within cells can repair most of this damage, there is, despite a lot of research in the area, considerable uncertainty as to the potential effects to aircrew of exposure to cosmic radiation and it is presently believed that only long term epidemiological studies of their health will better inform our knowledge as to both the degree of risk and the nature of it. Whilst ionising radiation can be objectively measured by absorbed dose - the energy deposited per unit mass - equal absorbed doses of different types of radiation cause biological effects of different magnitudes and the sensitivity of different body tissues to these different types varies. The risk from human exposure to environmental ionising radiation of any type is therefore estimated by calculating an "effective radiation dose" measured in sieverts (Sv). At the quantities involved these are measured in the smaller units of micro sieverts (μSv) and milli sieverts (mSv) with 1000μSv equal to 1 mSv. Effective dose measurement uses weighting factors to takes into account the variation in tissue sensitivity and known biological effects. Cosmic Radiation is quite different in its composition compared to other forms of ionising radiation to which humans are exposed. Neutrons typically contribute up to 50% of the effective radiation dose that aircrew receive as a result of flying whereas occupational exposures of affected ground level workers are more likely to be dominated by gamma radiation and X-rays. The World Health Organisation notes that the biological effects of heightened exposure to ionising radiation attributable to neutrons are not fully understood. Present thinking is based upon the premise that as well as high levels of radiation being harmful, lower levels carry a risk which is proportional to dose.
