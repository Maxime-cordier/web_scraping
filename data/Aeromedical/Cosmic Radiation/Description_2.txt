protons (15%), photons (5%), and muons (5%). By comparison, at sea level at the same latitudes, the particles present are nearly all muons. This difference from the "outer space" balance of particles is a result of both the proton deflection and the fact that the majority of Secondary Particles released when Primary Particles collide with atoms of hydrogen and helium in the upper atmosphere are neutrons.
