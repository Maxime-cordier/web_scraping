According to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), "A Contracting State, having issued pilot licences, shall not permit the holders thereof to act as pilot of an aircraft engaged in international commercial air transport operations if the licence holders have attained their 60th birthday or, in the case of operations with more than one pilot, their 65th birthday". However, as is often the case with ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS), not all National Aviation Authorities (NAA) interpret or apply the ICAO SARP in the same manor. As examples, some countries do not legislate a maximum age at all whilst others might limit pilot age for flight operations under certain regulations, such as air transport operations, but not limit the age for operations under other rules.
