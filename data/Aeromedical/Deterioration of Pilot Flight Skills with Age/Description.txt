Age, as it relates to pilots, is an interesting and often contentious, issue. Pilots are subject to all of the age related problems that afflict the general population. With age, bones tend to shrink in size and density thus weakening them and making them more susceptible to fracture. Muscles generally lose strength and flexibility, and coordination or balance may be affected. The heart rate normally becomes slightly slower and the heart might become bigger. Blood vessels and arteries become stiffer which means that the heart must work harder to pump blood through them. This can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension) and other cardiovascular problems. Digestive and urinary problems become more common. Memory may become less efficient with age. It might take longer to learn new things or to remember familiar words or names. Eyesight and hearing acuity often diminish. Routine medical checks for pilots are legislated to become more frequent after age 60. These help to maintain an acceptable level of safety by confirming that the normal effects of aging have not compromised the required medical standards. However, the routine assessment of flight skills and the affect of aging on those skills is not so closely monitored in a significant portion of the pilot population. Whilst pilots employed in airline operations are, in general, subject to simulator checks every six months, those working in other facets of the industry, such as corporate or private jet, might only require a proficiency check on an annual basis and, under the legislation of some countries, the interval can be extended to two years between check rides. In some jurisdictions, the requirement for a check ride can be dropped completely if appropriate "training in lieu" is conducted. Pilots holding a PPL (Private Pilots Licence) and flying light aircraft are not subject to periodic check flights in most parts of the world.
