The carotid sinus is a collection of sensors in the carotid artery. It helps to regulate the flow of blood through the main artery in the neck, called the carotid artery, and into the brain. Some people can develop a hypersensitive carotid sinus. This means that any physical stimulation of the carotid sinus can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, resulting in fainting. This condition is known as carotid sinus syndrome. Examples of physical stimulation that may affect the carotid sinus include: • turning the head to one side • wearing a tight collar • shaving over the part of the neck that contains the carotid sinus Carotid sinus syndrome is very rare in people who are under 40 years of age. It is most common among older men.
