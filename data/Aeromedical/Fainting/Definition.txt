Fainting, or syncope, is a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness. Healthcare professionals often use the term ‘syncope’ when referring to fainting because it distinguishes fainting from other causes of temporary unconsciousness, such as seizures (fits) or concussion. In most cases of fainting, the person who has fainted regains consciousness within a minute or two. However, less common types of fainting can be medical emergencies. If a person who has fainted does not regain consciousness within two minutes, then medical assistance should be sought immediately and the patient placed in the Recovery Position.
