Vasavagal syncope is a form of fainting related to the temporary malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates heart rate and blood pressure, in response to a trigger, such as the sight of blood or extreme emotional distress. When heart rate slows, blood pressure drops, and the resulting lack of blood to the brain causes fainting and confusion. Fainting may be preceded by feeling unwell, nauseous, and confusion. Vasovagal syncope is usually harmless and requires not treatment, but a person may injure themselve during an episode.
