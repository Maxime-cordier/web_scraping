A circadian rhythm is any biological process involving a built-in, self-sustained, oscillation during periods of about 24 hours, which are created by Earth's rotation. These 24-hour rhythms have been widely observed in plants, animals, fungi and cyanobacteria. The rhythms are adjusted (entrained) to the local environment by external cues, which include light intensity, temperature, humidity and redox cycles.
