Serious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. This can be indicated through wheezing and a blue tinge to the skin caused by lack of oxygen. Poor blood circulation leads to a weak pulse, pale skin, and fainting. When symptoms include impaired breathing and affect circulation, the person is said to be in "anaphylactic shock". Anaphylaxis occurs because no nutrients are circulated throughout the body, causing the widening of blood vessels (Vasodilation). This vasodilation causes blood pressure to decrease, which leads to the loss of consciousness. Those with asthma or an allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, or seafood are at greater risk of anaphylaxis. Note that an anaphylactic shock can also be triggered by venom from insect bites or stings (especially bee and wasp stings) and as a reaction to medication (including certain anti-biotics, aspirin, and morphine.
