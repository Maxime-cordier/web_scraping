Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a common medication used to treat allergic reactions. Epinephrine reverses the allergic reaction by improving blood circulation. This is done by tightening blood vessels in order to increase the heart beat and circulation to bodily organs. People diagnosed with a food allergy may carry an injectable form of epinephrine such as an EpiPen (portable epinephrine-dispensing devices), or wear some form of medical alert jewelry, or develop an emergency action plan, in accordance with their doctor. The affected individual may recognise the onset of anaphylaxis and be able to brief other crew members on the correct response. They may administer the EpiPen themselves or they may need help from another crew member. It is possible that a second dose of epinephrine may be required for severe reactions.
