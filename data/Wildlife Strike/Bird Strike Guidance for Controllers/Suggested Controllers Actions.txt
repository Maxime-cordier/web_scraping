Best practice embedded in the ASSIST principle could be followed: (A - Acknowledge; S - Separate, S - Silence; I - Inform, S - Support, T - Time) A - acknowledge the bird strike, ask for the crew’s intentions when the situation permits, minimise frequency changes, and establish whether the crew is able to control the aircraft; S - separate the aircraft from other traffic, prioritise it for landing (allow long final if requested), keep the active runway clear of departures, arrivals and vehicles; S - silence the non-urgent calls (as required) and use separate frequency where possible; I - inform the airport emergency services and all concerned parties according to local procedures; S - support the flight experiencing the consequences of the bird strike with any information requested and deemed necessary (e.g. type of approach, runway length and aerodrome details, etc.); T - provide time for the crew to assess the situation, don’t press with non urgent matters. In case of a bird strike occurring on take-off or landing, the runway must be checked to ensure it is clean from any debris and/or bird remains. Bird remains should be kept to assist any subsequent investigation and, if necessary, passed to an appropriate authority for identification.
