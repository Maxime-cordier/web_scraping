Although radar has been used for large area tracking of migrating birds for many years, the requirements of small-area bird detection, at a scale suitable for airport hazard assessment and management, has been a relatively recent development. Relatively inexpensive X-band and S-band marine radar transceivers have been developed specifically to track birds. With radar scanning rates typically of 24 rpm - once every 2.5 seconds, it is now feasible to use it for both the capture of data on significant bird activity for planning and strategic management purposes and for the real-time tactical monitoring of such activity. Whilst obviously still expensive, where the degree of bird hazard is high, radar provides an option which should be seriously considered. Significant numbers of system deployments have now occurred although they are still mainly in the USA. Installations include civil applications at New York/John F Kennedy International Airport, Chicago/O'Hare International Airport and Seattle-Tacoma although the majority of both deployment and development activity is still focussed on military air movements.
