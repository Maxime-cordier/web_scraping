One of the reasons why ICAO requires that all bird strikes are reported, whether or not they cause damage to the aircraft and whatever bird/wildlife species was involved, is that experience of the analysis of bird remains collected after strikes by experts has shown that the species reported as involved are frequently incorrect. Incidents where a bird strike was narrowly avoided, perhaps by flight crew being forced to take evasive action to keep away from birds, or of observed significant bird activity which might have constituted a direct hazard in slightly different circumstances, should be reported on a standard safety reporting form. The information that is commonly sought in a bird strike report includes: General information (flight number or registration, aircraft and engine type). Location and time, (geographic location or airport/runway used, time, IAS and height (AGL) during the occurrence, light conditions - day , night, twilight). Flight parameters - Altitude or height agl; IAS. Phase of flight (take-off roll, initial climb, climb, cruise, descent, approach, landing roll). Part(s) of aircraft struck and (if) damaged (engine number, radome, windshield, landing gear, fuselage, tail, etc). Effects on flight (rejected take off, emergency/precautionary landing, engine(s) shut down and other consequent effects). Relevant meteorological conditions (visibility, cloud cover, precipitation). Species information (exact species or species group if known). Number of birds seen and number struck. Size of birds - small, medium and large if not identified to species or species group). Prior warning of bird activity by RTF/ATIS/NOTAM/BIRDTAM. Any other relevant information and remarks regarding the occurrence.
