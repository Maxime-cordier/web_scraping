Meaningful learning methods can motivate students to learn. However, motivation is not always straightforward and is influenced by what else a learner needs at that time. This 'needs' concept was famously developed by Abraham Maslow (1943) known as the 'Hierarchy of Needs', which still holds true today. It explains the importance of satisfying human needs before being motivated to do something. These needs go from basic, such as thirst and sleep, to more sophisticated, such as confidence and self-actualisation. If a student is tired they are less able to focus on learning to remember, as they are distracted by the lack of a need i.e. sleep in this case. The more needs that are met the more likely a student is motivated to learn. The same applies to memory retrieval, so if a pilot is fatigued they may not be able to recall an action as easily, which can potentially have significant ramifications. Emotion also plays a key role when learning to remember. A student would feel encouraged to learn if the topic and presentation of the content is relevant to them so they can relate. A person looks to make emotional connections between concepts where they attach their own feeling to create meaning. This highlights the need for visuals within training, as design visionary, Don Norman (2003), put it "attractive things work better", because it engages people at the emotional level. Evoking emotion helps with learning, but a person's emotion can also interfere with the retrieval of information, as it can lock the memory. Flight crew could experience a memory block during an emergency, which is an emotionally stressful event. This makes engaging training and thorough learning all the more important.
