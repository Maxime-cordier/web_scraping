Pilots need to learn throughout their professional careers, but learning to remember is quite a complex process. Each procedure that a pilot needs to learn goes through a multi-step memory system. At each step the brain decides whether to take information further or to delete it, which is dependent on the content quality, presentation, and a personâ€™s receptiveness at that moment. When information reaches the final step it can be stored and used in practice to enable pilots to act safely whatever the situation may bring.
