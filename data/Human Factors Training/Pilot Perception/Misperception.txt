Everything that passes through the senses is not necessarily “perceived”. We tend to perceive things that: we are interested in (and therefore looking for, or sensitive to),. make a large impact on our senses (bright lights, loud noises, irregular movement), and. signs of potential danger; things that trigger fear.. On the contrary we tend to perceive fewer things that do not interest us, are not making a large impact, and do not induce fear. Also, we do not always perceive accurately the things that we focus on and think about. This occurs in two distinct ways: Due to limitations in the performance of our sense organs and the manner in which our brains re-construct sense data, our perception can be fooled into a false picture of the outside world, but one that we see, believe and literally “feel” to be accurate.. Because we carry with us assumptions (including what we believe to be facts), past experiences, biases, pre-conceived ideas and prejudices, then we are prone to apply deletions, distortions and generalisations to what we observe. That is, we are often subjective and not objective.. As humans, we are all susceptible to the misperceptions caused by limitations in our senses, and we will generally experience the misperceptions in an identical manner. However, as individuals, with different experiences and personalities, the results and impact of our subjectivity will differ – sometimes quite markedly. In both cases other factors can influence our susceptibility to misperception, such as: illness, stress, fatigue, medication (and other drugs), concentration, motivation, etc.
