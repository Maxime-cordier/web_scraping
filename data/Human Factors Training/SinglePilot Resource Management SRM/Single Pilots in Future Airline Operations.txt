In roughly the same time frame that SRM–ADM training has been advocated to improve risk mitigation for single-pilot GA flights, proposals to scale down airline crewing requirements for large commercial transport jets have multiplied and faced intense objections from airline pilot organisations and other stakeholders. A 2019 report from the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) — ALPA White Paper: The Dangers of Single-Pilot Operations — said, “The current body of evidence and experience, including more than a decade of study by the [U.S.] National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the [U.S.] Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), shows that the safety risks and challenges associated with [air carrier] single-pilot operations far outweigh its potential benefits.” Much of the ALPA risk assessment is associated with the increased workload for a single pilot, the elimination of “a critical layer of monitoring and operating redundancy in the cockpit” and the “inability of a single pilot to handle many emergency situations.”
