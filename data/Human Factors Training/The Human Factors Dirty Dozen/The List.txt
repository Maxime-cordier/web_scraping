The original list, developed for aircraft maintenance, is available in many documents, one good example is TC14175[3], and this list is used as the basis for this entry. There is no order of priority. The Dirty Dozen is also used to refer to a poster campaign, developed by the Maintenance And Ramp Safety Society (MARSS) in support of the original Transport Canada training programme. Each poster illustrates a different human factor.
