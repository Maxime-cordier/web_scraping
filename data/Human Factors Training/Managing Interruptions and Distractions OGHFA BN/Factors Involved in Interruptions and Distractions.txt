Interruptions and distractions in the cockpit may be subtle and momentary or intrusive, obvious and continuing, but all can be disruptive to the flight crew. A study by the NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS)) in 1998 indicated that there are four primary factors that generate interruptions or distractions: Communications receiving the final weights while taxiing a flight attendant entering the cockpit calls from ATC or on company radio. receiving the final weights while taxiing. a flight attendant entering the cockpit. calls from ATC or on company radio.

Searching for traffic after a Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS)/ACAS alert.. Over time, the ASRS database has been used to estimate the respective contributions of these four sources to interruptions and distractions. These estimates are shown in Table 2. Sources: NASA - ASRS The four factors shown in Table 2 are behaviours of the flightcrew. A variety of other contributing factors can make these and other flight events more likely to result in interruptions and distractions. These include: Poor flight-deck ergonomics. High flight-deck noise levels. Inadequate language proficiency (pilots and controllers). Poor airport infrastructure (e.g., unclear markings). Flight crew fatigue.. It is also important to note that interruptions and distractions need not be large or of long duration to result in a safety problem. Even minor disruptions (e.g., a non-threatening equipment malfunction) can turn a routine flight into a challenging event, particularly for a crew at the end of a long, tiring day of flying.
