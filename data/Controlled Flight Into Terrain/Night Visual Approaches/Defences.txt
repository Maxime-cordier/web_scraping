Unless the pilot is intimately familiar with the airfield, thorough pre-approach study and preparation is required. The list of potential questions is almost endless but the pilot must concern himself with the following issues before commencing the approach: What is the terrain like approaching and surrounding the airfield?. Is there a published circuit altitude and is that above or below the minimum circuit height dictated by the Company Ops Manual?. When can I safely begin a descent to circuit altitude based on any terrain or obstruction issues in the area surrounding the airport?. When joining the circuit, are there any published limitations to circuit direction (i.e., RH circuits only to runway XX)?. Is there a published maximum distance that I can extend my downwind leg before turning towards the runway (i.e., terrain penetrates a 3 degree glideslope 6nm from the threshold of runway YY)?. What runway lighting is available (is it ground or pilot controlled)?. Are there approach lights?. Is there visual approach path guidance (PAPI or VASIS)?. Is the runway standard width or is it wider/narrower than what I am used to?. Is the runway level or is there a slope?. If the runway is not level, is it up sloping or down sloping?. Are there navigation aids (such as DME) that I can use to help determine the position the aircraft?.
