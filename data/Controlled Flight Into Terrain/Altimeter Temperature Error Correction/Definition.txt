Altimeter Temperature Error Correction is applied to altimeters to compensate for error caused by deviation from ISA conditions. Current generation FMS units that support Vertical Navigation and provide for all axis global navigation system approaches also compensate for temperature. Pilots should confirm that this is the case on their aircraft and know when corrections are not required. If in doubt, apply corrections for low temperature.
