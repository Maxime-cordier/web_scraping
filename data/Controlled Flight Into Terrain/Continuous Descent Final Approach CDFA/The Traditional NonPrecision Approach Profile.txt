Figure 1 illustrates the flight path of a typical NPA procedure flown using the "traditional" "dive and drive" technique. The path of the aircraft is coloured red. The aircraft approaches the final approach fix (FAF) at the cleared height, then descends until reaching the minimum descent height (MDH). This height is then maintained until either the runway is in sight or the missed approach point is reached. If the runway is not sighted by the missed approach point, a go-around must be flown. The descent to the MDH may be undertaken at any convenient rate of descent; however, best practices would have the aircraft arrive at the MDH at a distance from the runway equivalent to the required visibility that is published for the approach. More complicated NPA procedures might include check heights or any number of step down fixes at various points during the approach.
