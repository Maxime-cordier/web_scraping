A pilot is cleared for an approach at night to an airport with which they are not familiar, but decides to fly by visual reference instead of following the vertical profile of the assigned instrument procedure because they can see the runway in the distance; CFIT results (e.g. S76, Peasmarsh East Sussex UK, 2012).. The pilot is unaware of the existence of an airspace reservation and enters it without clearance resulting in Loss of Separation from another aircraft (e.g. AT72 / B732, vicinity Queenstown New Zealand, 1999, B738 / C172, en route, near Falsterbo Sweden, 2014).. The pilot copies a clearance incorrectly but fails to read it back; the read-back omission is overlooked by the ATCO and the aircraft climbs to a level to which it has not been cleared creating a level bust (e.g. C525 / B773, vicinity London City UK, 2009).. The pilot focuses on a certain aspect of the flight and ignores others thus allowing the development of a hazardous situation (e.g. B738, Rostov-on-Don Russia, 2016). The ATCO forgets the presence of an aircraft on approach and clears another aircraft to enter the active runway in its path resulting in a Runway Incursion (e.g. B738 / B744, Los Angeles USA, 2004, B738/B734, Johannesburg South Africa, 2010).. The ATCO issues a clearance to an aircraft flying in IMC which results in it entering a cumulonimbus cloud, where severe icing and turbulence are encountered.. The ATCO clears an aircraft to a level where it will be in conflict with a second locally-based aircraft; the aircraft is unaware of the error because communications with the locally-based aircraft are being conducted in the local language whereas other aircraft communications are being carried out in English (e.g. GLEX/F2TH, vicinity Ibiza Spain, 2012)..
