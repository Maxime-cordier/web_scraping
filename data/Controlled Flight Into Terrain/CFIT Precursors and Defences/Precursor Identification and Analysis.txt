The traditional role of accident prevention has been to analyse accidents and serious incidents in order to determine their causal factors, and then to create defences with the aim of preventing recurrence. This fundamentally reactive approach takes no account of lesser events that have not – so far – had serious consequences. Modern accident prevention strategies also take into account the circumstances which gave rise to these lesser events if it appears that a more severe outcome could have followed in only slightly different circumstances. This process is able to increase the body of precursors - events or factors - which can inform better accident prevention. The process of identifying precursors should make use of safety data from any available safety reporting or monitoring scheme, such as: Feedback from training (especially simulator) sessions;. Pilots’ reports;. Flight data analysis;. Line observations (e.g. Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA);. Survey and audit reports; as well as,. Accident and incident investigation.. Clearly, the sharing of lessons learned between operators, manufacturers and others is also important. This was the driving force behind the Global Aviation Safety Network (GAIN) initiative. Although this project has not been active for ten years or more, Reports of the various GAIN working groups are available at GAIN's webpage and some contain still-relevant content. The IATA Safety Trend Evaluation, Analysis & Data Exchange System (STEADES), which has the world's largest database of de-identified narrative safety reports, provides its members (and others on payment of fees) with a means to access analysis based on this database. Such analyses can help various stakeholders in aviation safety develop safety management strategies.
