The alerting performance of MSAW is generally dependent on three key elements: An accurate terrain definition. An appropriate ‘look-ahead time’ setting. Inhibition of certain types of aircraft (e.g. those intentionally remaining close to the ground). If these three elements are appropriately defined, then it should be expected that the air traffic controller would be able to rely on MSAW during the provision of service. Any one of the above elements being insufficiently optimised will very likely result in either too many unnecessary alerts or, if too short a look ahead time in set, insufficient time for the air traffic controller to respond effectively to an MSAW alert.
