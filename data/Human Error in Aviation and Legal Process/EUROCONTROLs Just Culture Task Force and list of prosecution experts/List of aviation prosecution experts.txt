EUROCONTROL in cooperation with IFATCA and the ECA supports its Member States and their judiciaries in finding aviation safety experts trained in Just Culture principles to assist national prosecutors entrusted with the judicial review of aviation incidents and accidents. Experts can be requested to help prosecutors understand the details of aviation occurrences so prosecutors can make an informed decision whether a judicial investigation or criminal prosecution is necessary or not. When requested by a judicial authority of a EUROCONTROL Member State, EUROCONTROL will be able to make a recommendation on a suitable expert. It remains the decision and choice of any prosecutor to avail themselves of an expert from the list, thus leaving them the freedom of action in full respect of the independence of the justice system. The Just Culture experts on the list are air traffic controllers or pilots who have been through advanced training and confirmed as prosecution experts based on criteria established by the Just Culture Task Force, IFATCA and ECA. Anyone who would like to seek EUROCONTROLâ€™s support in finding aviation safety experts trained in Just Culture principles, could fill-in and send a request on the dedicated EUROCONTROL webpage.
