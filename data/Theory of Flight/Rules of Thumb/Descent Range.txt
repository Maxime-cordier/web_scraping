Different types will have different performance so pilots must establish and check any ‘rule’ for their own aircraft. 30 per 10 plus 10… For many older jet transports, a normal descent from cruise altitude descent required about 30 nm for each 10,000ft of height loss and a further 10 nm to slow down. Therefore: 30,000’ cruise = (3 x 30) + 10 = 100 nm descent 35,000’ cruise = (3.5 x 30) + 10 = 115 nm descent Although not strictly accurate, it provided a good first guesstimate. Modern, more efficient aircraft, will need greater distances but similar rules of thumb can often be defined from a review of performance figures and line experience. You may find that (e.g.) “40 per 10 plus 15” works better for your type. The important point here is that well practiced rules of thumb may need to be revised dramatically when changing from one type to another. Similarly, to confirm that a descent profile is going well: 30 out at 10 and 250…. Thirty miles from the airport at 10,000' and 250 knots. If at 30 nm from destination, the aircraft is still above either 10,000’ or 250 kt (or both!) getting down and reducing speed to achieve a stabilized approach will be a real challenge in many jet transports.
