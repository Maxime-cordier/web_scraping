Useful for evaluating runway crosswind from reported wind, the crosswind is a function of the SINE of the angle between the runway and the wind direction. Therefore, crosswind can be estimated as follows: and runway (degrees) (% of wind strength) wind direction and runway in degrees The analogue clock face provides an easy way to remember this: 15 min = ¼ of an hour 15 degrees off = ¼ of the total wind across 30 min = ½ of an hour 30 degrees off = ½ of the total wind across 60 min = A full hour 60 degrees off = All of the wind across A similar process can be used to estimate wind effect on groundspeed Combining Max drift and Crosswind component: Flying at 420 kt groundspeed (7 nm/min) in the vicinity of a 60 kt wind (approx. 8½ degrees max drift) headwind from 30 degrees off track, the expected drift angle is just over 4 degrees. Flying at 420 kt airspeed in the vicinity of a 60 kt wind from 30 degrees off track, groundspeed will be approximately 360 kt (~6 nm/min) so max drift is 10 degrees and the expected drift angle will be 5 degrees.
