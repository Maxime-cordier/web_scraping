3 degree glideslope = 300’/nm to touchdown Again from the 1 in 60 rule, 3 degrees at 60 nm ~ 3 nm ~ 18,000’ so 3 degrees at 6 nm ~ 1,800’ and 3 degrees at 1 nm ~ 300’) This is not exact – and approach plates will show precise figures for any approach - but it provides a simple way to spot any gross errors.
