The Servo Transparency phenomenon, also known as Servo Reversibility or Jack Stall, can be encountered during abrupt manoeuvring of any single hydraulic system equipped helicopter, particularly at high speeds. The phenomenon marks a flight envelope boundary. This aircraft phenomenon occurs smoothly and is not dangerous if properly anticipated by a pilot during an abrupt or excessive high load manoeuvre such as a high positive g turn or pull-up. The factors that affect Servo Transparency are airspeed, collective pitch input, gross weight, "G" loads and density altitude.
