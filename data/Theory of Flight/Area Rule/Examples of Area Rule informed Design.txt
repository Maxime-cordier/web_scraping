Originally, the shaping of the Boeing 747's upper deck "hump" was designed to be as small as possible given normal streamlining principles. It was later realised that the drag could be reduced much more by lengthening the hump, using it to reduce wave drag offsetting the tail surface's contribution. The new design was introduced on the 747-300, improving its cruise speed and lowering drag, with the side effect of slightly increasing capacity on passenger flights. The AIRBUS A-380-800 has several area rule-dictated features - the jet engines in front of (and not directly below) the wings and the shaping at the wing root.
