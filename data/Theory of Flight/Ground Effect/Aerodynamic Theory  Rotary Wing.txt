A similar increase in the lift generated in ground effect, compared to free air, applies to a rotary wing when in the hover for essentially the same reasons identified for the fixed wing case. Proximity to the ground alters the velocity of the downwash so that a reduced angle of attack is required to sustain a hover. This leads to a reduction in induced drag, attributable to the reduced angle of attack, and decreases the power required. In addition to this, rotor blade tip vortices are similarly affected by ground proximity - they are forced outwards so that the outboard portion of the blade functions more efficiently and the turbulence caused by recirculation of the vortices is reduced. As with the fixed wing case, the overall effect of an improved lift/drag ratio when a rotary wing is in ground effect is that a given amount of lift will be produced at a lower angle of attack than would be required in free air.
