From the above discussion, it is apparent that the operational consequences of “hot and high” conditions could result in any or all of the following” Engines are “temperature limited” and maximum thrust/torque/power is not available. Lift generation is reduced. Maximum takeoff weight may be limited. The IAS/TAS relationship will result in higher speeds over the ground in all phases of flight. Due to reduced thrust, lift generation and higher ground speed for a given IAS, takeoff roll will be increased. Rate of climb will be reduced. Radius of turn will increase. Missed approach climb capability will be reduced. Stopping distance will be increased (stopping distance is related to mass x TAS squared). Maximum tyre rotation speed may be compromised on takeoff or on landing.
