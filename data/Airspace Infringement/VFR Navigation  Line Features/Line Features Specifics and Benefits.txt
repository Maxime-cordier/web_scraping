Line features can be very helpful in VFR navigation because: They are easy to spot (unlike point features) and identify. This is especially true when orientation is lost. In many cases the easiest way to re-establish position awareness is spotting a coastline, if one is available.. They are easy to follow (unlike point and area features). Flying along a line feature can often offer high level of position certainty at the price of slight increase of track distance.. The intersection points between two line features can be used as turning points. Also, using such spots is an easy and accurate way to determine oneâ€™s position.. It is usually easier to find unique line features on a map and recognize them from the cockpit. Also, line feature curves offer good precision when determining the aircraft position. By contrast, area features are often too large to offer precise position reading and point features can be ambiguous..
