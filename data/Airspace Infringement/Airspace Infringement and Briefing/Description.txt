Airspace infringement occurs when an aircraft penetrates an area into which special clearance is required without having such clearance. A major cause of airspace infringement is lack of awareness of the presence of the controlled airspace or danger, restricted or prohibited area concerned, or of its significance. This is usually due to poor pre-flight briefing.
