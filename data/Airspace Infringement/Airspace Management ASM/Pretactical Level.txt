The pre-tactical level of ASM involves activities for day-to-day airspace allocation to optimally accommodate the requests of the various airspace users. This is normally done by a joint civil/military airspace management cell (AMC). The degree of discretion and authority of the AMC is determined by the HLAPB at strategic level. The AMC collects the requests for airspace reservation, processes them in accordance with established procedures and priorities and produces the airspace use plan (AUP). The scope of the pre-tactical level is normally from D-6 (i.e. six days before the activities) until D-1 (when the AUP is promulgated). During the period from D-6 to D-2, the available information about the airspace plan is published in the draft AUP. This facilitates coordination in case of conflicting requests so that appropriate solutions could be found in advance. After the AUP is promulgated on D-1, modification of the airspace allocation might be necessary due to e.g. cancellations or new requests. In this case, an updated AUP (UUP) is created and promulgated within the period of validity of the AUP.
