The FUA Concept has been developed at the three Levels of Airspace Management that correspond to Civil/Military co-ordination tasks. Each Airspace Management level has an impact on the others: Level 1 - Strategic - definition of the national airspace policy and establishment of pre-determined airspace structures;. Level 2 - Pre-tactical - day-to-day allocation of airspace according to user requirements;. Level 3 - Tactical - real-time use of airspace allowing safe Operational Air Traffic & General Air Traffic (OAT & GAT) operations..
