Airspace infringement occurs when an aircraft penetrates airspace for which explicit prior clearance is required without having such a clearance. A major cause of airspace infringement is poor navigation, leading to penetration of the controlled airspace or danger, restricted, prohibited, temporary segregated or temporary reserved area concerned. This situation may arise either because the pilots are uncertain of their position or because they are unaware of the designation of the area concerned because of inadequate briefing or their use of out-of-date charts.
