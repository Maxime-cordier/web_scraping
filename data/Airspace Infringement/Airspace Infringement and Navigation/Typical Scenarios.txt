An aircraft operating VFR and approaching controlled airspace with the intention of obtaining crossing clearance mis-identifies a position on the ground due to partial cloud cover and enters the controlled airspace without permission.. A pilot navigating by reference to VOR beacons makes an error in determining his position, alters heading on this basis and enters a Prohibited Area.. A pilot using GPS incorrectly programmes the equipment and follows a track which diverges from the planned route, resulting in violation of a Danger Area.. A pilot using an out of date chart enters the area concerned without awareness because it is not marked on the chart being used..
