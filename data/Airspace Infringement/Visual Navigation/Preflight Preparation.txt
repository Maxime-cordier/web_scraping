As with other modes of navigation, pre-flight preparation is extremely important. After aeronautical information, including NOTAMs, has been checked and a meteorological briefing obtained, the route must be selected and marked on the map, avoiding controlled airspace, danger areas, etc.; or if it is intended to enter controlled airspace for part of the flight, the point of entry and departure must be plotted and defined by reference to a radio beacon or airway reporting point. The route should be selected by reference to a topographical map, so that best use is made of ground features to facilitate navigation; for example, the route might follow a line feature (e.g. a coastline, railway or river) and turn at easily identified positions (e.g. a railway intersection, lake, or prominent town). Ideally, a topographical map marked with airspace restrictions should be used. Care should be taken to ensure that line features and turning points selected are unique. A simple flight plan showing planned levels, mean tracks, distance and time between turning points, and minimum safe altitude should be prepared. Timing marks should be marked along tracks to aid searching for and verification of ground features.
