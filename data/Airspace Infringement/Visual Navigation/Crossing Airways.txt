Plan to enter or cross controlled airspace at a navigation aid or reporting point and make the track cross at right angles so that minimum time is spent in controlled airspace. Calculate the ETA to the edge of controlled airspace accurately, by reference to a really reliable visual fix. Always mark the point where you will turn back if you havenâ€™t got clearance.
