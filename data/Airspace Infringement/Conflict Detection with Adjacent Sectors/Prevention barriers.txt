Prevention barriers are intended to solve the problem before it has emerged. Routine Structured Scan – this is a basic part of the ATC job. It involves repeated checks of the situational display and flight data in order to properly identify a conflict.. System Supported Coordination – system tools that support coordination (e.g. electronic proposals and counter proposals, assistance with aircraft transfer, etc.) can make the process of coordination easier and more standard.. Shared surveillance trajectories – downstream provision of updated trajectory enhances the next sector's situational awareness.. Coordination phraseology and procedures – strict adherence to standard phraseology and procedures reduces the possibility of misunderstanding.. Medium term conflict prediction tools with route updates. Short Term Conflict Probe – this barrier includes various tools to check whether a clearance that is about to be issued will cause a conflict.. Predictive Separation Alert Tool – an update to MTCD and STCA that includes enhancements such as updates in case the flight deviates from the expected trajectory or inclusion of downlinked flight crew intentions.. Compliance monitoring aids – tools monitoring for compliance between planned and executed flight trajectory and providing alerts in case of discrepancy.. More detailed description of the prevention barriers is provided in the Conflict Detection with Adjacent Sectors – Prevention Barriers article.
