In a side by side rotor configuration, two horizontal, counter-rotating rotors are mounted side-by-side on a helicopter (or transverse rotorcraft). The anti-torque effect is provided by the opposing rotation of the two main rotors. The side-by-side configuration is one of the possible flight configurations of a tilt-rotor aircraft, when the rotors are in the vertical position to provide vertical lift.
