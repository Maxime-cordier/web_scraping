British Airways helicopter Sikorsky S-61N, G-ASNL ditched in the North Sea, 75 nm North-east of Aberdeen on 11 March 1983. Source: Wikicommons, Author: Morrispeter Ditching an aircraft into the sea, a river, or a lake, is a manoeuvre that, by definition, cannot be practiced and may be extremely hazardous. It is only contemplated when no other realistic option remains in an emergency or, in the rotary case, imminent emergency situation. For helicopters, ditching may be prompted by a sudden-onset emergency or where continued safe flight to the nearest designated landing location or even the nearest suitable land is not assured; it will often be accompanied by considerable structural conditions outside of the â€œnorm", such as tail rotor failures or very high vibrations. All of these contribute to the already considerable pressure of getting the aircraft down and evacuating it. Even if the Sea State is slight, there is a strong possibility that a helicopter will fail to remain upright and/or will sink rapidly. If the occupants survive the ditching then, even with the benefit of protective clothing and equipment, in cold waters they may succumb to cold shock or hypothermia before they are rescued.
