Although the need for a technical standard to ensure that minimum acceptable levels of performance and health and safety standards were met by EBS systems, progress towards this has been slow. This was partly because EBS were initially seen as a temporary solution pending the development of Emergency Flotation Systems (EFS) which were capable of preventing the capsize which renders EBS necessary. However, when it became apparent that EFS capability was unlikely to be able to meet that target on every occasion, interest in an EBS Technical Standard was revived and a substantive intent to move forward was demonstrated with the publication of CAP 1034, a comprehensive document on the subject, by the UK CAA in May 2013. This intent was further confirmed by the subsequent publication of UK CAA Offshore Helicopter Safety Review in February 2014. The UK CAA document referred to above defines two standards, ‘Category B’ which equates to EBS currently deployed in the UK North Sea sector and a more stringent ‘Category A’ which would meet the requirements for water impact where EBS deployment at very short notice and/or underwater would be required.
