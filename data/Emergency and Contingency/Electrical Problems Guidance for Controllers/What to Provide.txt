Best practice embedded in the ASSIST principle could be followed: (A - Acknowledge; S - Separate, S - Silence; I - Inform, S - Support, T - Time) A - acknowledge the emergency, provide position information and suitable vectors if navigational problems are reported.. S - separate the aircraft as necessary, expect the aircraft to request level change in order to maintain VMC.. S - silence the non-urgent calls (as required) and use separate frequency where possible.. I - inform the airport emergency fire rescue services and all concerned parties according to local procedures; as tower controller expect airport authorities to execute their emergency plan; inform the supervisor and other sectors/units concerned.. S - support the flight by providing any information requested and necessary such as next suitable aerodrome, type of approach, runway length and aerodrome details, etc.. T - provide time for the crew to assess and deal with the emergency, donâ€™t press with non urgent matters.. When informed about possible/actual electrical failure, be ready to: Inform the pilot about nearest suitable aerodrome and provide radar vectors as necessary.. Provide airfield and weather information .. Coordinate and arrange (if applicable) type of approach desired by the crew.. It is important to avoid a go-around because of ATC action, whether by direct or indirect cause.. If practicable keep the flight clear of IMC.. Arrange for Ground Power on arrival (GPU)..
