FLY THE AIRCRAFT. A hydraulic failure may or may not result in loss of some primary or secondary control surfaces. It may also result in the loss of the autopilot. Therefore, it is critical that the pilot flying (PF) maintain focus on the continued safe control of the aircraft. With multiple hydraulic system or component failures, control of the aircraft may be difficult. The extreme, but highly unlikely, case of a total loss of aircraft hydraulics could necessitate the non-standard use of engine thrust to maintain aircraft control (e.g. DC-10, Sioux City, 1989).. Perform Memory Actions. If there are memory drills associated with the failure, they should be completed in a timely fashion. In a multi-crew aircraft, memory items and the follow-on checklists and procedures will be completed by the pilot monitoring (PM) with confirmation of critical actions, when appropriate, from the PF, using challenge and response.. Complete Associated Checklists. Perform QRH, checklist or ECAM procedures as appropriate to the aircraft type..
