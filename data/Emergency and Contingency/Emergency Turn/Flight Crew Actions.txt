In the event of an engine failure after takeoff, crews must be prepared to immediately deviate from any cleared routing that is inconsistent with the Emergency Turn routing while concurrently carrying out the specified engine failure after takeoff (EFATO) drills. Both elements are critical to a successful outcome as the engine out drills ensure aircraft control and optimum climb performance while adherence to the Emergency Turn routing provides for obstacle clearance. Failure to comply with either element could result in disaster. In the event of a deviation from the cleared routing, flight crew should advise ATC of the deviation as soon as practicable incorporating the term “STANDBY” at the end of the message to limit the distraction of subsequent ATC calls until the flight deck situation is under control.
