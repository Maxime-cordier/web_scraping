The attending flight attendant will immediately do a preliminary assessment of the patient. If the patient is conscious, the flight attendant will use a question and answer protocol (with the help of an interpreter if required) to determine why the patient is in distress. If the patient is not conscious, the preliminary accesssment will include the A,B,C's of first aid: Airway (does the patient have an open airway?). Breathing (is the patient breathing). Circulation (is there a detectable heartbeat). If the answer to any of these questions is no, appropriate first aid techniques inclusive of artificial respiration or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), will be initiated.
