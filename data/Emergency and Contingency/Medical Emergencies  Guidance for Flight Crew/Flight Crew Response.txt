Flight crew response to an on board medical emergency will depend on the nature of the problem, the degree of urgency for medical intervention and the location and phase of flight in which the situation occurs. Unless the situation is considered immediately life threatening, it is normal that no decisions will be taken until more information is available through an assessment and diagnosis process. However, the flight crew should use the time between first notification and the end of the assessment/diagnosis process to consider their diversion options and the implications of any diversion decision. Consultation with Company operations may be prudent at this stage.
