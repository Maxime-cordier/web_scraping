For anything other than a very minor medical complaint, the Purser or In-Charge Flight Attendant will normally make a PA announcement asking if there is a doctor or other qualified medical professional (nurse, paramedic etc) on board. If there is a positive response, the medical professional will be asked to assess the patient and to advise the crew of the best course of action. In the absence of a medical professional (or as a concurrent protocol), many air carriers have a standing arrangement with emergency medical service providers such as MedAire's MedLink or Stat MD. These service providers can be used both pre-flight and in-flight and can be contacted via satellite phone, high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHR) radio phone patch through an ARINC station or by means of Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) equipment. By one of these methods, direct communication with an emergency room/trauma centre physician is possible. Utilising checklists and forms supplied by the medical service provider, the flight attendants can establish and record the patient's personal history (sex, age, height and weight etc), their medical history (inclusive of pre-existing health issues, medication, previous illnesses or surgeries), their current vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure etc) and the symptoms that they are manifesting. The pilots will then relay this information to the service provider via one of the communications methods listed above for diagnosis and advice regarding on-board treatment, continuation of the flight or diversion. Should there be a requirement for medical support at the destination or at a diversion airfield, the service provider will also make those arrangements on behalf of the carrier.
