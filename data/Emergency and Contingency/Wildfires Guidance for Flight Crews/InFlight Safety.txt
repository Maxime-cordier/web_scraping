Once airborne, be cognizant of the fact that the situation within the fire zone is dynamic and can change very rapidly. The planned destination or alternate aerodromes can be rendered unusable with little warning. Fire suppression assets may be redeployed and associated airspace restrictions changed in response to movement of the fire. Pilots should: Wherever possible, take advantage of the additional protection and traffic separation offered by instrument flight rules (IFR);. Remain clear of restricted airspace and, if published, remain within transit corridors;. Closely monitor conditions at destination and alternate aerodromes;. Make appropriate position reports, especially whilst in uncontrolled airspace;. Maintain a listening watch on appropriate mandatory frequencies (MF) and on emergency frequencies;. Be mindful of the turbulence associated with wildfires;. Maintain a good lookout and understanding that low visibility conditions may exist due smoke haze from wildfires;. At uncontrolled aerodromes, broadcast intentions on the appropriate frequencies, make all required position reports, and follow the IFR or VFR protocols, appropriate to the rule status of the flight;. Make deviation or diversion decisions early. Always have an alternate plan;. Monitor fuel status. Have a predetermined minimum diversion (min div) or "bingo" fuel at which point diversion becomes mandatory; and,. Be aware that combustion products in smoke may be ingested into air conditioning systems, entering the cabin. Use of supplemental oxygen and/or smoke goggles may be necessary.. Be aware of the possibility of drones flying (illegally) in the vicinity of wildfires..
