Ground operations at aerodromes within close proximity to a major fire can be difficult. Smoke can obscure visibility, cause breathing difficulties and irritate the eyes. Heat from the fire can result in a significant rise in the ambient temperature and negatively affect aircraft performance. Strong, gusty surface winds can impede ground operations both on and off the airfield, fan and rapidly spread the fire, carry smoke a significant distance from the fire location, and potentially carry embers from the existing fire starting new ones. Pilots should be prepared for: Difficult and potentially dangerous conditions for conducting aircraft preflight inspection;. Potentially conjested ramps due to utilisation by aircraft conducting fire suppression or personnel evacuation operations;. Delays in ground services due both to conditions and to increased demand;. Restriction or suspension of refueling activities due proximity of the fire;. Delayed arrival of passengers and/or freight due to conditions outside the airport perimeter;. Runway changes due to change in wind or to fire movement;. The need to depart urgently due to changes in the path and trajectory of the fire;. The need to conduct out-of-wind or Tailwind Operations and the performance implications thereof;. Low visibility operations in smoke; and,. At takeoff, difficultly in visually confirming there are no aircraft or vehicles on the runway or aircraft on approach. This associated risk is greatly exacerbated if operating from an uncontrolled aerodrome..
