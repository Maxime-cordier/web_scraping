A wildfire, often also referred to as a forest fire, bush fire, brush fire, grass fire, coal or peat fire, is an uncontrolled fire caused by lightning, volcanic eruption or ignition related to human activity e.g. equipment generating sparks, unattended campfires, or arson. Areas with a mediterranean climate, KÃ¶ppen climate classification "hot dry-summer" climates (Csa) and "cool dry-summer" climates (classified Csb) are particularly susceptible to wildfires. Although by no means a new phenomena, wild fires appear to becoming more prevalant as the planet warms and changing climatic conditons result in localised drought. The Australian "Black Summer" bushfires of 2019-2020, the British Columbia, Canada, forest fires during the summer of 2021 and the Christmas 2021 wild fires in Colorado, USA, are all examples of more massive, more widespread, and even more unpredictable, or out of normal season, wild fires. A report published by the United Nations Environment Programme and GRID-Arendal in 2022 said, "Across Earth's ecosystems, wildfires are growing in intensity and spreading in range."
