The different service areas of an organisation should produce local crisis management plans based upon the policies and guiding principles contained in the ANSP crisis management policy. Local crisis management plans should in principle contain: Organisation related aspects: Description of local crisis management organisation;. Clear management structure;. List of members (and alternates) of the Crisis Management Team (CMT) with updated telephone contact details;. Individual roles and responsibilities;. Procedure for liaison with CEO;. Location: a meeting location for CMTs should be included in local CMTs. Although a dedicated location may not be required, it is essential that all facilities are available on-site;. Plans should also identify an off-site fall back in the event that the primary site is untenable.. Action related aspects: Process for notifying activation of the crisis management plan and the persons to be notified;. Establishing facts: it is essential the facts are gathered promptly; List of immediate actions with related checklist;. Business continuity plan;. Recovery plan;. Ending the crisis.. Recording and investigation: Details of any investigation process;. Process for recording information: an adequate record of events (i.e. a log book) should be kept, primarily to aid the CMT but also to assist with post-crisis analysis and any subsequent formal inquiry.. Communication aspects: Communication with staff;. A clear link with the corporate policy for dealing with media and public relations.. Lessons learned: Activities to get the lessons learned from the crisis management whenever a crisis management plan is activated in practice or for real – a post-crisis audit should follow to identify the lessons learned. The lessons learned should then be circulated within the organisation as relevant (e.g. to the owners of other units’ crisis management plans).. Other aspects: Other aspects where relevant, e.g. legal support..
