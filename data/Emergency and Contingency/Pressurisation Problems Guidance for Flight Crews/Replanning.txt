Having descended to 10,000 ft, there are a number of factors that must be considered. What are the captainâ€™s intentions?. What is the best route to fly to take into account factors such as terrain, weather, and fuel?. Is it appropriate to continue the flight to destination or should you land at the nearest suitable aerodrome? This decision depends on the circumstances of the depressurisation, the condition of the aircraft, and the condition of the passengers, as well as the planning considerations above.. Fuel burn will be greater at the lower altitude - do you have enough fuel to make the nearest diversion? Apply long range cruise techniques,. Consider the safety and performance implications of shutting down an engine in order to extend the range of the aircraft. It is very unlikely that a cruise engine shutdown would be considered on larger jets, but for some smaller jets and turboprops operating over the oceans it may be worth considering. If you do consider shutting down an engine, first check that the en route terrain clearance can be maintained on reduced power and adjust the route if necessary. It is prudent to configure the shut-down engine for immediate relight in case of a further emergency (cruise engine shutdown drills normally configure the engine for relight).. Consider flying at 14,000 ft with only the flight crew on oxygen..
