Best practices identified by EUROCONTROL and embedded in the ASSIST principle could be followed (A - Acknowledge; S - Separate, S - Silence; I - Inform, S - Support, T - Time) by air traffic controllers in case of RCF: A - acknowledge the RCF, determine if it is a partial or complete RCF;. S - separate the aircraft (accordingly, identified vs. unknown traffic) and if necessary, allow long final, keep the active runway clear of departures, arrivals and vehicles;. S - silence the non-urgent calls (as required), look for means to establish possible relay by other stations. I - inform the supervisor and all concerned ATC units as well as airport authorities at the destination or alternative aerodrome. S - support the flight by transmitting blind and providing any information considered necessary such as type of approach, runway length and aerodrome details, etc.. T - provide time for the crew to assess the situation and adhere to the RCF procedures.
