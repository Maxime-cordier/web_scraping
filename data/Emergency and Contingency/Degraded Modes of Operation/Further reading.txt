Degraded Modes Safety for Operational Engineering by EUROCONTROL (A brochure for the ATM engineering personnel aimed to provide overview of the degraded modes and understanding of the relationships between degraded modes and safety culture). For further information on Contingency Planning see the EUROCONTROL, Guidelines for Contingency Planning for Air Navigation Services (including Service Continuity) In particular for degraded modes of operation, see Chapter 8 of the guidelines on the Contingency Planning Process: Step 4 and Appendix G of the Guidelines on the Systems Engineering Perspective on Contingency Strategies. Contingency Planning of ANS-A practical case: Fire in a tower Practical case study, by Professor Chris Johnson. The Strategic Implications of Safety-Critical Software and Cyber Security on ATM Operations Introduction to the degraded modes of operation by Professor Chris Johnson.
