recommended that training should cover, as appropriate to the contingency measures foreseen to put in place: The contingency plan provisions at the unit in particular the emergency and degraded modes of operation.. “Taking over” from adjacent units.. Special Military situations;. Other situations as locally identified.. Training provision - Training for contingency operations can be facilitated by a variety of means including briefings, simulations and joint exercises. It should take place, as necessary, during: Initial Training (referenced only as part of the training for emergencies and unusual situations). Unit Training (e.g. OJT etc.). Continuation Training (e.g. refresher training, including possible Conversion Training on other HMIs. Development Training (e.g. Supervisor/Management training).. Strategy Specific Training - Some strategies impose additional training requirements. For instance, the high volume of traffic, and the complexity and configuration of airspace across ECAC makes the provision of Procedural Control extremely problematic particularly in congested areas of en route airspace. In less congested areas and for TMA/Approach Procedural Control could provide a limited capability provided that ATCOs are properly trained and endorsed. Continuation training will be necessary to maintain the special skills and validity of the appropriate endorsement/ rating. Similarly, other strategies have implications on training provision. For example, if ANSPs implement a multi-use approach then the use of a training centre as a location for fallback facilities will remove critical resources from those teams that now have to train additional ATCOs and engineering teams to use the contingency facilities. Contingency managers need to access the shared resource to run recuperation drills; the resource would then not be available for use by other members of an ANSP.
