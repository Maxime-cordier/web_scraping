Since its establishment in May 2010, the EACCC has been on alert on several occasions due to a number of major disruptions to the European aviation network. Over time, an additional role for the cell was identified – crisis aversion. Working closely with key players and decision makers, the EACCC seeks to ensure that communications are proportionate to the gravity of the event and its impact, in order to prevent overreaction and chaos in the network. To maintain its level of readiness the EACCC participated in ICAO volcanic ash exercises, VOLCEX 11/01 in April 2011 and VOLCEX 12/01 in April 2012, alongside EUROCONTROL, EC and EASA together with a number of airlines, ANSPs, CAAs and VAACs. The eruption of Grímsvötn in May 2011 required full activation of the cell. On that occasion the EACCC applied collaborative decision making to ensure comprehensive and coordinated actions across a number of aviation domains. The EACCC demonstrated its ability when formulating recommendations on actions to be taken in case of another volcanic eruption, recommendations that were the basis for the successful outcome of the VOLCEX exercises and the Grímsvötn eruption. Moreover, the cell has played a key role in facilitating the coordination and assurance of consistent messages on the status of the crisis, its management and evolution amongst the EACCC members.
