To mitigate the effect of fuel dumping, the following additional guidelines should be considered by ATCOs: Clear airspace in the immediate vicinity of the emergency aircraft - provide adequate horizontal and vertical separation between the aircraft dumping fuel and other traffic. If practicable, make use of dedicated fuel dumping areas. These are normally published in the AIP.. Try to vector the aircraft clear of populated areas during the fuel dump process. Determine the amount of time needed for the fuel dump. Consider the possibility of a blocked runway in the event that, after landing, the Pilot in Command elects to stop on the runway for an aircraft inspection.
