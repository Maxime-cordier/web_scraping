Fuel dump could be initiated without any forewarning and at almost any altitude, as might be the case should an engine failure, in combination with another performance limiting malfunction, occur on takeoff. Whilst it is likely that the pilot would declare an emergency in this situation, it is equally unlikely that they would have the time immediately available to detail any specific actions (including dumping fuel) that they might be taking. For a more benign circumstance such as a fuel dump due to diversion or turnback, it is likely that the pilot will pre-notify ATS and seek guidance/clearance for altitude and location prior to commencing the fuel dump.
