Fire in the air is one of the most hazardous situations that a flight crew can be faced with. Without aggressive intervention by the flight crew, a fire on board an aircraft can lead to the catastrophic loss of that aircraft within a very short space of time. Once a fire has become established, it is unlikely that the crew will be able to extinguish it. To stand any chance of survival in the face of an uncontrolled fire, the aircraft must land as soon as possible. The design of any modern airliner features sophisticated fire/smoke detection and suppression systems. System redundancy is achieved in many installations by doubling the number of detectors and separating the detection lines. However, the presence of any fire or smoke alarm, unless confirmed false, will virtually always result in the crewâ€™s decision for an immediate landing.
