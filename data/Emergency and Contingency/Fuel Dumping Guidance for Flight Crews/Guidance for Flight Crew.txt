The following general guidance is offered for flight crews: in all circumstances, follow manufacturer guidance for operation of the fuel dump system where a dump system is not fitted and the aircraft is heavier than maximum landing weight, ensure compliance with manufacturer criteria such as maximum touchdown rate of descent, minimum runway requirements, use of stopping devices, etc. where a dump system is not fitted and the aircraft is heavier than maximum landing weight, ensure compliance with manufacturer criteria such as maximum touchdown rate of descent, minimum runway requirements, use of stopping devices, etc. when appropriate, declare an emergency using the correct emergency communications protocols. whenever practicable, advise ATC prior to commencing fuel dump. If the situation allows, follow ATC instructions on dumping location and height. whenever practicable, dump fuel at or above an altitude that will allow evaporation or dissipation before the fuel reaches the ground. In most conditions, an altitude of 5000ft to 6000ft AGL is sufficient. there is generally no manufacturer restriction regarding fuel jettison during an in-flight fire, whether inside or outside the airplane. However, in the event of an uncontrollable fire, crews are advised not to delay landing and subsequent evacuation in order to reduce the landing weight by dumping fuel.
