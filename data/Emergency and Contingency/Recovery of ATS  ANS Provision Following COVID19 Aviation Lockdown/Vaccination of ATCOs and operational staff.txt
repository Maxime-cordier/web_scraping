In May 2021 EASA and EUROCONTROL published jointly Guidlines related to the COVID-19 vaccination of air traffic controllers (ATCOs) and operational staff. The documentation provided by the European Medicines Agency as part of the assessment process of the vaccines, as well as other published studies regarding the vaccines approved for use in Europe, note that some side-effects and adverse reactions could result from the vaccination, although this does not in any way call into question the overall safety of the vaccines. Although the vast majority of side effects reported so far are mild, they could be relevant in the safety context of ATCO tasks, and the Guidelines recommend that Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) should perform a risk assessment in accordance with their safety management system to identify whether the recommendations made in the EASA-EUROCONTROL guidelines should also be extended to their operational personnel on shift undertaking safety-related tasks. As these vaccines are new pharmacological products, EASA and EUROCONTROL provided recommendations for the National Competent Authorities (NCAs), ANSPs and ATCOs to ensure that any side-effects do not interfere with the execution of safety-related tasks.
