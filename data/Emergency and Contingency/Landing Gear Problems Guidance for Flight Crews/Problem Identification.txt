Consider any unusual occurrences prior to manifestation of the problem. For example an unusual noise or slow movement of landing gear on a previous sector. Is there any previous history of gear malfunctions in the aircraft Technical Log? If so, establish whether rectification was carried out or "no fault found" was recorded - the latter may indicate an intermittent fault.. When surface temperatures are low enough for frozen deposits to be present, consider whether the mechanisms might have become frozen during flight as a result of prior extended taxiing through slush or wet snow. Flight above the freezing level for prolonged periods may result in the landing gear becoming frozen in the retracted position. This is less of a problem on most modern commercial transport aircraft, where the gear bays are largely enclosed by doors unless retraction/extension is in progress, but is a relatively common occurrence on aircraft such as the LOCKHEED C-130. If it is suspected that taxiing through slush or wet snow may have led to deposits adhering to the landing gear assemblies, then it may be advisable to cycle the gear after initial post take off retraction to try and shed any deposits.. In an environment characterised by high levels of dust or fine sand, especially if the aircraft is not regularly exposed to it, consider if the landing gear mechanism may be jammed as a result of insufficient lubrication and contamination by sand and dust..
