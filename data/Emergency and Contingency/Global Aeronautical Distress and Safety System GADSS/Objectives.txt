From a high level perspective, the GADSS is designed to address three specific issues: The late notification of SAR services when aircraft are in distress. Missing or inaccurate end of flight aircraft position information (for example, the location of wreckage in the event of a crash). Lengthy and costly retrieval of flight data for accident investigation. The consequent objectives of the GADSS are therefore to: Ensure timely detection of aircraft in distress. Initiate search and rescue (SAR) actions as efficiently and as quickly as is possible. Ensure tracking of aircraft in distress and provide timely and accurate location of end of flight. Accurately direct SAR actions. Enable efficient and effective SAR operations. Ensure timely retrieval of flight data recorder data.
