Listed are some braking and deceleration issues that directly affect the aircraft performance: Overheated brakes - The kinetic energy lost by slowing an aircraft down is usually translated into heat by friction and could result in: Loss of braking performance Fire Tyre deflation / tyre burst. Loss of braking performance. Fire. Tyre deflation / tyre burst. Braking without or partial antiskid-protectionsignificantly increased landing distance required tyre deflation / tyre burst aircraft controllability issues. significantly increased landing distance required. tyre deflation / tyre burst. aircraft controllability issues. Brake failure and subsequent poor deceleration or degraded directional control in turn could result in: Runway excursion (both overrun and veer-off). Uncommanded aircraft ground movements / taxiway excursion. Collision with objects on the ground/other aircraft. Runway blockage due to immovability of an aircraft.
