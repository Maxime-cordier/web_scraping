Malfunctions or human errors related to application of brakes on landing and during taxi, but also during rejected take-offs, have been the cause of numerous accidents and incidents (See "Accidents and Incidents" section). Distraction, preoccupation and technical malfunction during the landing sequence as well as during rejected take-offs play a prominent role in many occurrences which result in overheated brakes and brake failures which subsequently involve increased levels of risk related to deceleration and directional control. There are various configurations of brake equipped undercarriage or main landing gear. Aircraft brakes are located on the main wheels and are usually selected by foot pedals but on some older aircraft types may be selected by hand controls. On most modern transport aircraft autobrake and anti-skid systems are provided. (For more information, see the dedicated article on aircraft brakes in SKYbrary.) Because brake and antiskid failures are often a direct consequence of hydraulics related problems or from faults in associated electrical/electronic control units, the flight crew may become aware of the emerging brake malfunction rather late into the flight, e.g. when they set up the autobrake system during their approach preparation. These systems are normally not needed during the cruise phase and because of that, the problem may not be relayed to ATC until the beginning of approach.
