An emergency descent is a manoeuvre for descending as rapidly as possible to a lower altitude (potentially, to the ground for an emergency landing). The need for this manoeuvre may result from an uncontrollable fire, a sudden loss of cabin pressurization, or any other situation demanding an immediate and rapid descent. The objective is to descend the aircraft as soon and as rapidly as possible, within the structural limitations of the aircraft.
