Note that weather radar cannot detect the small particle sizes of which ash clouds are composed. A combination of some of the following will occur if a significant concentration of volcanic ash is encountered: St Elmo's Fire caused by electrical discharges as small electrically charged rock particles impact the metal surface of the aircraft may be seen around the flight deck windscreens and on the leading edge of engine nacelles. a “search light” effect may be observable at the engine intakes - as if a light is shining from within the engines through the fan blades. the appearance of very fine dust haze within the cabin and the possible visible settlement of dust on surfaces.. an acrid electrical or sulphurous smell from the air conditioning system.. engine surges and power fluctuations especially when occurring on more than one engine.
