For further information on Contingency Planning see the EUROCONTROL, Guidelines for Contingency Planning for Air Navigation Services (including Service Continuity). In particular, page 66 of the guidelines deals with military aspects of contingency where military action can force ANSPs to resort to contingency operations. Contingency operations can also have an impact on military capability - if for example, ANSPs use military facilities in fallback operations, these issues are considered on page 117 of the guidelines..
