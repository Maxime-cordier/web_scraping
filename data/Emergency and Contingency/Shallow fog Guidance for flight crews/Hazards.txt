Viewed from above, the fog may not obscure aerodrome layout or runway markings but on final approach visual references may be lost, particularly in the flare. The presence of shallow fog may make taxy and takeoff difficult depending on ambient lighting conditions, the clarity of taxiway and runway markings, and the intensity of taxiway and runway lighting.
