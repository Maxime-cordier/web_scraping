Controllers are expected to provide the most appropriate advice/information to pilots of an aircraft requesting navigational assistance when avoiding areas of adverse weather. ICAO Doc 4444 (PANS-ATM), contains the following provisions on information to be given to flight crews in weather avoidance scenarios: Doc 4444 - 8.6.9 Information regarding adverse weather - 8.6.9.1. Doc 4444 - 8.6.9 Information regarding adverse weather - 8.6.9.2. In controlled airspace, a pilot using an aircraft radar and intending to detour around observed weather, must obtain a clearance from the controller before doing so. Even so, controllers should not be surprised if, perhaps because of communications difficulty and the flight safety risks, an aircraft alters course without clearance. If it is necessary to leave controlled airspace the pilot must request permission to re-join. ICAO Doc 4444 (PANS-ATM) provides the following procedures intended for deviations around adverse meteorological conditions: Doc 4444 - 15.2.3.1 Procedures related to emergencies, communication failure and contingencies - 15.2.3.1.1. Doc 4444 - 15.2.3.1 Procedures related to emergencies, communication failure and contingencies - 15.2.3.1.2. The crews should notify ATC and request clearance to deviate from track, advising, when possible, the extent of the deviation expected, expressed in new heading and for how long the crew intends to proceed on the deviation heading. Doc 4444 - 15.2.3.2 Actions to be taken when controller-pilot communications are established - 15.2.3.2.2. Doc 4444 - 15.2.3.2 Actions to be taken when controller-pilot communications are established - 15.2.3.2.3.
