It is important that pilots, as an absolute minimum, should clearly understand the following emergency hand signals that may be issued by rescue and fire-fighting personnel, and also by marshallers and ground crew when indicating the location of a fire (e.g. engine, APU, brakes). In an emergency it is always preferable, but not always possible or expedient, to communicate using voice via radio or interphone. At night lit wands will improve the chances of the signal being seen, however, some degree of ambient light may be necessary for the message to be understood.
