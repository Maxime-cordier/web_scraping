The current reality is that many air traffic controllers (ATCOâ€™s) could go through extensive periods of time without having to deal with emergency or abnormal traffic situations. These are situations which present anything out of the ordinary. Because of this infrequency, it is crucial that ATCOs maintain a level of constant awareness and be kept in practice for dealing with any potential situation to ensure that safety is not compromised when an unusual/emergency event occurs.
