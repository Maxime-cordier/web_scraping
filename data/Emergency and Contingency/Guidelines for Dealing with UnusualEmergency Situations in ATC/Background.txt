In April 1996 a workshop was held at the EUROCONTROL Institute of Air Navigation Services (IANS), Luxembourg on the handling of unusual and emergency situations. As a result of the workshop a deliverable titled “Guidelines for Controller Training in the Handling of Unusual/Emergency Situations” was produced in 2003. The background material for the deliverable has been provided by Germany, Switzerland, The United Kingdom and The Netherlands. Additional input and advice was provided by aircrew personnel from Deutsche Lufthansa (DLH). In “Guidelines for Controller Training in the Handling of Unusual/Emergency Situations” a ‘checklist’ approach is proposed for use by EUROCONTROL in order to ensure proper handling of any unusual and emergency situation which requires controller action. These checklists are designed to help the supervisor as well as the controller(s) handling the unusual or emergency situation. The idea of the checklists is to create step by step plans on how to work for the common goal, and to better coordinate the operation. An observer/ assistant working with the controller who uses the checklist will be in a position to provide better quality support as it will be clear what the controller is doing, including the sequence of the completed and pending actions.
