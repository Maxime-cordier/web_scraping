In a changing situation, the course of action adopted by the crew may need to be revised more than once. It is important that the crew continues to think ahead and consider what they will do if, for example, the chosen alternate destination ceases to be available. The development of alternative courses of action and the critique of current plans should be encouraged. Good planning is the foundation of good airmanship and those pilots who consider their options and constantly update them - discussing them with the rest of the crew - are always ahead of the game and less likely to get caught out. Always keep another card up your sleeve Do not be afraid to declare an emergency if necessary
