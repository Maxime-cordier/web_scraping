a primary radar that generally covers a smaller area. Note that if there are no primary radars available, the aircraft will not be seen on the controller's screen at all. In this case, the information about its presence may have been received by another aircraft, a neighbouring ATS unit, a military agency or another external source.. An aircraft is discovered by radars after climbing above certain altitude. Even if the transponder is operational, it may be using a non-discrete code (e.g. 2000) which could make identification more difficult.. An aircraft enters the aispace of an ATS unit without making contact and without the controller receiving any information from the upstream ATS unit. This may happen for a variety of reasons, e.g. the upstream controller not forwarding appropriate information (e.g. an estimate) or the flight being under control of a military agency.. When a controller is informed that an unknown aircraft has entered their airspace, they would make every effort to establish contact and identify it, as specified in the local instructions. Example actions include: trying to contact the aircraft on the available frequencies (including the emergency frequency 121.5 MHz).. inquiring other ATS units (within the FIR or in neighbouring FIRs) about the aircraft and requesting their assistance in establishing contact.. inquiring the appropriate military authorities.. attempting to obtain information from other aircraft within the area where the unidentified aircraft is observed or has been reported to be.. After the aircraft has been identified, the controller would inform the military authorities in accordance with local instructions.
