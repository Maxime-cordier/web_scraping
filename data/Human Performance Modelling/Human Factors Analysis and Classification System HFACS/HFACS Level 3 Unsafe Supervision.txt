The Unsafe Supervision level is divided into four categories. Inadequate Supervision: The role of any supervisor is to provide their staff with the opportunity to succeed, and they must provide guidance, training, leadership, oversight, or incentives to ensure the task is performed safely and efficiently.. Plan Inappropriate Operation: Refers to those operations that can be acceptable and different during emergencies, but unacceptable during normal operation (e.g., risk management, crew pairing, operational tempo).. Fail to Correct Known Problem: Refers to those instances when deficiencies are known to the supervisor, yet are allowed to continue unabated (e.g, report unsafe tendencies, initiate corrective action, correct a safety hazard).. Supervisory Violation: Refers to those instances when existing rules and regulations are willfully disregarded by supervisors (e.g., enforcement of rules and regulations, authorized unnecessary hazard, inadequate documentation)..
