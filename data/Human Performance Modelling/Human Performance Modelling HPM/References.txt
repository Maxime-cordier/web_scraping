Human Performance Modeling in Aviation, edited by David C. Foyle, NASA Ames Research Center, and Becky L. Hooey, San Jose State University Research Foundation at NASA Ames Research Center; CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC; 2008. “An ACT-R Approach to Closing the Loop on Computational Cognitive Modeling: Describing the Dynamics of Interactive Decision Making and Attention Allocation,” by Michael Byrne, Alex Kirlik and Michael Fleetwood. The five modeling tools used in the NASA HPM project were: Adaptive Control of Thought–Rational (ACT-R); Improved Performance Research Integration Tool/ACT-R hybrid (IMPRINT/ ACT-R); Air Man–Machine Integration Design and Analysis System (Air MIDAS); Distributed Operator Model Architecture (D–OMAR); and Attention–Situation Awareness (A–SA). “Air MIDAS: A Closed-Loop Model Framework,” by Kevin M. Corker, Koji Muraoka, Savita Verma, Amit Jadhav and Brian F. Gore.. “An ACT-R Approach to Closing the Loop on Computational Cognitive Modeling: Describing the Dynamics of Interactive Decision Making and Attention Allocation,” by Michael Byrne, Alex Kirlik and Michael Fleetwood..
