A successful pilot support programme can be recognized by the following benchmarks: Pilot Driven: Although these programmes may involve multiple stakeholders and be multi-participant, they are oﬀered and run by pilots, for pilots with the goal that no harm is done to those they seek to support.. Independence and Autonomy: Pilot peer support programmes act as an independent, autonomous “port-of-call/ safe haven” dedicated to providing peer support to pilots.. Transparency: Pilot peer support programmes need to operate with trust and integrity and deliver clear protocols.. Confdentiality: Confdentiality requires that personal information shared stays within the program regardless of its form or source. All information collected can only be used to provide support to pilots. It is understood that there are limits to confdentiality when safety could be compromised and there needs to be clear protocols for escalation of such cases..
