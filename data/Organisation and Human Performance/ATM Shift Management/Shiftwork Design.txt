The research emphasises that a best shift system in ATM cannot be defined. The specific conditions of the work situation, the workload, its spatial and temporal distribution, the individual conditions such as age, attitude, and social support as well as the organisational frame play a vital role in the design of shift systems. However, taking into account the findings from existing research the following guidelines are provided for shiftwork design. For best practices recommendations[1] on shift design derived from the literature review, see Figure 1 below.
