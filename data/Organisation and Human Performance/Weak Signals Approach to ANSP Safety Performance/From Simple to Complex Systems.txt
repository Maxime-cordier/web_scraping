Meanwhile aviation is a complex socio-technological system in which complex interactions and couplings are relevant factors with regard to safety management. Both are characterised by Perrow (1984)[2] as “tight couplings” (e.g. delays in processing are not possible, little slack available) and “complex inter-activeness” (e.g. many feedback loops, limited understanding and indirect information) of the system components. Due to the dynamic of complex interactions and couplings the adjustments are always approximate and the system performance has always a specific degree of uncertainty. Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems as part of the aviation system is changing while operating and therefore, cannot be described completely. The research has shown that in other domains like economy, ecology or journalism a weak signals approach was taken in order to cope with the uncertainty of future developments in complex systems.
