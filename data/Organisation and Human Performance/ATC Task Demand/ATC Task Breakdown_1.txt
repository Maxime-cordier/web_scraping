Specifically, human factors elements at the task level are: Workload: The demands of a task or job role that are imposed on an individual. Controller workload refers to cognitive workload. It is generally agreed that controllerâ€™s workload is a subjective and individual response by a controller to given task load situation, and that either personal factors (e.g. skill, experience, stress) or contextual factors (e.g. time pressure, noise, stressors, distraction, organisational change issues) can all influence workload. One of the greatest staffing challenges during workload extremes (that is in high/low workload situations) is matching available workforce to the current traffic level. A mismatch between the two can impact controller fatigue and even jeopardise safety. However, it is clear that the high-workload situation is not the only one for concern; low-traffic periods carry their own risks (e.g. reduced vigilance and therefore the possible failure to notice critical events). Performance Standards: The level of performance at which a staff member is expected to maintain. The term performance refers to the ability of controllers to carry out their tasks (maintain situation awareness etc.), while maintaining a certain level of effectiveness. The relationships among workload, performance, and effectiveness are complex and contextually specific. To determine the performance standards for air traffic controllers, researchers within industry utilise the human performance models which provide a way of addressing these relationships. By building a human performance model that simulates how controllers carry out their tasks it is possible to generate more accurate predictions of future ATC task demands. Furthermore, by taking into account strategies that controllers use to minimize the amount of control activity required to meet their objectives, one can more accurately predict the effects of demands on both mental workload and performance. For example such strategies could be using various scanning methods for identifying potential conflicts, addressing the conflict or building a strategy for addressing it, well before the situation begins to develop. Roles and Responsibilities: A description of each role and the associated day to day responsibilities. With assigned specific roles, functions and responsibilities, the controllers interact dynamically and interdependently with the other users within the ATM system, while at the same time needing to maintain the required performance standards. Task interruption and distraction: Anything (i.e. actions / communications / cognitive mental activity) that breaks the flow pattern of ongoing activities. Interruptions and distractions are frequently faced by controllers and can lead to significant safety problems. Interruptions (e.g., due to phone calls, non-standard events and communications) and distractions (e.g., due to a loud conversation among others at the OPS room, ambient noise e.g. air conditioning) do occur. Some cannot be avoided and therefore must be coped with by the controllers. Others can be minimized or eliminated through training, adoption of effective procedures, discipline and the use of good judgment. If the number of interruptions and distractions is not minimized or the impact of residual interruptions and distractions is not controlled, flight safety can be affected. In particular, when a controller is disturbed while monitoring or
