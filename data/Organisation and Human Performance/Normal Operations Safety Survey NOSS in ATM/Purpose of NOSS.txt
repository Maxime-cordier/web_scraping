The purpose of conducting a NOSS in an organisation is to find out what are the most pertinent threats and errors that controllers have to manage during normal operations and how these are managed. NOSS thus captures ATC system performance through the eyes of the air traffic controllers. Once that information is available, the SMS of the organisation can propose adjustments in the operational processes as required (e.g. changes in procedures, or specific safety topics for recurrent training programmes for air traffic controllers) as countermeasures to the threats and errors that the controllers are confronted with on a daily basis. By conducting follow-up NOSSs, an organisation will be provided with feedback on the effects of its safety change process since the previous NOSS.
