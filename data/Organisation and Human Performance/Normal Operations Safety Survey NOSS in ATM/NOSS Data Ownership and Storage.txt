The data from a NOSS is owned by the ATS provider organisation that conducted the NOSS. However NOSS data are sensitive material that potentially could be abused if taken out of context. Therefore a trusted site should be selected and assigned to store the data after they have been collected and analysed. Circumstances that can help determine whether or not an air traffic services provider should store NOSS data in-house comprise inter alia: the national legislation on freedom of information (i.e. to the press and the public), the status of the air traffic services provider (e.g. part of the government or a corporatized entity) and, last but not least, the need to be able to benchmark or otherwise compare the data with other organisations where a NOSS has been done. Alternative locations for storing NOSS data could include, but are not limited to, universities or aviation research laboratories in the State or region of the air traffic services provider.
