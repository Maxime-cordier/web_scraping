In all situations, FLARM is an aid to the “see and be seen” principle rather than a substitute. In any case the basic safety principle of VFR flight must never be neglected just because a detection aid, and especially one that in its basic form provides only collision avoidance protection against similarly-quipped aircraft, is available. It is imperative that the limitations of the FLARM equipment installed in a small aircraft or helicopter must be understood by those using it.
