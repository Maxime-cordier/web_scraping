The structured scan is a technique used by controllers to confirm that the clearance that is about to be issued is safe. Prior to making an executive decision the controller should scan all of the appropriate information, including the situation display and the flight data (strips or other information). It is akin to crossing the road. Listen, check right, check left, check right again. In ATC, it is check situation display, check flight data (strips), check co-ordinations agreed, evaluate immediate situation and the immediate and future implications (in the own sector and often in the adjacent sector) – all to be done between “standby” and “affirm”. Structured Scan has the potential to prevent most losses of separation caused by Blind Spot. Surveillance information may be suppressed or diffused. Track labels may be obscured and flight data displays may not be arranged in an optimal way to immediately highlight a particular conflict. Time pressure and workload may erode the controller’s attention and working knowledge may then become layered and then filtered. When a controller comes under pressure, a “return to basics” technique such as using a structured scan before making an executive decision would reduce the likelihood of an error.
