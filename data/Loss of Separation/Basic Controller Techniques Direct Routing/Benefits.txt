Direct routing is arguably the technique that most favoured by both pilots and controllers. The former consider that it would enable them to reach their destination earlier while the latter consider they provide more efficient service. The benefits of direct routing include: Delay compensation. If a flight has experienced delay for whatever reason (late departure, adverse weather avoiding, etc.), clearing it to fly on a direct route can compensate this, at least in part.. Increase of flight efficiency due to reduced fuel burn.. Reduction of flight time. This is especially helpful in emergency situations where reaching the chosen landing aerodrome earlier can be crucial.. Conflict solving. Similar to vectoring, a direct route may change the track of a flight, thereby resulting in achieving the necessary horizontal separation or providing additional time to achieve vertical separation. However, unlike vectoring, direct routing shortens the flight path, thus achieving both safety and efficiency.. Neutrality. If used after vectoring, the direct routing can compensate the extended flight path (and time) so that a zero net effect is achieved.. Mitigating wake turbulence (as an alternative to parallel offset). Easier conflict calculation. If an aircraft flies on a direct route, its direction will remain the same and speed fluctuation will be kept to a minimum in most cases. Naturally, for climbing/descending aircraft or under specific weather circumstances, this statement will not be true.. The aircraft continues to fly using own navigation. This is especially beneficial in case of [[loss of radio communication]] as the flight path will be more predictable..
