Taking into account the total expected effect on airspace capacity, provision of ATS and safety, real time simulations have been carried out by EUROCONTROL with the main objective of verifying these expectations. The feedback from controllers has also been taken into account. It should be stated that not all the expectations have been met. For example: From all the instructions given by the en-route sector, only the number of “Level change” has been increased during the VLJ scenarios.. In TMA with two controllers at the sector, only the number of issued “direct instructions” has been increased.. Provision of ATS to VLJ is linked to the ability of the ATCO to assess correctly the situation and during the course of the simulations more Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) have been recorded..
