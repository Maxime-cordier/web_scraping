A duplicated SSR code is a situation where two (or more) aircraft are squawking the same SSR code while being observable by the same controller. The primary risk with duplicated SSR codes is that an aircraft could be mis-identified. That is, the controller would believe that a specific track corresponds to a particular aircraft while in reality this would not be the case. Consequently, the controller would issue clearances believing they will be complied with by one aircraft but in fact another one (which may also be in the airspace of another sector) will perform the action. An example duplicated SSR code situation. The aircraft that is approaching point ENTRY is about to be transferred by ATS Unit A to ATS Unit B. If (for any reason) the other aircraft (in the middle of Unit B's airspace) calls Unit A, the controller there may misidentify it as the one approaching the boundary. Then, seeing the conflict with IVB95, they may issue a descent instruction to the new aircraft in order to solve the conflict. However, the instruction will actually be complied with by the aircraft that is exiting Unit B to the south, causing a conflict with the one flying against it 1000 ft below
