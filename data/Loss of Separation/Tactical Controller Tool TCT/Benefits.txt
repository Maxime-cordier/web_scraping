TCT is one of the most helpful tools developed for the executive controller. The main benefits of its use are: Saves time – the ATS system calculates the conflicts (and sometimes gives advice) which allows the controller to focus on other tasks (e.g. hear-back, planning, scanning, etc.).. Reduces unnecessary controller interventions – TCT is usually more precise than the combination of standard range and bearing measurement tools and manual calculation. As a result, in many cases the aircraft are subject to simpler (e.g. locking of headings) or no intervention.. Mitigates “Blind Spots” – if used, the TCT may discover most short-term conflicts.. Provides continuous feedback on clearance effectiveness – e.g. in case the controller chooses to apply vectoring, the TCT (almost) immediately evaluates the new heading(s).. Enables the controller to perform “softer” interventions – if the controller calculates the conflict mentally, they usually apply techniques to accommodate errors (e.g. round values to worst case scenarios, “safety buffers” for measuring tools to compensate the uncertainty of the closest point of approach, etc.). The ATS system calculates the closest point of approach with great accuracy which allows the controller to issue clearances that result is smaller aircraft deviations.. Resolution advisories (depending on local implementation) – the TCT may be equipped with an advisory feature that suggests action for conflict solving (e.g. “ACFT A should turn 10 degrees to the right”)..
