Controllers may provide traffic information to pilots or request pilots to pass the information to the other crews. Pilots may also request traffic information. In controlled airspace some flights may not be provided with air traffic clearances but they must receive traffic information from ATC. For example, in class “C” airspace VFR flights receive traffic information in respect of other IFR and VFR flights. (Further information about the type of air traffic services provided in the different classes of airspace is available in the Classification of Airspace article.) According to ICAO Doc 4444 provisions the traffic information message shall comply with the following phraseology: To pass traffic information a) (ATC) TRAFFIC (information); b) (ATC) NO REPORTED TRAFFIC; To acknowledge traffic information c) (Pilot) LOOKING OUT; d) (Pilot) TRAFFIC IN SIGHT; e) (Pilot) NEGATIVE CONTACT (reasons); f) (ATC) (ADDITIONAL) TRAFFIC (direction) BOUND (type of aircraft) (level) ESTIMATED (or OVER) (significant point) AT (time); g) (ATC) TRAFFIC IS (classification) UNMANNED FREE BALLOON(S) WAS [or ESTIMATED] OVER (place) AT (time) REPORTED (level(s)) (or LEVEL UNKNOWN) MOVING (direction) (other pertinent information, if any). Traffic information can be also included in the ATC clearances concerning take off, landing and multiple line-ups. Where reduced runway separation minima between aircraft for the same runway is used, the provision of traffic information to the flight crew of concerned succeeding aircraft is a condition for application of the reduced runway separation minima.
