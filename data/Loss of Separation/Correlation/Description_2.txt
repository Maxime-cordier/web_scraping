use) or OLDI messages (universally applicable though not as customizable).. Ability to enter data directly into the aircraft label (e.g. cleared level, planned entry and exit levels, speed/heading clearances, etc.). Availability of more system tools, e.g. MTCD, deviation alerts, etc. Note that Safety Nets and some controller tools (e.g. TCT) will work even on uncorrelated tracks.. All the above mentioned benefits may be substituted by other means of obtaining the information or performing the procedure. For instance, aircraft equipment, departure, destination, routing, etc. can be seen in the Flight Plan message and coordination may be done by phone. However, when available in the aircraft label, these features greatly improve the controller's situational awareness thus allowing them to focus on high level tasks such as conflict detection and the establishment of efficient flow of traffic. While correlation works smoothly most of the time, there are situations requiring extra controller attention: No flight plan. If no flight plan has been received, correlation is still possible provided that an OLDI ACT message has been received. In this case, however, the information in the system is limited to the contents of the ACT message, so for example there will be no trajectory (and hence, no MTCD warnings will be displayed and no OLDI messages will be sent). The system is usually designed in such a way as to inform the controllers of the situation so that they can take appropriate action, e.g. call the previous ATS unit for further information or send an RQP (request flight plan) message to the IFPS.. Wrong automatic correlation. This sometimes happens when the SSR code is used. For example, if an ACT message is received but the aircraft is not within surveillance cover yet, the system may correlate the flight plan to a track with the same SSR code somewhere else. This error is usually obvious to the controller since the correlated aircraft is likely to be in a completely unexpected portion of the airspace and fly in an illogical direction which will make the controller investigate the matter closely. Once the situation is clear, the solution is simple - the controller de-correlates the wrong track and performs a manual correlation with the right one (after it appears on the screen). Note that if the estimate is received when both aircraft are within surveillance cover, the system will most likely indicate the double SSR code and will not perform an automatic correlation.. Wrong manual correlation. While the controller is able to match any flight plan with any system track (and thus compensate for situation where automatic correlation has failed for some reason) this also makes possible for them to create a wrong association. In turn, this could lead to a wrong identification. It is therefore important to perform manual correlation with increased attention and use appropriate identification methods, e.g. an istruction to squawk IDENT or report the SSR code and not callsign recognition (unless the callsign/SSR code match has been verbally confirmed by the previous controller)..
