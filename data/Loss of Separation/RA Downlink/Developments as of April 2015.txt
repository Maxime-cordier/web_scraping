Since the late 2000s, downlink was available in some commercial systems and a number of ANSPs had decided to implement it. Conversely, the UK CAA specifically requested that UKâ€™s ANSP do not use RA downlink supplied in their ATM systems. There were no ICAO provisions regarding RA downlink and concepts of operations varied between places where RA downlink had been implemented. The level of detail of RA information displayed to controllers varies between places. The RA downlink research undertaken by SESAR P04.08.01 has been inconclusive, as real-time simulation have not been conducted. In 2015 EUROCONTROL and DFS legal service jointly published a paper on RA downlink legal responsibility aspects.
