The process of combining plots into a track is called tracking. Plots from consecutive scans are examined, and if the required criteria are matched, they are declared by the system to have come from the same aircraft. Thus, tracks are created. They can be: primary, secondary or combined, depending on the sensor used.. mono- or multiradar, depending on the number of sensors used.. In monoradar tracking, data from a single radar is used to create tracks. In multiradar tracking, tracks coming from different sensors are combined (averaged) so that a single track is output for each target. The multiradar track has the advantage of being more reliable. It should be noted, however, that the position of the track on the situational display does not represent the actual position of the aircraft but is result from approximation and averaging. Consequently, the distance between two tracks is in most cases not the same as the actual distance between the aircraft. Tracks provide additional information: machine speed (an approximation of groundspeed, calculated from the difference of plot positions). Available for all tracks.. vertical speed (calculated from the difference of Mode C readouts in consecutive plots). Only available for secondary and combined tracks.. history (the positions of previous plots). Available for all tracks.. predict vector (extrapolated future position based on the assumption that the aircraft will continue to fly straight ahead and maintain ground speed). Available for all tracks.. ATM procedures sometimes depend on the sensor that provides information about a particular track. For this reason, different symbols are used to represent e.g. primary tracks, secondary tracks, tracks that are obtained from a particular radar, ADS-B tracks, etc. Examples of different track symbols: 1 - primary, 2 - secondary, 3 - combined, 4 - ADS-B. Note that these are not intended to represent any real life system.
