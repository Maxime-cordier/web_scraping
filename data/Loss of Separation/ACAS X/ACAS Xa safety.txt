ACAS Xa/Xo is designed to be safer than TCAS II, while improving operational suitability. The FAA conducted safety studies during the ACAS Xa standardisation process that indicate ACAS Xa provides overall safety and operational improvements. These studies indicate that ACAS Xa improves safety by 20% on the United States encounter model and reduces the overall alerting rate by 65% on recorded radar tracks in US airspace. The improvement is most visible in case of preventive (Monitor Vertical Speed) RAs where 97% of TCAS II RAs were removed by ACAS Xa resulting in only an ACAS Xa TA. This is attributed to higher quality ADS-B data (used by ACAS Xa rather than active surveillance used by TCAS II) proving a better estimate of present and future state of intruder aircraft. A European ACAS Xa validation study concluded that there are several benefits from ACAS Xa compared to TCAS II: When pilots follow their RAs, ACAS Xa logic provides an increased safety benefit of between 16% and 24% (depending upon whether or not the intruding aircraft have ADS-B out).. When one pilot does not follow their RA, ACAS Xa provides an increased safety benefit of about 47% .. ACAS Xa reduces the overall number of RAs by about 60%..
