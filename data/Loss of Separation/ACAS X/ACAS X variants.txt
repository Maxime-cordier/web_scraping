As well as the standard ACAS X (known as ACAS XA) variants are under consideration to extend collision avoidance protection to situations and user classes that currently do not benefit from TCAS II: ACAS XA – The general purpose ACAS X that makes active interrogations to detect intruders. ACAS XA is the baseline system, the successor to TCAS II. ACAS XA /XO standards were published by RTCA DO-385 and EUROCAE ED-256 in September 2018. Amendments to ICAO provisions and regulatory approval for ACAS XA /XO are pending.. ACAS XO – ACAS XO is an extension to ACAS XA designed for particular operations, like closely spaced parallel approaches, for which ACAS XA is less suitable because it might generate a large number of nuisance alerts. ACAS XA /XO standards were published by RTCA DO-385 and EUROCAE ED-256 in September 2018. Amendments to ICAO provisions and regulatory approval for ACAS XA /XO are pending.. ACAS XU – Designed for Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), incorporating horizontal resolution manoeuvres. ACAS XU standards were published in September 2020 by RTCA as DO-386 and by EUROCAE as ED-275. Amendments to ICAO provisions and regulatory approval for ACAS XU are pending.. ACAS sXU – ACAS sXU is an extension of ACAS XU intended for small Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), with wing span less than 50 feet (approximately 15 meters). Work on ACAS sXU Standards has already started and is expected to be completed in 2022.. ACAS XR (rotorcraft) – A future version of ACAS X intended for rotorcraft (helicopters). At the time of writing, the Standards are expected to be developed by 2024.. ACAS XP – A future version of ACAS X that relies solely on passive ADS-B to track intruders and does not make active interrogations. It is intended for general aviation aircraft (that are not currently required to fit TCAS II)..
