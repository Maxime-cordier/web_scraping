Report heading - in case the heading cannot be determined by other means (e.g. Mode S). Continue present heading - this instruction is also called "locking". Fly heading [three digits] - the pilot is expected to turn in the direction that would achieve the desired heading faster.. Turn (left/right) heading (three digits) - this instruction specifies both the new heading and the direction of the turn.. Turn (left/right) (number of degrees) degrees - this instruction is similar to the previous, the difference being that the heading given is relative (to the present heading) rather than absolute.. Resume own navigation direct (point) - after the goal of vectoring is complete, this instruction is used to get the aircraft join the flight planned route.. Note: Heading instructions are usually given in multiples of five, e.g. 055, 100, 115, 235, 260, etc. Each digit is pronounced separately (e.g. 100 is "one zero zero" and not "one hundred").
