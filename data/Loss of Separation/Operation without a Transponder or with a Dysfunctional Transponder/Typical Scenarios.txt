A total loss of transponder information may happen due to a number of factors, e.g.: Poor surveillance coverage (e.g. due to terrain, low altitude or surveillance sensor failure);. Transponder technical failure;. Other avionics failure (e.g. a restart of an aircraft system leading to the transponder being switched to standby mode);. Flight crew not turning the transponder on;. Flight crew accidentally switching the transponder to standby mode;. Flight crew switching transponder to standby mode after miscommunication with the controller.. Intermittent or corrupted mode C signal may be caused by various technical faults of the on-board equipment or by radar detection failures. Duplicate Mode S addresses although unlikely, may happen due to: Technical fault in the avionics;. Transponder being transferred from one aircraft to another.. Incorrect Mode S address of newly delivered or registered aircraft (due to block allocation of addresses to aircraft within a state);. ATC system failures may sometimes result in outcomes similar to transponder failure, e.g.: Flight level data of surveillance tracks being swapped (e.g. if an aircraft is right above/below another);. A surveillance track being dropped (e.g. if an aircraft is right above/below another)..
