The most common transponder failure types classified by feature are: Mode A code only (Aircraft Identifier);. Mode C information only (Altitude data);. Mode S 24-bit address only, which may result in unidentified aircraft being present on the situational display or a wrong surveillance track to flight plan correlation;. Total failure (A, C & S), which may result in the aircraft disappearing from the controller's situational display.. Partial loss of transponder functionality (e.g. operational at reduced power limiting transponder detection by ATC radar and/or other aircraft).. The most common transponder failures classified by the severity of the failure are: Total loss (feature not available);. Corrupted (feature operating but wrong data output);. Intermittent (feature working with interruptions);. Duplicated (two or more aircraft transmitting the same information).. The transponder failure can be characterised by a feature failure and a severity element. Of course, some combinations are inappropriate (e.g. duplicated mode C).
