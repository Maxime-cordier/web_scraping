Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approach (SOIA) is a procedure used to conduct simultaneous approaches to runways spaced less than 3,000' (915m), but at least 750' (230m) apart. The SOIA procedure utilizes an ILS PRM approach to one runway and an offset Localizer Type Directional Aid (LDA) PRM approach with glide slope or an RNAV PRM or GLS PRM approach utilizing vertical guidance to the adjacent runway. SOIA require No Transgression Zone (NTZ) monitoring, special pilot training and a dedicated Attention All Users Page (AAUP) as described in the Simultaneous Close Parallel PRM Approach article. ATC directed breakout procedures are in force. Whilst there are many common procedures and similarities between SOIA and Simultaneous Close Parallel Approaches, there are also some notable differences.
