This article describes vectoring from a geometric point of view. It elaborates on: Conflict geometry, which determines the need of vectoring, i.e. the calculations performed to determine whether controller intervention would be necessary;. Factors affecting the controller's choice of aircraft to be vectored;. How the direction of the turn is determined; and,. Impact of the track crossing angle on the situation in terms of separation gained by vectoring and separation lost after the crossing point..
