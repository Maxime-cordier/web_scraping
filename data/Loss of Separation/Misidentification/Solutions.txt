System support. The introduction of Mode S greatly reduces the chance of an undetected wrong correlation. While, depending on system logic and crew actions, correlation may be based on the SSR code or an incorrect aircraft identification can be input by the pilot, there is usually an indication that warns the controller of an inconsistency.. Careful listening during initial contact. This applies to both pilots and controllers. If the controller expects a call from an aircraft but receives one that is "slightly" different (e.g. ABC121 instead of ABC122) or "slightly" unreadable (e.g. ABC12*) they need to seek clarification. Any wrong or unheard symbol must be challenged. The pilot, on the other hand, should listen to the controller's "identified" message and if it seems to be addressing a different aircraft, confirmation should be sought or the initial contact reiterated, as applicable. What should not be done is assuming that the controller has identified the aircraft although the callsign used is "slightly" different to the actual one.. Prompt reaction in case it is suspected that an aircraft has changed frequency when it should not have.. Measures that mitigate the impact of callsign similarity. For example, airlines may plan their flights so that similar flight numbers are not within the same airspace at the same time. Controllers should be more careful when using abbreviated callsigns..
