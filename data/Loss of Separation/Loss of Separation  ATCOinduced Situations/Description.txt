Loss of separation between aircraft sometimes occurs as a result of action taken (or not taken) by the ATCO. In most cases this involves one or more of the following scenarios: Flight clearance does not provide adequate separation from other traffic.. ATCO does not detect developing potential conflict.. Avoiding action issued is too late or inadequate to provide safe separation.. Instruction not received or not understood by intended recipient due to breakdown in air-ground communications.. The controller issues a clearance that creates a conflict with a neighbouring aircraft due to the blind spot effect.. When issuing descent clearance to ABC123, the controller spots both PQR265 and XYZ312 but overlooks DEF763
