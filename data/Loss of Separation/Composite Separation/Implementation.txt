At present, composite separation may be applied between aircraft operating at or above FL 290 within the flexible Pacific Organized Track Systems (PACOTS), North Pacific (NOPAC) route system between the United States and Japan and the route system between Hawaii and the west coast of the United States, within the Fukuoka, Oakland Oceanic and Anchorage Oceanic FIRs. It consists of a combination of at least 50 NM lateral and 1000 ft vertical separation. Composite separation is only applied between aircraft flying on parallel tracks within the composite route systems. If an aircraft crosses a composite route system then non-composite separation must be provided.
