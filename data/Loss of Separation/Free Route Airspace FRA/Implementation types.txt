Free route operations can be: Time limited (e.g. at night) – this is usually a transitional step that facilitates early implementation and allows field evaluation of the FRA while minimising the safety risks.. Structurally or geographically limited (e.g. restricting entry or exit points for certain traffic flows, applicable within CTAs or upper airspace only) – this could be done in complex airspaces where full implementation could have a negative impact on capacity.. Implemented in a Functional Airspace Block environment – a further stage in the implementation of FRA. The operators should treat the FAB as one large FIR.. Within SES airspace – this is the ultimate goal of FRA deployment in Europe..
