The implementation of FRA offers a number of efficiency benefits for the operators. There are also a number of challenges and issues but, overall, this is considered one of the most cost-effective changes to the ATS provision in Europe. The most notable benefits are: Reduced flight time, since most flights will be using the shortest routes possible;. Reduced CO2 emissions, as a consequence of the reduced flight time;. Reduced fuel waste, also a consequence of the reduced flight time and more optimal flight profiles;. Low implementation costs for ANSPs – in most cases implementation of FRA is supported by the existing ACC equipment;. Fewer conflicts – since the same number of aircraft are spread over more routes;. Weight optimisation – in general FRA reduces the difference in distance between the planned route and the actual route. This in turn reduces the amount of extra fuel that needs to be carried potentially allowing for a heavier payload..
