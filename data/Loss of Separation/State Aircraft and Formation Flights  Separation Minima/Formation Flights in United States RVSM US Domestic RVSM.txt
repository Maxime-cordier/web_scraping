With the implementation of domestic RVSM (DRVSM) within the U.S. National Airspace System, the FAA and Department of Defence (DoD) provided recommendations for improvements and changes to RVSM separation minima procedures. The recommendation to provide RVSM separation to formation flights including only RVSM compliant aircraft was accepted by FAA with Notice 7110.406 during May 2005. FAA argues that providing RVSM separation to formation flights comprised completely of RVSM compliant aircraft contributes to more efficient use of airspace and reduces the impact on air traffic controllers. (See Figure 2) A separation standard of 2,000 feet is applied above FL290 to all formation flights, which include an RVSM non-compliant aircraft.
