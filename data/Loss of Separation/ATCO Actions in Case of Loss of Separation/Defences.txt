It cannot be over-emphasised that each situation must be judged individually. It is not possible to give hard and fast collision avoidance guidance which is universally applicable. A controller is in a very difficult situation when faced with an immediate collision risk and must rely on both general and emergency orientated training when faced with such a scenario. As with any unusual or emergency situation, controllers should exercise their best judgment when dealing with the apparent consequences of loss of separation. The following list of actions is very general and is universaly accepted, but it is by no means exhaustive: Assess the situation. Provide adequate reaction. Speak clearly and use standard phraseology. Provide traffic information as appropriate. If an RA manoeuvre is reported and/or observed – do not attempt to modify the aircraft flight path until the pilot reports “Clear of Conflict”. Maintain constant situational awareness of other air traffic – when the problematic situtaion develops, it is a natural human tendency to narrow the attention and focus on the problem. Prioritise actions connected with other traffic as necessary.
