Consequences of the various possible outcomes of the hazards may be: a) Minor reduction of separation under control by controller or pilot; b) Minor reduction of separation with no control by controller nor pilot; c) Major reduction of separation under control by ATC or pilot; d) Major reduction in separation with no control by controller nor pilot; e) Accident. According to EUROCONTROL Safety and Regulatory Requirement â€“ Risk assessment and Mitigation in ATM (ESARR 4), transposed into Community Law by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2096/2005 (replaced by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1035/2011 of 17 October 2011) minor reduction in separation is less than half the separation minima.
