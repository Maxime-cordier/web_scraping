Despite the value of electronic means of conflict detection (e.g. ACAS and STCA) visual lookout remains an important defence against loss of separation for all classes of aircraft. This is particularly true for pilots of light aircraft, many of which are single-pilot operated, are not equipped with ACAS or transponders and frequently operate VFR outside ATC radar cover and at low altitude. It is essential that these pilots develop sound visual scanning techniques. This article is composed of extracts from the UK CAA Safety Sense Leaflet No 13 - 'Collision Avoidance' (see further reading). Although this article is directed towards pilots of light aircraft it is equally valid for all pilots, including those of large commercial aircraft.
