A provision in ICAO Annex 2 "Rules of the Air" requires that aircraft operating controlled flights shall, when on an established ATS route, operate along the defined centre line unless SLOPs are authorised on that route by the appropriate ATS authority, or directed by the appropriate air traffic control unit. The arrangements for the application of SLOPs are detailed in ICAO Doc 4444 PANS-ATM, ยง 15.2.4.
