One such example of the practical application of strategic lateral offset is the busy North Atlantic Ocean (NAT) track system, where flight crew have, since 2004, had the discretion to fly prescribed right hand offsets as generically described above whilst they remain within the oceanic area. The procedures currently detailed in Chapter 8.5 of the ICAO p NAT MPNS Airspace Operations Manual and NAT OPS Bulletin (see further reading), specify that all aircraft position reports shall be made by reference to the ATC-cleared track rather than actual co-ordinates if an offset is being flown and that only the centreline or offsets of up to 2nm (in 0.1 nm increments) right of the cleared track may be flown. The chosen offset (or centreline) track must be chosen tactically based upon a random approach subject to tactical considerations. Aircraft Operator procedures must not specify any of the three options for regular use unless an aircraft is without automatic offset programming capability in which case it must fly the centreline. Lateral Offset procedures, widely referred to as Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) are now a requirement for NAT airspace but must only be used within it. In practice, the theoretically ideal three way split between the centreline and the two prescribed offsets is not easily achieved, especially given that not all aircraft yet have automatic offset capability. UK ANSP NATS, which is one of the agencies involved in NAT ATS, has been routinely collecting data on offsets on behalf of ICAO since 2005, and its most recent data showed that 60% of traffic at longitude 30 degrees West was on the track centreline, 30% was offset at 1nm and the remaining 10% was offset at 2nm.
