Operational Air Traffic (OAT) have to perform activities that are fundamentally different than those done by General Air Traffic (GAT) and are not covered by ICAO SARPs. OAT missions include air-to-air refuelling, air combat maneuvring, etc. and the aircraft involved often have supersonic capabilities. There are two ways to ensure that (a) civil air traffic is safe and (b) operational traffic can effectively perform and train for their specific activities: Segregation. This would mean that special operations are conducted in reserved airspace (e.g. TSAs). The benefits of this approach are that it is safe and simple to implement. The disadvantages are that large portions of airspace need to be reserved for just a few aircraft and restrictions of civil traffic may need to be imposed. In congested airspace such as that over the EU this could cause severe disruption of civil flights (delays and cancellations).. Integration. This would mean that special procedures need to be designed in order to have both OAT and GAT flights at the same time in the same airspace. As a part of the effort, the EUROAT specifications were developed in the European Union. Their main objective is to ensure that OAT traffic is able to complete their specific tasks while maintaining the desired safety levels for civil aircraft..
