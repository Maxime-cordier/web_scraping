A number of safety issues arise during the handover-takeover process. Some of them are equipment-related while others are caused by human factors. The most notable of these are: insufficient information exchanged between controllers during a position swap (e.g. a controller is moving from an executive to a planner position, or the executive and planner controllers swap positions);. lack of a sufficient overlap time between arrival of the relieving controller and the departure of the relieved controller;. relieved controller in a hurry to leave or, relieving controller in a hurry to control;. handover is a social event, a moment when ATCOs exchange greetings and may be an opportunity to chat, so disturbing the formal transfer of traffic information;. lack of pre-briefing of the ATCOs;. lack of common team briefing and organization at the start of the shift;. adjustment of personal settings (usually done by the contoller) or system settings (usually done by the supervisor);. too many simultaneous handovers-takeovers (affecting several sectors);. the handover process affecting both controller positions;. the need to adjust the controller mindset to a new situation (e.g. a new sector or a new role)..
