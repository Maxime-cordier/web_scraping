Medium-Term Conflict Detection (MTCD) is a flight data processing system designed to warn the controller of potential conflict between flights in his area of responsibility in a time horizon extending up to 20 minutes ahead. MTCD is an integrated system of predictive tools performing the following functions: The detection and notification to the controller of probable loss of the required separation between two aircraft;. The detection and notification to the controller of aircraft penetrating segregated or otherwise restricted airspace;. The detection and display to the controller of aircraft-to-aircraft encounters where, although the required separation will be achieved, each aircraft is blocking airspace that might have been used by the other, e.g. In case of pilot request for an alternative level or when resolving a conflict involving one of the aircraft.. The term MTCD does not refer to a particular piece or collection of equipment, but to any system designed to achieve the above goals. Within Europe, MTCD was an important component of the First Air Traffic Control Support Tools Implementation (FASTI) programme. Launched in 2005, the FASTI programme supported the development and implementation of controller support tools at control centres across Europe and came to an end in April 2012. Another result of the programme was the development of the Tactical Controller Tool (TCT). This is a feature used as a short term (usually up to 8 minutes ahead) conflict detection and clearance verification tool.
