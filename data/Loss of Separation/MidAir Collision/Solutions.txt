Reductions in collision risk can be achieved by reducing the most important reasons why the individual barriers are unsuccessful, especially common-causes; improving beneficial influences that may make existing barriers more successful; and introducing new barriers, if this can be done without degrading the ones that are already there. As well as reducing collision risk, it is also desirable to maintain awareness of reasons why collision risks have been made as low as they are, so as to prevent deterioration in the future. Key areas with potential for improvement include: Improved positive Safety Culture. This includes improving crew/team resource management, air ground communications, compliance with ACAS warnings etc.. More extensive fitment of safety nets (STCA and ACAS). This includes developing STCA suitable for terminal areas.. Improved reliability and consistency of safety nets. These need to provide early and dependable warning, and to reduce nuisance alerts. This includes using information downlinked from the aircraft, providing this is sufficiently reliable to offset the extra hazard potential of common-cause failures.. Improved aircraft systems to alert pilots to any non-availability of transponders and ACAS.. Improved ATC systems and procedures to enhance conflict management during any degradation of surveillance or STCA.. Improved communications systems and procedures, such as controller-pilot datalink. This has the potential to reduce VHF congestion and communication errors, providing it is sufficiently reliable to offset the lost benefits of broadcast voice communication.. Improved predictability of aircraft trajectories, so that conflicts can be predicted and resolved at an earlier stage, using MTCD and similar systems, and ATCOs need to make fewer interventions to maintain separation..
