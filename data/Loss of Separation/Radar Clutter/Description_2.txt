there are other issues with similar effects (e.g. garbling and FRUIT), their impact on the controller's job is not as significant and they can be mitigated to a great extent. This is one of the reasons why in most parts of the world, transponder equippage and operation is mandatory in controlled airspace.. It should be noted that, depending on the purpose of the equipment, the clutter described above may be considered as useful signal, e.g.: For bird detecting radars, birds are not clutter. For weather radars, both ground and airborne, clouds and precipitation are not clutter. For the radio altimeter (which is based on the same principle of operation as the PSR), terrain is not clutter.
