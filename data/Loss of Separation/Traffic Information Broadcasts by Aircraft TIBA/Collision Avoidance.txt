Unless a potential conflict can be resolved in accordance with the standard right-of-way provisions and unless an alternative manoeuvre appears more appropriate, an immediate descent of 500 feet (or 1000 feet if above FL290 in an area where a 2000 feet vertical separation minimum applies) should be made with a broadcast to the other traffic of the action taken. A return to the pre-manoeuvre flight level should be made as soon as practicable. The action taken and the return to the pre-manoeuvre flight level should be advised to the appropriate ATS frequency and the display all available aircraft lighting which might improve the visual acquisition of the manoeuvring aircraft is recommended. Transponders should be operated as per ICAO PANS OPS Doc 8168, using Code 2000 even if outside radar coverage so that TCAS is enabled.
