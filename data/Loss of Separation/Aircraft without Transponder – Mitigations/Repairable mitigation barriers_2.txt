indications of transponder failures or malfunctions, if detected, should be given to the flight crew.. Regular scanning by ATCO - The controller should maintain an effective regular scan (e.g. to be able to detect non-alerted dropped tracks), rather than solely rely on “first contact” procedures. This also applies to detection of incorrect aircraft being given a clearance (due invalid correlation). There is some debate as to the effectiveness of this barrier, since in en-route controlled airspace, strip management is traditionally the primary means of deconfliction.. Use of primary radar data If available, this can be used to maintain a correlated track to support tactical conflict management in the event of a loss of secondary surveillance information. Note that this may be assisted by cooperation with the military, allowing the sharing of primary radar data.. Crew detection of transponder failure. Existing alerts are incorporated on most commercial aircraft, but may not be immediately noticeable in flight (e.g. Embraer Legacy-B737 accident in Brazil). Fail-safe indications of transponder failures or malfunctions, if detected, should be given to the flight crew..
