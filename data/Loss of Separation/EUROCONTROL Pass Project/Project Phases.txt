The project has been conducted in three phases: Phase 1 was a large scale monitoring study to understand the current operational situation in Europe and defined a typical series of events in STCA and ACAS occurrences. Three European ANPSs (DFS, DSNA, skyguide) participated in the monitoring phase of the project. Phases 2 and 3 developed performance and safety requirements for STCA, while Phase 3 has provided the core elements for a consistent overall concept for STCA and ACAS operations. With the evolution of SESAR, both Phases 2 and 3 became SESAR projects (within WP 4.8). The PASS study was led by Egis Avia (formerly Sofr√©avia) and conducted by a consortium of four organisations: DSNA/DTI, Deep Blue, QinetiQ and Egis Avia.
