Upon identification of the collision risk, TCAS II detection algorithms trigger calculation of coordinated avoidance manoeuvres for the affected aircraft. The device in each aircraft initially alerts the pilot by a simultaneous and direct flight instrument display and by aural annunciation of the respective RA. (The system generates RAs within one second of the detected conflict because one second is the “situation refresh” interval of TCAS II.) Coordination of the RAs essentially means requiring the pilot of Aircraft A to climb while requiring the pilot of Aircraft B, also at risk, to descend — or TCAS II could require the pilot of either aircraft to maintain an altitude. EUROCONTROL frequently reminds the aviation community that safe separation depends on the pilot of each aircraft promptly and accurately following (i.e., complying with) the initial RA. Therefore, whenever TCAS II generates an RA, the flight crew must comply — even if complying is contrary to the instructions received from the controller.
