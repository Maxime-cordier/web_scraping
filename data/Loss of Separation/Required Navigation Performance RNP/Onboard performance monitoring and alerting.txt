The on-board performance monitoring and alerting requirements for RNP 4, RNP 2, Advanced RNP, RNP 1 RNP APCH and RNP 0.3 have common terminology and application. Each of these RNP specifications includes requirements for the following characteristics: Accuracy: the accuracy requirement defines the 95% total system error (TSE) for those dimensions where an accuracy requirement is specified. The accuracy requirement is harmonised with the RNAV specifications and is always equal to the accuracy value. A unique aspect of the RNP specifications is that the accuracy is one of the performance characteristics that is monitored.. On-board performance monitoring: the aircraft, or aircraft and pilot in combination, is required to monitor the TSE, and to provide an alert if the accuracy requirement is not met or if the probability that the TSE exceeds two-times the accuracy value is larger than 10⁻⁵. To the extent operational procedures are used to satisfy this requirement, the crew procedure, equipment characteristics, and installation are evaluated for their effectiveness and equivalence.. Aircraft failures: failure of the aircraft equipment is considered within airworthiness regulations. Failures are categorised by the severity of the aircraft level effect, and the system must be designed to reduce the likelihood of the failure or mitigate its effect. Both malfunction (equipment operating but not providing appropriate output) and loss of function (equipment ceases to function) are addressed. Dual system requirements are determined based on operational continuity (e.g. oceanic and remote operations). The requirements on aircraft failure characteristics are not unique to RNP specifications.. Signal-in-space failures: Signal-in-space characteristics of navigation signals are the responsibility of the ANSPs..
