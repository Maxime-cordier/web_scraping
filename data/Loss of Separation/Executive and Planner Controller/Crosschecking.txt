Normally, each controller tries to monitor the other one's actions as much as possible. This is known as "the four-eye principle" and is somewhat similar to the PF/PM division of responsibilities. The goal is to prevent (or timely correct) errors or to otherwise improve the provision of service. For example, the PLN may detect lapses or errors in the EXE's clearances and the EXE may come up with a better plan or notice a situation that requires coordination with an adjacent sector that was not detected by the PLN. While such actions are not (and cannot formally be) a part of the controllers' duties, they often prove to be a good barrier against safety hazards.
