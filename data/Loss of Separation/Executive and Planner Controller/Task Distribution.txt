While being responsible for the same volume of airspace, the PLN and the EXE are doing different tasks. This division is described in detail in the local Manual of operations. While there are differences between ATS facilities, the following provides examples of typical duties that are generally used. The following is an (unexhaustive) list of the EXE's main responsibilities: Provide separation between aircraft. Follow the plan of the PLN (but has the option to discuss it and make changes). Perform communication with aircraft. Issue ATC clearances and instructions. Monitor all aircraft and make sure the clearances and instructions are complied with. Provide useful information to pilots. Inform the PLN of any significant (e.g. emergency or abnormal) situation that the PLN may not be aware of (due to e.g. being busy with a phone call), etc.. The following is an (unexhaustive) list of the PLN's main responsibilities: Identify safety risks (e.g. conflicts between aircraft, potential airspace infringement, etc.). Create a plan to resolve the situations (but the EXE has the option to discuss it and offer a different solution). Coordinate the entry and exit conditions to ensure smooth and orderly traffic flow. Coordinate any deviations from the standard procedures and letters of agreement with adjacent sectors. Inform the supervisor of any significant (e.g. emergency or abnormal) situation. Inform the adjacent sectors of any significant event (e.g. an emergency or abnormal situation that would affect them, a change of the frequency used, etc.). Coordinate with the appropriate authorities about operational air traffic. Coordinate the passage through (or the deactivation of) a special use area with its user. In addition to the above, interaction with the ATC system may be limited depending on the role. For example, some fields in the aircraft label or some windows may only be available to one of the controllers.
