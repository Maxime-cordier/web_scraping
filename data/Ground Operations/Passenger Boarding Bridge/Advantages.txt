The advantages of a Passenger Boarding Bridge over mobile boarding stairs are numerous. These include: Safety - passengers are not exposed to the numerous safety risks present on a busy ramp area. These include, but are not limited to, vehicle traffic, moving aircraft, prop wash and jet blast, and temperature and weather extremes. Security - requiring passengers to leave the airport terminal to walk to the aircraft also means that those passengers have been granted temporary access to a restricted area of the airport. Use of a PBB eliminates the potential security risks associated with passenger access to the ramp. Ease of Access - in most situations, use of a PBB eliminates the need for any stairs between the airport boarding gate and the aircraft. This greatly facilitates access for the elderly or infirm and negates the requirement for specialised ground handling equipment such as lift trucks to support wheel chair access. Reduced Manpower Requirement - the need to provide manpower for ramp supervision during passenger boarding/deplaning is eliminated. Boarding passes are inspected as passengers enter the PBB and from there, passengers move directly to the aircraft via a safe and secure environment. Passenger Comfort - the PBB is enclosed and often is also heated or cooled, as appropriate, ensuring that passengers are not exposed to precipitation or to extremes of temperature. Aircraft Ground Services - ground support services such as ground power and aircraft environmental control (heating/cooling) are often built into the PBB eliminating the need for mobile equipment.
