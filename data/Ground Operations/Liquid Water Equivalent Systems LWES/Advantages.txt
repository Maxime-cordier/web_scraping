Instead of using visibility to determine precipitation intensity, using the LWE rate eliminates the need for the flightcrew to determine different variables in selecting the correct information from the published HOT tables or to adjust the HOTs by combining information from different cells under some weather conditions. This results in the LWES producing a more accurate and useful measurement of fluid performance—expressed as a HOT or a CT—than does the use of paper HOT tables. This increased accuracy improves the safety of the operation and may provide a reduction in the use of deicing and anti-icing fluids, while giving flightcrews and flight operations supervisory activities better information on fluids protection. The improved accuracy of the provided fluid failure information also may allow departures in snow conditions which previously would have been restrictive using the visibility based precipitation rate of the paper HOT table.
