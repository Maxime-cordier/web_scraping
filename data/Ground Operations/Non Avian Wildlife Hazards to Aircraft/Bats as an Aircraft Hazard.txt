Given all the above information, especially the almost complete absence of daytime flight, it will be evident that bat strikes by aircraft are a relatively rare occurrence and unsurprising that strikes sufficient to directly cause an aircraft accident are so far unknown. Not only do bats fly mainly at night but the ones most likely to be encountered, the insectivorous bats, navigate by means of an ‘on-board radar system’ entirely analogous to primary radar and hibernate in winter when insect food supply diminishes. Fruit bats, whilst characterised by large communal roosts, use exclusively trees and caves rather than buildings for this purpose and transit at low level to and from their feeding sites of tree-borne fruit. This behaviour places most of them at an even lower risk of an aircraft impact than insectivorous bats.
