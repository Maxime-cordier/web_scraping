Much more so than with birds, the likelihood of an aircraft / mammal impact or near miss is extremely location-specific. Mammals have habitat and foraging requirements which are specific to species, and the runway areas of airports are generally open and treeless habitats which are unattractive to many larger animals because of their resultant vulnerability to visual detection by predators and humans. Although it is also the case that many mammal species are mainly active during the hours of darkness, aircraft manoeuvring areas are well lit by the lights ahead of moving aircraft and vehicles. Of course the natural habits of all animals can be, and are, modified by the perceived attractions of closer-than-normal association with human activity, especially the inevitable availability of edible waste in the vicinity of airport buildings. Such food supply may directly draw in animals which can constitute a direct hazard to aircraft or may indirectly attract larger predators which are themselves hazardous. In some parts of the world, some animal species undertake communal seasonal migrations similar to those made by birds and local awareness will be the only guide to any resultant increased hazard.
