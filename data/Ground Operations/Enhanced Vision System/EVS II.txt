EVS II is the next generation Enhanced Vision System (EVS) allowing for increased pilot visibility and flight safety during flight operations in darkness, smoke, haze, rain, fog, and other low visibility conditions. The EVS II, enhances a pilotâ€™s ability to safely fly an aircraft by providing increased flight visibility for improved situation awareness. EVS II allows a pilot to identify runway lights and ground features at night and under low visibility conditions by adjusting to current conditions in real time to maintain optimal detection capability. The enhanced flight visibility is provided in accordance with Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Enhanced Flight Vision Systems (EFVS) regulations. EVS II operation is based on advanced infrared (IR) sensor functionality, and works in conjunction with the aircraft Head Up Display (HUD) and head-down display. EVS II is installable in both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.
