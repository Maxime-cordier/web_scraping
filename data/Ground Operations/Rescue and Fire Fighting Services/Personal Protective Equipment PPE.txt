Burning fuels generate intense radiant heat. Firefighters wear a protective ensemble referred to as a 'fire proximity suit' that is coated with a silvered material designed to reflect heat away from their bodies. They must also wear self-contained breathing apparatus to provide a source of breathable air allowing them to work in an environment of smoke and other super-heated gases. This is especially critical when making entry into the burning cabin of an aircraft.
