The term Aircraft Ground Running is usually used to describe the operation of some or all of the engines of an aircraft, whilst on the ground, for the purpose of functionally checking the operation of either engines or aircraft systems. This usually takes place prior to the Release to Service of an aircraft from maintenance. Ground running may be carried out either prior to, during or after the rectification of a defect or scheduled work on an engine or an aircraft system, when this requires engines to be operating in order to assess its function. Although the aircraft may need to be taxied or towed to an approved ground running position under a clearance from ATC, most operators and maintenance organisations do not require pilots to be on board because aircraft technicians can be trained and approved for these duties.
