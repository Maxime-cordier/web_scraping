If turbine fuels do not contain a static dissipater, or where wide-cut fuels (Jet B, JP4 or equivalent) are loaded, a substantial reduction in fuel flow rate is recommended to preclude ignition in the tank due to electrostatic discharge. Wide-cut fuel is considered to be 'involved' when it is being supplied or when it is already present in the aircraft tanks. It is recommended that when wide-cut fuel has been used, the next two uplifts of fuel should be treated as though they too were wide-cut. Mixtures of wide-cut and kerosene turbine fuels can result in the air-fuel mixture in the tank being in the combustible range at common ambient temperatures during fuelling.
