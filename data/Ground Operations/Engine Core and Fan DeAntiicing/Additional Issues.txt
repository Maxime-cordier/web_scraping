Whilst aerodromes are generally well equipped to deal with airframe de-icing and anti-icing requirements, the availability of specialised engine de-icing equipment may be quite limited. When conditions that are conducive to the formation of engine core and fan blade icing exist, this deficiency can result in significant departure delays. These departure delays, in turn, may result in the requirement for the airport to restrict arrivals due to the oversaturation of the available parking stands and other aerodrome resources.
