at any specified interval or as otherwise recommended. Pilots of aircraft that require to run up engines to a certain RPM at regular intervals should consider aircraft behind them; all pilots should be prepared for higher than normal jet eflux from aircraft ahead.. Some engine types have a defined maximum ground exposure time to freezing rain or freezing fog due to core icing concerns. This time is cumulative and, if core de-icing procedures were not accomplished during a ground stop, the exposure time during the inbound taxi must be taken into consideration as part of the total exposure time. If the time limit is exceeded, the aircraft must return to the gate for engine core de-icing procedures.
