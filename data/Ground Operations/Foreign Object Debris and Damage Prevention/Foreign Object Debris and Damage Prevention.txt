Foreign object debris (FOD) at airports can cause damage that costs airlines, airports, and airport tenants millions of dollars every year. FOD includes any object found in an inappropriate location that - as a result of being in that location - can damage equipment or injure aircraft or airport personnel. The resulting damage has been estimated to cost the aerospace industry $4 billion a year. Airports, airlines, and airport tenants can reduce both this cost and the risk to safe flight that can result, by taking steps to prevent airport FOD. FOD includes a wide range of material, including loose hardware, pavement fragments, catering supplies, building materials, rocks, sand, pieces of luggage, and even wildlife, especially insects which can obstruct unprotected aircraft pitot tubes or static vents. FOD with potential to affect aircraft may be found at terminal gates, on cargo aprons, taxiways, runways, and in ground running areas. It can cause damage through direct contact with aircraft, such as by cutting aircraft tyres, by being ingested into aircraft engines, or as a result of being moved by jet blast or prop wash and impacting aircraft. Movement of FOD by jet blast or prop wash can also injure people. A FOD-prevention programme involving training, facility inspection, maintenance and coordination between all affected parties can minimise FOD and its effects.
