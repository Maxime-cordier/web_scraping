The exhaust of a running jet engine always creates an efflux/blast. In being aware of this risk, flight crews should always consider the following: Aircraft creating jet efflux/blast: Take special care in narrow cul de sacs. Do not apply more than the Flight Manual specified break away thrust (if known).. If break away thrust is not sufficient, advise ATC of needing to apply more thrust before simply applying it; they may be able to hold or divert traffic passing behind.. High thrust operations, for example a cross-bleed engine start, must only be carried out in specified locations and require specific approval from ATC before increasing thrust.. Aircraft at risk from jet efflux/blast: Be aware of the potential danger area behind large jet aircraft (large aircraft with two jet engines generally have greater installed thrust, and potentially longer hazard areas, than the 4-engine wide bodies).. Be aware of the increased risk potential when a large aircraft is moving off.. Consider remaining clear of the rear of any aircraft that you suspect may be using, or about to use, high power settings.. All Aircraft Be attentive to taxiway and runway conditions.. Report all loose surface material. Avoid high thrust as much as possible and especially if avoidance of loose surface material is impossible. A more detailed review of this hazard with examples can be found in the separate article "Applying Take-off Thrust On Unsuitable Pavement Surface May Have Hidden Dangers" (see Further Reading).
