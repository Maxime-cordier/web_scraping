On passenger aircraft, a record of which checked bags are stowed in which ULD is normally kept so that if it is necessary to retrieve a particular item prior to flight, it should be known which ULD it has been loaded in. On cargo aircraft, ULDs are often used in combination with netted pallets. In all cases, the aircraft hold must be equipped with a roller floor and the straps and fittings (accessories) necessary to secure the containers and/or pallets in position.
