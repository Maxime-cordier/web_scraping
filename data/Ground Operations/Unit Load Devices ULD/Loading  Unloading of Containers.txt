Always check the unit before starting loading. Any damage found must be below the required damage limits otherwise the ULD is not airworthy.. If the cargo is to be protected from possible rain damage by the use of plastic sheets, these should be taped inside the container. The use of plastic sheeting around the outside of the container is subject to restrictions: the material must meet FAA/ EASA burn rate requirements and the manufacturers plate (TSO Plate) must remain visible.. Cargo or bags should be stacked in an interlocking fashion as far as possible.. Avoid placing heavy cargo in the outboard section of the container (overhanging section) as this can cause the container to rock or tilt to the outside, causing loading difficulties.. Ensure that cargo/ baggage in the door side does not extend to the point that the door is not flat when closed.. Inspect the loaded ULD to ensure it is within the designated contour. It may appear that a container is within its contour by the nature of its structure, however there are extremely small clearances between the container and the cargo hold liner in many aircraft and even a small distortion in the container structure (as may occur due to certain types of damage, or from loading heavy cargo in the overhanging section of the container) can result in the container touching the hold walls, causing considerable damage and grounding the aircraft (hold liners are fire containment devices and if punctured the aircraft cannot take off). Care must be taken that all ULD are within their designated contour before they are loaded to the aircraft.. Consult airline guidance for any heavy items which may require spreader boards to spread the weight on the base and may require additional tie down using cargo straps.. When closing the door, do not use hammers or other excessive force to operate latches etc as these will almost certainly not be openable on arrival at destination.. Never use knives to cut open a container door.
