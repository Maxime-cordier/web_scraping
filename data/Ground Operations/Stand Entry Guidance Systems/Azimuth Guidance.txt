Azimuth guidance may be achieved simply by following a painted/lighted taxiway line or with the assistance of a marshaller. To allow monitoring, it is desirable that a marshaller stands where they can be seen by both pilots. Guidance may be provided by various forms of` left / right indications on an illuminated head-of-gate display. There are two basic types; the system may rely on optical alignment with the pilot’s eye, in which case it can only be used from the left hand seat, or sense the position of the aircraft and display guidance information that might be used by either pilot. Examples are as follows: AGNIS (Azimuth Guidance for Nose-In Stands) has two vertical, parallel light bars. Both appear green when the aircraft is on the stand centreline but, if it is displaced to the left or right, the light on that side turns red, inviting the pilot to turn towards the green light to regain the centreline.. APIS++ (Aircraft Parking and Information System) uses a laser system and displays an arrow like pattern that points in the direction to be steered together with closing rate and stopping guidance; a second display may be provided aligned with the right hand seat so the aircraft can be steered from either seat and allowing monitoring of lateral guidance and distance to go/closure rate by the Pilot Monitoring.. Safedock senses the aircraft position using a scanning laser; it not only provides guidance but can compare the characteristics of the detected aircraft with stored parameters to confirm that the aircraft is of the selected type, although the system cannot distinguish between aircraft types with similar profiles. An electronic display with arrow like pointers showing the direction to steer provides guidance. Because this does not depend on alignment with the pilot’s eye it can be used from either seat and allows monitoring..
