Procedures for ground staff for the activation of fully-automatic or semi-automatic SEG for arriving aircraft should require that the full marked gate area for aircraft use is clear of all obstructions, surface contamination and FOD. However, neither this nor the correct application of SEG activation procedures can be assumed. It is often difficult to establish if the gate area is clear from the flight deck, especially when it is dark. The aircraft commander (or other authorized person with clearance to conduct out of service aircraft ground re-positioning of an aircraft under its own power) has responsibility for the safety of the aircraft as it arrives at the gate. Prior to stand entry, the appropriate stand guidance system should be confirmed switched on and selected for the correct aircraft type. If this is not the case, the pilot should not attempt to “self-park” and should not enter the parking area until the stand guidance system has been switched on; partially entering the stand area before the SEG system is functioning may cause it to give erroneous information once it its available. ATC should be kept fully informed if the aircraft is unable to fully park for any reason. Many automatic and semi-automatic guidance systems are ‘calibrated’ for the pilot occupying the left hand seat only. When a marshaller is used, the marshaller usually assumes that the person steering the aircraft is seated in the left hand seat, so as the aircraft approaches the stop point the marshaller will move to the side to be visible to the person in the left hand seat. This is particularly relevant when parking wide-body aircraft.
