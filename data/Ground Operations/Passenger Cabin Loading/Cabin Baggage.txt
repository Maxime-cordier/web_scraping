Standard passenger weights also include an allowance for permitted cabin baggage. Restrictions on the maximum number of pieces, their maximum weight and/or their maximum dimensions are likely to be imposed by both the aircraft operator and the airport security screening process. This usually means that available stowage in overhead lockers or on the floor underneath the seat in front of that occupied will be sufficient. Any outsize items should only be permitted on board if they can be safely stowed using special wardrobe or locker space and by prior agreement of the senior cabin crew who may seek the authority of the aircraft commander if in doubt as to acceptance. Emergency Evacuation rules usually require that during take off and landing, passengers are not permitted to have items in their laps; additionally, items of baggage may not be placed under the seat in front of them if seated immediately to the rear of a fixed bulkhead or at an emergency exit row.
