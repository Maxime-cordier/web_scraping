The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is promoting its ‘IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operations’ ISAGO which aims to extend the IOSA concept to aircraft ground service provision in the belief that it will help raise overall safety standards amongst the large numbers of service providers involved. In addition, the IATA Ground Handling Partner Program is intended to help members address ground handling issues that impact safety and damage reduction, while promoting efficiency improvement initiatives. In late 2022, IATA called for a transition to "enhanced ground support equipment" or enhanced GSE as a way to improve safety and contain the cost of ground damage involving GSE. Enhanced GSE uses anti-collision, improves vehicle control, and increases docking accuracy, which reduces the risk of personnel injuries and damage to aircraft. A 2022 IATA study, IATA Ground Damage Report: The Case for Enhanced Ground Support Equipment, estimated that the cost of ground damage could nearly double toUS$10 billion per year by 2035 unless preventive action, like transitioning to enhanced GSE, was taken.
