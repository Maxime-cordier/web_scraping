One of the key requirements for the safe deployment of vehicles airside, on manoeuvring areas shared with aircraft, is that their drivers (or their front seat colleagues) are competent in RTF communication with ATC. Airport Authorities usually have overall responsibility for setting and monitoring standards, but the agency operating a vehicle has direct responsibility for ensuring that ATC communications with their vehicle is of a standard which will preclude any contribution to diminished safety standards for aircraft. Whilst some vehicles will be operated directly by the airport authority, most will be operated by various service providers. The chance of disaster is at its greatest when the possibility exists of an aircraft at speed on a runway, during the take off or landing roll, encountering ground vehicles. One national survey showed that in 2007, 26% of recorded runway incursion incidents involved vehicles and the majority were not unintended errors by ATC but unintended errors by vehicle drivers.
