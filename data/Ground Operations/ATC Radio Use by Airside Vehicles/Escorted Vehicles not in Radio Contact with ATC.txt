If appropriate procedures have been agreed with ATC, it may be permissible for a radio equipped vehicle driven by a suitably authorised permit holder to escort a visiting vehicle within the ATC-controlled zone. Such arrangements carry a heavy responsibility upon the escorting driver to ensure that the driver of the escorted vehicle has been properly briefed and to monitor the position of the other vehicle at all times to ensure both vehicles comply with ATC clearances. This particularly applies to position reports which will need to be made only when the whole ‘convoy’ is in compliance.
