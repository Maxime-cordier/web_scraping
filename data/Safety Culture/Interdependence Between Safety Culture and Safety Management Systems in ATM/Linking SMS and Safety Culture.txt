The safety health of any organisation is the product of two key elements: The quality and execution of the systems and processes implemented to deal with risk and safety-related information (the Safety Management System, which may or may not be formalised), and. The Safety Culture, which includes people's shared values, beliefs and attitudes about safety.. These two elements combine to characterise the way that people behave within their organisation, the 'behavioural norms'. (See Figure 1) Figure 1 - Interdependence between SMS and Safety Culture in an organisation. Therefore SMS and Safety Culture are interdependent with the SMS embodying the competence to achieve safety, and Safety Culture representing the commitment to achieve safety. The outcome of these features is an adequate cognisance, referring to the organisation’s correct awareness and understanding of the threats to its operations, which in turn shapes behaviours towards safety.
