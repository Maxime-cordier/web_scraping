Safety management implies a systematic approach to managing safety, including the necessary organisational structure, competencies, accountabilities, policies and procedures. It is recognised that the existence of an appropriate and comprehensive Safety Management System (SMS) is necessary for maintaining and improving the safety of ATM operations. However, it may not be sufficient to guarantee adequate safety performance.
