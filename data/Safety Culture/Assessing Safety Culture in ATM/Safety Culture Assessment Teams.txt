A collaboration between ANSP members and an independent Safety Culture assessment team (compiled of external experts) is desirable for collecting pertinent information, analysing the findings, and drawing conclusions for planning and implementing improvements to the existing Safety Culture. An external Safety Culture assessment team is useful for: contributing an ‘outsider’ perspective. It is often easier for ‘outsiders’ rather than ‘insiders’ to identify subtle but important aspects of organisational culture, investigate the values and beliefs underlying day-to-day behaviours, appreciate past and present culture, and challenge individual and organisational safety behaviours. providing the expertise and experience necessary for conducting an effective Safety Culture assessment process, identifying Safety Culture strengths and weaknesses and working with ANSPs to investigate a way ahead.. The external expertise is frequently represented by an assessment team rather than a single expert to avoid, as far as possible, any bias or individual subjectivity. The contribution of ANSP personnel is essential for: providing the ‘inside’ information to measure the organisation’s Safety Culture (e.g., opinions and experiences on risk awareness, safety behaviour and commitment to and involvement in safety). assisting the Safety Culture assessment team in data collection and validation (e.g., providing access to information and workshop participants). establishing a viable way ahead. ensuring ‘ownership’ by the ANSP of the process, findings and outcomes..
