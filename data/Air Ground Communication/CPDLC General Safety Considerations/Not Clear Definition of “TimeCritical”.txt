Background: CPDLC is only to be used in non-time-critical situations. Safety issue(s): There is no strict definition of “time-critical”. Different people may interpret this matter differently. Also, depending on the circumstances, a situation may unexpectedly become time critical. Defences: Controller’s instructions usually contain some time reserve to account for the pilot’s response and the transitional period of the instruction execution (e.g. the increase of the vertical speed from 0 to the assigned one). The reserve has to be extended, if practicable, with the response lag of CPDLC, or, if this seems infeasible, voice should be considered. In the above example: The instruction for descent is issued about 4 minutes before the separation falls to 8NM. There is one minute reserve (the pilot is supposed to achieve the desired rate of descent within this period) and the time necessary to reach FL290 is three minutes. The pilot is usually supposed to respond to a CPDLC instruction within two minutes. The descent rate that ensures the separation with BTD987 is 6000ft/min which is obviously unfeasible. The instruction would be safe, however, if uplinked 6 minutes before the moment when the separation is 8NM.
