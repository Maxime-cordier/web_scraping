Background: With CPDLC it is possible that an aircraft is using voice to communicate with one ATS unit (or sector) while being CPDLC connected to another. Safety issue(s): Two controllers form different sectors being able to issue (contradicting) clearances to the same aircraft may lead to misunderstanding, increased workload for all parties concerned and sometimes to loss of separation. Defences: ATS procedures may restrict the use of CPDLC by ATCOs (e.g. even if technically possible, CPDLC should not be used before initial contact by voice is made or after the transferring process has commenced).
