Pilots must read back the safety related part of all communications. ATCOs must listen carefully to the read-back and correct any factual error or any apparent misunderstanding. If there is any doubt in the minds of flight crew as to the precise content of a clearance, or there is any doubt about how to comply (for example the identity or location of a waypoint) then they should request a repeat of either the clearance or a specific part of it that was not understood by the request 'Say again'.
