Findings from incident and accident reports, as well as common sense, have been used to determine the following recommendations: Whenever possible, the GND controller should issue standard taxi route instructions using standard RTF.. The use of electronic coordination reduces the risk of being unable to pass information due to the addressee being busy.. A separate warning sign for each vehicle or aircraft that enters or crosses a runway is helpful in preventing runway incursions.. Coordination procedures should be described in as much detail as possible.. Strict adherence to procedures is advisable for both controllers even when it seems that the situation is under control and nothing could go wrong.. When the situation changes (e.g. when an inactive runway becomes active) the controllers should check all existing clearances and instructions with respect of the new conditions. Appropriate tool/software can help with this task.. The GND controller should be made aware of a runway becoming active well in advance so that they can check the clearances and instructions issued.. Both TWR and GND controllers should have clear lines of responsibility and should not extend their actions beyond these lines (e.g. they should avoid delegating own responsibility to the corresponding TWR/GND unit as often relevant information may be omitted due to shift changes etc.).
