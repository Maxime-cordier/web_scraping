Unless a message is copied correctly, its content may be misunderstood or not correctly acted upon. A message which is received at a time of high pilot workload may disrupt a sequence of actions being followed such as a check-list and one or more items may then be missed when it is resumed. The necessity to repeat an incompletely copied or understood message can take time better used on other matters.
