Control the speed of all transmissions to reduce the chances of pilot or controller error.. ATCOs may not be able to avoid passing or revising clearances during periods of high workload; however, by appreciating when these are most likely, by passing on clearances as early as possible and by carefully monitoring read-back, they can reduce the likliehood of flight crew errors.. Passing the initiative to the flight crew ("Copy (clearance/weather info/etc.) when ready") could be considered if the ATCO workload is not excessive and the controller is unsure of the proper timing but suspects high crew workload.. Avoid multiple frequency changes during high workload periods following take-off and during the departure.. More strategically, it may be possible to take account of flight deck workload issues when designing or revising ATM procedures..
