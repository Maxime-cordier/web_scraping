Even in non-ATC use, SATCOM voice communications still require standard radio discipline procedures. Any attempt to use a SATCOM link like a normal telephone can easily lead to misunderstandings. Satellite Voice-equipped aircraft can initiate calls using either INMARSAT or IRIDIUM assigned security phone numbers (ICAO short codes), or can direct dial using commercial phone numbers and country codes. Ground Earth Stations can originate calls to SATCOM Voice-equipped aircraft using their unique 8-digit Aeronautical Earth Station (AES), aircraft ID (OCTAL) code, or phone number.
