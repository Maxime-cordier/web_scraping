Introduction of satellite-based data link services for en route ATM, both for CPDLC and for surveillance, has allowed suitably equipped ANSPs to trial reduced oceanic procedural separation standards such as 50 nm longitudinal and 30nm longitudinal/30nm lateral. However, inconsistent data link performance mainly attributed to a combination of satellite outages, and poor Ground Earth Station (GES) availability and data link capacity issues, have temporarily reduced confidence in some early applications. Satellite providers have since worked together to address these concerns and have identified infrastructure solutions which States are being asked to help implement.
