The process of changing frequency offers many possibilities for communication failure if the pilot subsequently selects the wrong frequency. Frequency change occurrences are often of short duration because the pilot realises on checking in that he/she is on the wrong frequency: either the frequency is silent, in which case the pilot returns to the previous frequency, or it is active, in which case the controller directs the pilot to the correct frequency. Frequency change incidents can have serious consequences if the pilot is unable to re-establish contact quickly. This might occur if the previous frequency is very busy, or if the aircraft is out of range of the previous controlling station. Frequency change occurrences often happen in areas of high density air traffic, especially during climb and descent, where many frequency changes are required as the aircraft is passed from one agency to another. Since these occasions coincide with periods of high pilot work-load, there is an enhanced likelihood that an error in copying the frequency or in setting it correctly will go undetected. Frequency change errors are equally common in low-workload situations, perhaps because the pilots are more relaxed, or concentrating on some routine issue. Moreover, it may take longer to detect loss of communication than when working a busy frequency.
