Take-off without ATC Clearance is an aerodrome-related safety event that is somewhat similar to Landing without ATC Clearance. Both involve air traffic control, typically happen during critical and high-workload stages of the flight, and can result in similar hazardous outcomes (e.g. runway incursion, loss of separation, collision, etc.). The main difference between the two events (aside from the flight phase) are the causal factors involved. Landing without ATC clearance can be caused by one or more of a variety of factors - loss of communication, loss of situational awareness (e.g. unintentional use of an incorrect runway, taxiway or even aerodrome), poor communication, high workload, etc. In the takeoff without ATC clearance scenario, poor pilot-controller communication (e.g. improper phraseology) is by far the most common precursor. Normally, if a flight crew finds out that there is a communication failure during the taxi phase, they will return to apron to investigate and will not attempt to take off. Also, while the inadvertent use of a wrong runway (or a taxiway) for take off sometimes happens, it is impossible to imagine that a pilot would try to use a wrong aerodrome. Note: this article does not examine scenarios in which a valid takeoff clearance is given but is not followed correctly due to the aircraft being in the wrong place (i.e., attempting takeoff from a taxiway or from a wrong runway).
