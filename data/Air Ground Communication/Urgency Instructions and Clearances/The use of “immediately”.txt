The words “immediate” or “immediately” may be used: When clearing an aircraft for an immediate departure. When cancelling a take-off clearance in conjunction with the word "Stop". When a pilot is given a lateral or vertical clearance as avoiding action in respect of potential traffic conflict. The use of “immediately” is always associated with urgency due to a situation which is or may become hazardous to safety. Both ICAO Doc 9432 and UK CAA CAP 413 recommend using the word “immediately” in conjunction with the phrase “due traffic” when instant action is required by a pilot. It clearly communicates the reason without giving unnecessary additional detail. The pilot is expected to comply as quickly as possible. Due to the urgency of the situation the controller may explain the reasons for the instruction after the safety issue has been resolved.
