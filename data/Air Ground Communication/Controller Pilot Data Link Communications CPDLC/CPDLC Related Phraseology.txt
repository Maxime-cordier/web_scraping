When voice communication is used to correct a CPDLC message the following phrase is used:. (call sign) DISREGARD CPDLC (message content or type) MESSAGE, BREAK, (corrected message). Example: BTD123 DISREGARD CPDLC CLIMB MESSAGE, BREAK, CLIMB FLIGHT LEVEL 310. When receiving an alert for a single CPDLC message failure, the controller or pilot either confirms via voice the actions that will be undertaken with respect to the related dialogue, prefacing the information with the phrase '“CPDLC MESSAGE FAILURE” or uses CPDLC to reissue the message that failed.. When receiving an alert that CPDLC has failed the controller or pilot should revert to voice, and inform the other side using the phrase “CPDLC FAILURE”.. In case of a complete CPDLC ground system failure the controller should use a general call: ALL STATIONS CPDLC FAILURE (unit name).. When a controller requires all stations or a specific flight to avoid sending CPDLC requests for a limited period of time, the following phrase shall be used: ((call sign) or ALL STATIONS) STOP SENDING CPDLC REQUESTS [UNTIL ADVISED] [(reason)]. The resumption of the normal use of CPDLC shall be advised by using the following phrase: ((call sign) or ALL STATIONS) RESUME NORMAL CPDLC OPERATIONS.
