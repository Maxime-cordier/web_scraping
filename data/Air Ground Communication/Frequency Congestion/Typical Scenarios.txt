The pilot, who is awaiting a clearance, takes a clearance intended for another aircraft. The ATCO does not notice the error on read back.. The pilot takes a frequency change intended for another aircraft, resulting in loss of communication.. In his/her attempt to pass the message quickly, the ATCO does not use standard phraseology; this increases the chance of communication breakdown.. The pilot transmits at the same time as another, who is conducting communications in the local language. This results in a blocked transmission.. Radio Interference makes it difficult to read the call sign in a transmission, which is mistakenly taken by the wrong pilot..
