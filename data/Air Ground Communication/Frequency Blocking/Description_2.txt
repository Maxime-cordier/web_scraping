it, there are occasions where a pilot presses the transmit key as soon as they change the frequency. This may cause an overlap with someone who is already transmitting.. Coincidence. Sometimes even if the two operators listen out before transmitting, it is possible that they press their buttons at precisely the same moment. The probability of such an event increases in busier environments.. Callsign confusion. Sometimes messages by air traffic controllers are considered relevant by more than one flight crew. This usually (but not always) happens due to callsign similarity (e.g. PRE078 and PRE778). The result is that both pilots reply and block the frequency.. A frequency blocking may lead to: Inability to communicate. If the frequency is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, some stations may be unreachable on the frequency.. Aggravation of frequency congestion due to the need to repeat messages.. Misunderstandings due to the reluctance to ask for repetition. Sometimes, in a busy environment, operators will be "almost" sure about what they heard in a garbled message and would not ask for confirmation in order to not overload the frequency further.. Undetected blocking may lead to aircraft accepting a clearance intended for another one with the controller being unaware of the situation..
