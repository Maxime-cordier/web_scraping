The aircraft system sends specific aircraft data in different groups of an ADS-C report. Each group contains different types of data. An ADS-C event report contains only some of the groups, which are fixed. The ADS-C periodic report can contain any of the ADS-C groups, which the ATSU specifies in the contract request. The ADS-C report groups consist ot: Basic group. Flight identification group. Earth reference group. Air reference group. Airframe identification group. Meteorological group. Predicted route group. Fixed projected intent group. Intermediate projected intent group. The ATSU may use an ADS-C report for a variety of purposes. These include: Establishing and monitoring of traditional time-based separation minima;. Establishing and monitoring of distance-based separation standards;. Flagging waypoints as ‘overflown’;. Updating estimates for downstream waypoints;. Route and level conformance monitoring;. Updating the display of the ADS-C position symbol, and the associated extrapolation;. Generating (and clearing) alerts;. Generating (and clearing) ADS-C emergencies;. Updating meteorological information; and. Updating other information in the flight plan held by the ATSU.. For more detailed information on ADS-C principles of operation, capabilities and merits see the ICAO Global Operational Data Link Document (in Further Reading), Section 2.2.6.
