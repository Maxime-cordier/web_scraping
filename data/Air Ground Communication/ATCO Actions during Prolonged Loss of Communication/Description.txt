Communication between air traffic controllers and pilots continues to be an essential part of air traffic control operations and communication-related problems can lead to hazardous situations. Loss of communication between an aircraft and ATC can occur for various reasons, some could be technical and others attributable to the human factor element, for example due to inadvertent mismanagement of the human-machine interface. The duration of any loss of communication can vary greatly. The description Prolonged Loss Of Communication (PLOC) has yet to be officially defined but it is usually applied to a period of loss of communication in excess of 10 minutes. However, the absolute time before any loss of communication is so defined often depends on the airspace within which it takes place.
