When ADREP reports are received from States, the information is first checked and then stored in a computer. The stored reports constitute a data bank of world-wide occurrences to provide States with the following services: a) a bi-monthly summary of reports received, providing States with an up-to-date picture of significant occurrences on a world-wide basis, as well as with an opportunity to check their reports as processed by ICAO. b) annual ADREP statistics, presenting statistical information under broad categories such as the types of events which took place and the phases of operation in which they occurred; and c) replies to States’ requests for specific information in the form of an “ADREP Information Request”. The ICAO Accident/Incident Reporting Manual (ICAO Doc 9176) gives full details on how reports are complied and transmitted to ICAO. The basic means of reporting is a manual system using forms and formats described in Doc 9176. However, technological advances now mean that electronic means of reporting to ICAO are now available.
