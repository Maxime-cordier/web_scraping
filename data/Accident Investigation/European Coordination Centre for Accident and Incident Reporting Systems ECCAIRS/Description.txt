The ECCAIRS mission is to aid national and European transport entities in the collection, sharing and analysis of safety information in order to improve public transport safety. ECCAIRS relies on a specially designed software suite, called the ECCAIRS Reporting System, that allows European Union member states to collect data in the same manner and to share the information. Beginning with a suite that was first released in 1998, the system originally focused on collecting, sharing and analyzing safety information related to aviation. Since then, the system has been updated, including a 2011 enhancement – the fifth generation or ECCAIRS 5 -- that has also been used in gathering safety information from railway and maritime operations. EU member state safety information is held in two central databases: the European Central Repositories for Occurrences (ECR-ECCAIRS) and the European Central Repository for Safety Recommendations (ECR-SRIS), both located in the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre.
