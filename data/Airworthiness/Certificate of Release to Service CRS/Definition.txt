A Certificate of Release to Service (CRS) is a declaration made by appropriately authorised personnel once it has been verified that task being signed for has been properly carried out. Such a declaration is NOT a statement of airworthiness of the aircraft â€“ the obligation for airworthiness sits with the owner/operator.
