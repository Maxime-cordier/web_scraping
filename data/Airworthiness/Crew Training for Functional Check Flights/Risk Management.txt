The operating crew and any other personnel legitimately on the flight deck for an airworthiness function / check flight are the final line of defence in risk management, where the principal risk is loss of control. Useful background perspective on the importance of employing suitably trained flight crew on such flights is contained in the official Reports of two Accident / Serious Incident Investigations. See: B737, manoeuvring, west of Norwich UK 2009 - A Serious Incident involving loss of control to a Boeing 737 being operated by UK airline Easyjet whilst on an airworthiness function flight required by lessor handback procedures in 2009. A320, vicinity Perpignan France, 2008 - A fatal accident to an Airbus A320 being operated by XL Airways Germany following loss of control during an airworthiness check flight following repainting in preparation for lessor handback in 2008.
