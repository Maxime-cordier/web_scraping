The Certificate of Airworthiness (C of A) or Airworthiness Certificate is the formal document issued by the National Aviation Authority (NAA) to certify that an aircraft is airworthy. Every individual aircraft has to gain its own C of A which is achieved when it can be shown to conform to the certificated Type Design and is in a condition for safe operation. As a general rule civil aircraft are not allowed to fly unless they have a valid C of A. Depending upon the regulatory regime, the C of A will need either periodic re-validation or periodic renewal which may involve the completion of a flight test schedule. In USA, this is explained in FAR Part 21 Subpart H - Airworthiness Certificates. In the EU, member states must use non-expiring C of A (EASA Form 25), as described in EASA Part 21 Subpart H. This non-expiring C of A is validated by issuing of Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC), EASA Form 15a. The work to perform this review is carried out by the relevant Continuing Airworthiness Management Organization (CAMO) working on behalf of the operator.
