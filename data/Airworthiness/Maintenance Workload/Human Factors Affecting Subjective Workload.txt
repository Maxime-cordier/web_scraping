Many factors affect a person’s workload capacity, including: level of experience, knowledge and skill. familiarity and level of confidence. workspace design – does the “lay-out” and access to tools, equipment, documents and support, help or hinder the worker, and does it offer adequate protection. levels of fatigue and stress. health issues. sleep debt. circadian cycle – usually the early hours correspond with a lowered capacity. off-duty activities – it is common for shift workers to hold second jobs. Because some of these factors are personal and subjective, and therefore cannot be measured, it is important that to gain useful feedback and reduce risk, organisations support workers in self-assessment and self-reporting.
