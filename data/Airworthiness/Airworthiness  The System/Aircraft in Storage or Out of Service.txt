When aircraft are out of service and stored for any reason it becomes necessary to apply a preventative maintenance regime. This is laid down in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) not the normal Maintenance Programme. Specific requirements will vary for such reasons as: Length of time that the aircraft is not flown.. Environment in which it is stored e.g. in a dry desert environment compared to a moist sea air one.. The degree to which the aircraft is prepared before it is put into storage. For example if engines are removed, this will negate the need to operate them periodically. If the passenger seats and other furnishings are removed that too will reduce the amount of preventive work.. The installation of humidity reduction equipment will have a very positive effect on the aircraftâ€™s internal structure.. Notwithstanding the preparations, the need to provide proper care during storage cannot be overstated. The cost and attendant down time to restore the aircraft to service will be increased considerably if less than rigorous storage procedures are permitted.
