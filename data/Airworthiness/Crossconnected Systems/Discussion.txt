Preventing cross connected systems is a challenge in aviation maintenance. When two systems or system components that are not designed to be connected are connected, the risk of an adverse occurrence is increased. The most effective means to reduce the risk of a cross connection is to have and use accurate and clear information on system connections in maintenance manuals and to insure strict adherence to these procedures by maintenance personnel. There are several other interventions that can be used to eliminate, or at least minimise the possibility of a system cross connection. Hard Fix: One way to prevent a cross connection is to make it physically impossible for systems or system components to be cross connected. This can be done by making system connectors with a different size or type of connection that cannot be physically connected to another system or system component.. Soft Fix: This is the most common way of preventing cross connections. The maintenance manuals and procedures that address system connections should clearly depict the correct connection procedure, and should also provide specific cautions against any potential cross connection possibilities. Another soft fix is to color code connections so that only identical color connections are the correct ones.. Technical Fix: Another method to reduce the potential risk of a cross connection is to ensure that systems have some sort of built in test (BIT) capability that can be used to verify that all connections are correct..
