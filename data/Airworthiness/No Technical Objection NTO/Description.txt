No technical objections (NTO) are normally used in the context of the approval process of flight conditions for the likes of flight extensions and ferry flights. An NTO is generally issued by the type certificate (TC) holder to support the ferry of an aircraft to a base where a certain defect can be rectified or to permit the extension of the due date for a scheduled task or activity. NTOs are not considered as ‘acceptable technical data’ by airworthiness authorities who will not issue changes, repairs, flight permits, waivers etc based on NTO letters. For the airworthiness authorities a NTO letter issued by a TC holder assumes that the relevant engineering branches of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) have made a risk assessment on a particular damage or a deferred maintenance item and have sent out an official opinion on criticality. NTOs that are without the signature of a responsible engineer behind the documentation and without a risk assessment from the OEM side are not accepted.
