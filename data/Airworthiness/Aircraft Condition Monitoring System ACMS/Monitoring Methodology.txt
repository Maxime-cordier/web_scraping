CM is a maintenance strategy that monitors the actual condition of an asset to decide what maintenance needs to be done. CM dictates that maintenance should only be performed when certain indicators show signs of decreasing performance or upcoming failure. In the aircraft context, there are also time limited components and an established periodic maintenance cycle. An ACMS provides and additional level of safety by providing advance warning that there are indications of a potential failure. An ACMS is most typically installed at the time of manufacture as retrofitting the necessary sensors, wiring and data collection equipment is a difficult, time consuming, and expensive process. With the ACMS units in place and all monitored components calibrated and performing to manufacturer specifications, baseline values for vibration, temperature, pressure, rotational speed, and other measured parameters, are established. Once in service, condition data is gathered either at specified intervals, or continuously, depending upon the parameter being measured and the type of sensor associated. In the specified interval case, an exceedance of a pre-defined limitation will typically result in an additional data point being recorded. All of this data is used to monitor parameter "creep" (movement away from baseline values indicating wear or degradation) and tolerance exceedances (values that are beyond predefined thresholds), both which can indicate an increase in failure potential and the requirement for maintenance intervention.
