There are a number of advantages to an ACMS, the most obvious of which is enhanced safety. Detecting and addressing a pending failure can prevent the potential damage and the associated safety risk of a catastrophic failure. Other advantages include: Improving dispatch reliability. Reducing the potential for collateral damage to the aircraft caused by a catastrophic failure. Minimising unscheduled downtime due to catastrophic failure. Minimising operational impact by being able to plan the maintenance activities. Minimising maintenance overtime costs by being able to schedule the repair/component replacement. Reducing the requirement to inventory emergency spare parts.
