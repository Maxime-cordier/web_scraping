International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards address the need for passengers to receive safety information while aboard aircraft. Operators should communicate specific, accurate information and instructions to passengers, in a variety of methods, to facilitate understanding. These methods include verbal briefings and visual safety information, such as passenger safety briefing cards. ICAO guidance on passenger safety briefings, safety briefing cards, information signs, markings and placards, and other related topics can be found in the Manual on Information and Instructions for Passenger Safety (Doc 10086). The Manual was developed by ICAO to provide guidance on provisions contained in Annex 6, Operation of Aircraft. State regulators also provide information on what is required in passenger safety information briefings and cards. For example, U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular (AC) 121-24D, Passenger Safety Information Briefing and Briefing Cards, provides information on what is required to be covered in oral briefings and on briefing cards based on what is required by U.S. federal law.
