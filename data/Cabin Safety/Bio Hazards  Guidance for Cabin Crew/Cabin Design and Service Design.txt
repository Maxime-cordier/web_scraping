The design of the aircraft cabin environment and the service operated within the cabin should, as far as reasonably practicable, reduce the potential for biohazards arising. Consideration should be given to the type of work surfaces particularly in food preparation areas both in terms of resistance to contamination and ease of cleaning. It is recognised that on some aircraft types, passengers leaving toilet facilities rejoin the cabin through the galley. This provides an ideal opportunity for cross contamination of surfaces as passengers move about the aircraft. Systems of work should be in place to mitigate this potential contamination.
