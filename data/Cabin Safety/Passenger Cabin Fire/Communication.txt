Communication with the flight crew is very important since the captain will need to make a judgment as to whether to continue the flight to destination, land at the nearest suitable airport, or, in extreme circumstances, where the aircraft may soon become uncontrollable, land off-airfield. Security Considerations Communication between flight crew and cabin crew has been made all the more difficult by the security requirement to keep the flight deck door closed. The captain might consider it appropriate for one of the pilots, especially if there is a third pilot/second officer, to go into the cabin in order to assess the situation. If so, security procedures should be strictly adhered to as it is possible the fire was started by someone deliberately to gain access to the flight deck. Furthermore, in a smoke and fumes situation, keeping the flight deck door closed can reduce the amount of smoke on the flight deck.
