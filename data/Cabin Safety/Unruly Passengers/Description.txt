Annex 17 to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Chicago Convention (Convention on International Civil Aviation Security Safeguarding International Civil Aviation Against Acts of Unlawful Interference) defines a disruptive passenger as: "A passenger who fails to respect the rules of conduct at an airport or on board an aircraft or to follow the instructions of the airport staff or crew members and thereby disturbs the good order and discipline at an airport or on board the aircraft." The Tokyo Convention (1963), also known as The Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, makes it unlawful to commit “Acts which, whether or not they are offences [against the penal law of a State], may or do jeopardize the safety of the aircraft or of persons or property therein or which jeopardize good order and discipline on board.” Safety and security are considered the airline industry’s top priorities. However, disruptive passengers have, over the past several years, become more prevalent and unruly passenger incidents are currently a very real and serious threat to both safety and security. In 2020 and 2021, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began seeing what it described as "a disturbing increase in incidents where airline passengers have disrupted flights with threatening or violent behaviour." on 13 Jan. 21, the FAA admninstrator signed an order directing a stricter legal enforcement policy against unruly airline passengers. In extreme cases, the FAA has levied significant civil penalties against unruly passengers.
