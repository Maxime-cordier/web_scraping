The following general emergency evacuation guidelines for passenger and crew emergency egress are valid for both evacuations on land and on water: In a ditching situation, more than one impact should be expected. Evacuation should not be initiated until the aircraft has come to a complete stop. The engines must be shut down before opening door directly forward or aft of an engine. Cabin crewmembers should begin evacuation immediately upon signal from the flight deck crew. Cabin crew should follow any additional instructions the flight deck crew may give. If there is an emergency that the flight crew may not be aware of and time permits, the cabin crew should notify the flight deck prior to initiating an evacuation; if time does not permit, the notification of the flight deck should be done simultaneously upon commencement of evacuation. Cabin crew should make an independent decision to initiate an evacuation when there is severe structural damage, a life-threatening situation (fire, smoke, impact forces, ditching) or abnormal aircraft attitude exists and there is no response from the flight deck crew. If one cabin crewmember initiates an evacuation, all cabin crewmembers should follow evacuation procedures immediately. When a crewmember’s life is directly and imminently in danger, the cabin crewmember’s personal safety should always take priority.
