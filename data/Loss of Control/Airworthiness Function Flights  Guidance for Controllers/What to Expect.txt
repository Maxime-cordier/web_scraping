The following profiles are to be anticipated for aircraft undertaking airworthiness function flights: Requests to use blocks of altitude rather than fixed flight levels;. Non-standard route (orbiting, zigzagging, etc.);. Steeper climb and descent than is typical for the aircraft type;. Requests for navigational assistance (vectoring) to release the crew from the navigation workload;. Various types of equipment failures, intentional flight system/components deactivation due testing, are much more likely to occur than during scheduled flights..
