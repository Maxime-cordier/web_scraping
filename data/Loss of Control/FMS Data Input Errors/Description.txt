The Flight Management System (FMS) has evolved from a simple navigation management device into a fully integrated aircraft management system, receiving inputs from sensors in all flight critical systems and providing outputs that control virtually every aspect of the aircraftâ€™s behavior. The FMS has delivered efficiencies in aircraft management that are far beyond the capabilities of the human pilots. However, some data required by the FMS must still rely upon the human to obtain and enter by its variety of interfaces. It is within these interactions that errors, some with catastrophic results, can occur. The use of erroneous take-off parameters (thrust and speeds), usually as a result of using incorrect values for take off weight in performance calculations, can result in early rotation with tail strike, loss of control when airborne, or overrun as a result of failure to get airborne. Incorrect flight route inputs during the cruise phase can easily lead to airspace infringement, loss of separation or terrain proximity. FMS input errors during the approach phase may result in unstabilised approach or a runway excursion.
