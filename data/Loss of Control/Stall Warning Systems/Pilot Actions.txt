Pilot response to any stall warning including: Buffeting or the activation of a stall warning system. Uncommanded roll or the inability to control roll. The inability to arrest descent by increasing the angle of attack (applying back stick or yoke). should be instinctive and immediate. At the first indication of an impending stall, the pilot should: Positively reduce the angle of attack. Level the wings. Retract speedbrakes if extended. Add power/thrust as recommended by the manufacturer. In some cases, this will involve the immediate application of maximum available power/thrust. In others, the application of power/thrust will be on an "as required" basis and will not occur until after reduction of the angle of attack has been achieved.. Recover to a safe attitude, speed and altitude.
