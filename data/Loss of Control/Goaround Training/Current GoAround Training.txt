From the results of a worldwide airline survey (including both ATQP and non-ATQP operators)[4] it seems that some airlines are taking the opportunity to provide more realistic and representative go-around training. This slide shows that go-arounds from all the different phases of approach are included in some training programmes. Ideally each of these scenarios would be included in 100% of programmes. As well as different phases of approach, different training programmes also include the following aspects to enhance realism: go-around with intermediate flap settings. engine failure during go-around. full go-around procedure (Missed Approach) â€“ no vectors. go-around policy (Stabilised Approach). go-around decision making. distribution of tasks between Pilot Flying (PF) and Pilot Monitoring (PM). assertiveness of pilot non-flying. standard cockpit call-outs. go-around reporting. lessons learned from Industry. ATQP.
