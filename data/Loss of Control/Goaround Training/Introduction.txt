SKYbrary contains a broad-range of articles, references and further reading to assist airlines, air traffic control organisations, aircraft manufacturers and regulatory authorities with ideas for improving go-around training (see all the links below). Specifically, being able to tailor training to match operational scenarios that carry the most risk: in the spirit of an Advanced Training Qualification Programme (ATQP) if you like! These three SKYbrary portals are useful starting points: Presentations and Papers from the Go-Around Safety Forum. Videos of Presentations from the Go-Around Safety Forum. Stabilised Approach Awareness Toolkit for ATC. This article briefly discusses the training opportunities that exist for training pilots, what go-around training is typically undertaken and what changes could be made to improve go-around safety.
