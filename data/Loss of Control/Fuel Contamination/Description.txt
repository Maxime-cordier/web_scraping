It is of critical importance that the fuel taken onboard at uplift is not contaminated in any way since the effects of any such contamination are likely to affect all engines and this may not be evident until after an aircraft has become airborne. The scope of this article is a review the management of the contamination risk insofar as it arises after delivery of fuel of the correct specification[1] to an airport supplier or to a shared airport storage and distribution system. It does not directly address the importance of training or the technical detail which the essential quality control and quality assurance must be based on. Other risks involved in fuel storage and handling at airports are not considered and the focus is primarily on the integrity of jet fuel - although the issues in general apply equally to aviation gasoline.
