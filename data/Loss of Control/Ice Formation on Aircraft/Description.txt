This article aims to address the basics of ice formation on aircraft and in their engine air inlets. It does not consider the formation of frost which is created by sublimation, the process by which water vapour freezes directly onto sub zero surfaces. With this exception, the formation of ice attached to the external surface of an aircraft or to the surfaces within its engine air intakes, requires that liquid water drops impact the surface involved. Usually, that moisture must be supercooled, meaning it must be in liquid form below 0Â°C. There are a couple of specific variations in this general scenario which will be considered later: issues relating to the difference between the temperature of the aircraft skin and the temperature of the air through which it is, has been or will be passing, especially during climb and descent and in the temperature range +/-10 degrees Celsius;. issues arising from the temperature and/or pressure difference between the ambient air and air within engine air inlets, most often reductions in air pressure or increases in air temperature..
