Standard Passenger weights are usually used for load and trim sheet purposes and are often prescribed by the Regulatory Authority which has issued the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) under which the flight is being made. Longitudinal effects of passenger load may be allowed for by dividing the cabin into sections and using standard loading index variations, pre-calculated for each of these compartments. Departure control systems (DCS), may, however, be programmed to use a different index correction for each seat row. The accuracy of this calculation will rely on passengers sitting in the seats assigned at check-in or, if free (unassigned) seating is used, the ground crew or cabin crew will need to record the actual seating occupied, either by cabin section, or, exceptionally, by seat row. In practice, low cost airlines, which routinely offer free seating, also operate the majority of their flights with a high load factor, so that identifying any unoccupied seats will be a fairly simple matter. Where the load factor is medium or low, cabin crew may sometimes be instructed to restrict free seating to the centre of the cabin in order to keep the centre of gravity within limits.
