Three classes of progressively increasing sophistication are defined starting with Type A. In summary, they are as follows: TYPE A APPLICATIONS - document storage and retrieval. TYPE B APPLICATIONS - applications software which enables the independent performance of calculations needed for the operation of the aircraft, the display of aeronautical charts without actual aircraft position, use of electronic checklists, uses the Internet and/or other aircraft operational communications, displays weather information or facilitates aircraft video camera surveillance displays. TYPE C APPLICATIONS - relate to the active control of the aircraft in flight and/or duplicate any certified avionics system and/or which, due to automatic interactions with other aircraft systems, displays and controls, raise significant human factors issues. Note: Type C applications are currently not considered potential EFB applications. The adopted policy by both EASA and FAA is that any non-Type A or non-Type B software application should undergo a full airworthiness approval and so become a certified avionics function.
