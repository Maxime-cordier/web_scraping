In the early days of jet engine powered transport aircraft, engine failures, in all phases of flight, were a fairly frequent occurrence. Statistics from the 1960's indicate that failures resulting in inflight shutdowns occurred at an approximate rate of 40 per 100,000 flight hours (or 1 per 2,500 flight hours). This rate is the equivalent of every engine failing once every year. By contrast, the failure rate of the engines installed on current generation aircraft have a failure rate of less than 1 per 100,000 flight hours. Infrequent as this might seem, engines do fail and a failure during takeoff has very serious safety of flight implications. The aerodynamic effects of the failure and the immediate actions by the flight crew, which are necessary to ensure an acceptable outcome, are similar to those in a light, twin engine aircraft. However, unlike their smaller cousins, the certification criteria for multi-engine transport category jet aircraft require that the aircraft be capable of achieving a specified minimum climb rate, that will ensure obstacle clearance, should an engine failure occur on takeoff.
