Crew members must make themselves familiar with the explanatory notes to their performance data. Only by gaining an understanding of the assumptions made in the calculations can best use be made of the data. If aircraft engines were 100% reliable, engine failure during takeoff would never occur. Over the years, manufacturers have made great improvements in the reliability of their products and the failure rate of turbine engines has decreased with each generation. It is unlikely, however, that the potential for engine failure will ever be completely eliminated. Maintenance personnel can reduce the risk of failure by ensuring that the engines are maintained to the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations. Ground crew and flight crew must ensure during their preflight and postflight inspections that all fluids are adequate, that there are no obvious leaks or damage and that the fuel supply is free from water or other contamination. Flight crew / dispatch performance calculations must ensure that the aircraft can meet regulatory requirements in the event of an engine failure during the takeoff. Flight crew should have a thorough understanding of the aerodynamics of a failure and clearly understand the actions that must be taken should a failure occur. Finally, crews must be completely familiar with their Company procedures which will always take priority.
