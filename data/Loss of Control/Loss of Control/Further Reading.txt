A good summary of the causes, effects and modes of prevention of loss of control is contained in the article "Aerodynamic Principles of Large-Airplane Upsets" by The Boeing Company", which may be viewed at their website.. "Applying Take-off Thrust On Unsuitable Pavement Surface May Have Hidden Dangers" looks at the situation where an aircraft can suffer structural damage from debris thrown up by jet efflux/prop wash.
