When a go-around is initiated with the aircraft in landing configuration (landing gear, flaps etc. extended) a loss of altitude is inevitable while the engine accelerates and the pitch change and increased power take effect. However, if a go around is initiated when airspeed is already below the prescribed figure because engine thrust has been and remains too low, then it may already be unstable and recovery from such a situation necessitates careful handling as thrust is added and pitch attitude changed. Low airspeed and/or thrust means that the altitude loss after selection of go-around thrust is likely to be more than in a normal situation. The illustration below, taken from the Briefing Note on Energy Management produced as part of the FSF ALAR Toolkit, illustrates this point. This Briefing Note states that deceleration below the applicable final approach speed should occur only during manoeuvres to achieve terrain avoidance, collision-avoidance or recovery from wind shear whilst noting that all three of these require the selection of TO/GA thrust.
