Professional pilots operating heavier aircraft, are exposed to engine failure training using a full motion simulator. There is no such realistic training device available to the pilot of most light twin propeller driven aircraft so that asymmetric flight training must take place in the aircraft. The inherent risk of simulating a failure on the runway or in the early stages of climb by retarding a throttle is obvious. For that reason, most airborne training is done well above the ground at speeds that intentionally exceed stall speed and Vmca by a significant safety margin. This can give the trainee pilot a false perception of the true characteristics of an engine failure on takeoff. Once multi-engine qualified, many private pilots do not undertake single engine flight practice to maintain their skills.
