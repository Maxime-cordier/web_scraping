The regulator mandates that crews demonstrate, in the simulator, competence at go–round from Decision Minima, when the aircraft is close to Vref and has drag flap deployed. This is fine but in real life many go-rounds are flown much earlier in the approach, prior to full flap selection and potentially close to flap limit speed to maintain separation from the following aircraft. These are rarely practiced in the sim – there is barely enough time to do the mandated items, never mind gain some handling experience - and invariably they lead to speed limits being exceeded or level busts. Crews should give some thought to how they would manage a Go-Around at all stages of an approach, including the following: It may be appropriate to consider continuing down the approach path, if legally permitted, for a few moments whilst the handling of the Go-Around and the configuration is discussed before being actioned.. Going around from above the missed approach altitude may require the pilot to level off and maintain their current altitude or a modified altitude as instructed by ATC.. In congested airspace the missed approach altitude, track and speed is usually mandated. This can be a complicated affair if the Go-Around instruction or decision is made above the mandated missed approach altitude.. To ensure correct sequencing and compliance with the Go-Around procedure in FMS equipped aircraft it is often advisable (if conditions allow) to continue on the approach until the aircraft descends below the missed approach altitude before selecting TOGA.. Relying on LNAV for the lateral part of the Go-round guidance can create a significant problem if the FMS flight plan legs have not sequenced correctly prior to initiating the G/A, then the lateral path of the G/A is likely to flown incorrectly..
