If the Go-Around is conducted because of weather conditions, the transition to instruments will require particular attention. The Go-Around procedure may be further complicated if airspeed and/or thrust setting are low. See the separate article "Go-Around - Transition to Instrument Flying". Many airlines use a procedure (particularly in poor weather conditions) where the non-landing pilot will fly the approach down to Decision Altitude with the specific intention of going around at Decision Altitude unless they have a clear call of the decision to continue the approach and take control from the Landing Pilot. This can make both acquisition of the required visual reference easier and obviate the necessity of the pilot flying the Go-Around from making the transition from instruments to visual and then back to instruments if a Go-Around is flown.
