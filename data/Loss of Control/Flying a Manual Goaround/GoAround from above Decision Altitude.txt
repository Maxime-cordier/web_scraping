In training, most Go-Arounds are commenced at or near Decision Altitude. A G/A flown due to bad wx has usually been anticipated & briefed. It is the G/A flown in ‘good’ wx (perhaps due to ATC) or the G/A is commenced from a point other than DA, which usually presents the greatest problems. Pilots should be mentally prepared to be told to Go-Around from any point on the Approach, even from above the Go-Around Altitude. Practice in flying a Go-Around is normally included in routine refresher training and analysis of Flight Data Monitoring data indicates a need for practice in flying Go-Arounds flown from above Decision Altitude/Height as well as the more commonly practiced Go-Around from DA/H.
