When performing an action on the flight guidance control panel or the FMS central display unit — or control/display unit (CDU) — to give a command to the automated flight system (AFS), the pilot has an expectation of the aircraft reaction and, therefore, must have in mind the following questions: What do I want the aircraft to fly now?. What do I want the aircraft to fly next?. These imply answering the following questions: Which mode did I engage and which target did I set for the aircraft to fly now?. Is the aircraft following the intended vertical and horizontal flight path and targets?. Which mode did I arm and which target did I preset for the aircraft to fly next?. To answer these questions, one must understand the key role of the following controls and displays: Flight guidance control panel — mode-selection keys, target-setting knobs and display windows. FMS CDU — keyboard, line-select keys, display pages and messages. Flight mode annunciator (FMA) on the primary flight display (PFD). PFD and navigation display (ND) displays and scales for cross-checking guidance targets. The effective monitoring of these controls and displays increases flight crew awareness of the available guidance for flight path and speed control: Status of the autoflight system (i.e., modes being engaged or armed); and,. Active guidance targets. The active monitoring of controls and displays also enables the pilot to predict and anticipate the entire sequence of flight mode annunciations throughout successive flight phases (i.e., throughout mode transitions or mode reversions).
