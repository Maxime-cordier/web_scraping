Following the accident investigation, the airline initiated corrective measures based on an external safety audit. The emphasis was on creating a safety culture by establishing an independent flight safety department. Awareness of CRM and its associated training were improved, as well as crew selection and skills checking. Flight manuals, checklists and emergency procedures were reviewed and updated. Furthermore, procedures for introduction of new airplanes into service were also improved.
