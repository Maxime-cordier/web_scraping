This Briefing Note (BN) covers important lifestyle aspects for pilotsâ€”illness, the use of medications and drugs, nutrition and eating habits, alcohol and caffeine intake, and exercise. It is information that you can use to assess your own fitness for flight and to know when to seek the advice of your doctor or flight surgeon. Your personal doctor knows your medical condition best and what is most important for your overall health. He or she, however, may not be trained to appreciate the effects of your medical condition or the drugs he/she prescribes on flight risk. Your flight surgeon, on the other hand, may not be familiar with your overall health but is well aware of the consequences of lifestyle decisions on flight safety. You should make sure that both medical professionals have the information they need about you and your lifestyle to advise you properly and to work as a team.
