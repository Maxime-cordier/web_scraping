from the wing inspection to remain on the flight deck to monitor the fuel status. The balance between the tanks is reached, and the system is reconfigured into the initial state with the cross-feed valve closed. After 34 min of flight, the left tank low-level fuel flag comes up, indicating that there are only 750 Kg (1,650 lb) remaining. The cross-feed valve is opened. The airplane is on descent around 40 nm from the destination airport. Because you are close to the end of the flight, you continue toward your destination after briefly considering a diversion. One-and-a-half minutes later, following an additional fuel check showing the fuel level constantly decreasing at a high rate, you realize that there is a risk of emptying both tanks through the leak using the cross-feed valve. You decide to close the valve. You are certain now there is a significant leak. Thirty nine minutes into the flight, descending on approach through 6,400 ft, the left engine shuts down. You follow the procedures for engine failure and engine shutdown, except for the cross-feed valve, and you make an emergency call to ATC. You continue the approach on one engine, deliberately above the glide path in case the right engine stops too. The rest of the approach and the landing are uneventful. There are only 800 Kg (1,760 lb) remaining in the right wing tank when the airplane stops at the ramp.
