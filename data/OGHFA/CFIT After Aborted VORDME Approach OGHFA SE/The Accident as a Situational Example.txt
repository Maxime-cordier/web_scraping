You are the pilot flying a VHF Omnidirectional Radio Range (VOR)-Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) (VHF omnidirectional radio/distance measuring equipment) approach to a mountainous, high-altitude airport, in instrument weather conditions and a nonradar environment. You were late solving a flaps problem. The airport is surrounded by high mountains where the minimum obstacle clearance altitude (Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude) is 17,200 ft, and the use of full flaps is necessary for the steep final approach. Because of the delay in solving the flaps problem, you are too high and too close. You decide it is not possible to continue the straight-in approach. You inform the airport traffic control tower of your intention to start the approach again and request a left turn back to the previous “Beacon XXX” fix. The controller does not understand the request and does not provide the clearance. Worrying about potential controlled flight into terrain (CFIT), you start climbing on your own initiative to 18,000 ft while turning right south-southwest of the VOR to return to the original heading. During the turn, the clearance to proceed to Beacon XXX is finally given — though you do not perceive it as such — and you are asked to contact the area control center (ACC) controller. You then receive another clearance to Beacon XXX from the ACC controller and descend to 11,500 ft. At that moment, the controller thinks your airplane is heading south as he deals with other traffic. Before changing direction, the airplane passes over the VOR. Consequently, Beacon XXX and other waypoints disappear from the map display, leaving it without data. Immediately, you and your first officer turn your full attention to the management of the flight management system (FMS). You don’t look outside. The first officer starts to realize the danger of the situation, but you continue to monitor the DME without mentioning the radial. The ground-proximity warning system (GPWS) suddenly generates a “terrain, terrain, pull up, pull up” warning. You interpret the warning as a false alarm, and the airplane, still heading north, collides with a mountain.
