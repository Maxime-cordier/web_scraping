This situational example describes an accident that was caused by the captain’s preoccupation with an in-flight engine malfunction and his failure to properly monitor the flight instruments. This resulted in loss of control and the captain’s inability to restore the airplane to stable flight until it had descended to 9,500 ft. This accident could have been prevented if the flight crew had recognized that they were distracted and had lost situational awareness by relying too much on automation, and had demonstrated proper decision making to restore their situational awareness. Addressing human factors issues in situations such as preventing airplane loss of control requires concentrating on the following key activities: Maintain situational awareness at all times and assess whether available information is sufficient to support mission goals.. Be sensitive to the possibility of experiencing confusion potentially associated with never-before-seen situations.. Work together as a team to make appropriate decisions, taking into account the operational facts and priorities of the situation.. Manage pressures, stress and distractions due to unexpected events or unusual and infrequent circumstances..
