You are in descent for a surveillance radar approach (SRA) to the runway. The aircraft is cleared to 1,500 ft with radar vectors to a point “XYZ” located some 9 nm south of the airport. Weather is reported as visibility 5,000 m (3.1 mi) in rain, with some clouds at 1,000 ft, scattered at 1,800 ft and broken at 3,000 ft. Having been configured for landing, the aircraft is on a northerly heading past “XYZ” using the heading selector. The accuracy of the map display is checked and is consistent with radar information provided by air traffic control (ATC). You select a vertical descent speed of 700 fpm and an indicated airspeed of 135 kt. As the aircraft approaches the visual decision point (VDP) at 1,000 ft, navigation (NAV) accuracy is confirmed, and you can see the runway end identifier lights (REIL) in the expected position. The first officer confirms that the runway lights are in sight when asked by ATC. You select 090 degrees on the heading selector, putting the aircraft into a right turn with a bank of 20 to 25 degrees. You then disengage the autopilot and autothrottles, deselect the flight director, maintain a steady bank and a descent rate of 700 fpm, checking that you can still see the REIL. The first officer monitors heading selection and airspeed and preselects the tower frequency, during which he no longer sees the runway strobe lights (REIL). Neither do you. You decide on an immediate go-around and flaps 20. You apply manual go-around thrust but do not select the go-around switch on the thrust levers. The first officer advises ATC of the go-around and notes that his attitude director indicator (ADI) is not annunciating “GA.” He advises you, and you who push the go-around switch, prompting the flight directors to command a climb on the existing aircraft track. At about that time, ATC instructs you to turn to a heading of 180 degrees, which is selected by the first officer, who notes high ground depicted on the left side of his horizontal situation indicator (HSI). A “TERRAIN” alert is displayed on the enhanced ground-proximity warning system (EGPWS). Once level at the minimum descent altitude, you decide to divert to another airport as you believe low clouds caused the crew to lose sight of the runway strobe lights at the intended destination.
