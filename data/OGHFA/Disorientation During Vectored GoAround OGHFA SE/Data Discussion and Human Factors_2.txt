degrees to the right and through a heading of 077 degrees. It then descended a further 100 ft before actually climbing. It achieved a climb rate of 3,000 fpm while turning to a heading of 140 degrees, remaining there for 12 seconds, then turned left to a heading of 134 degrees for another 12 seconds before ATC brought it to 180 degrees, over land and at 2,100 ft. The missed approach procedure actually calls for a climb to 3,900 ft on runway heading, and standard ATC instructions for a missed approach from the VDP are to turn onto a north-easterly heading to ensure remaining clear of the high surrounding terrain.
