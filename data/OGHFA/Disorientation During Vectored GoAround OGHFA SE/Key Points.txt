This situational example describes an approach incident caused by loss of visual contact, inadequate workload management and subsequent disorientation in a turning climb. ATC had to intervene to avoid a risk of CFIT. Before the incident, ineffective crew briefings and nonadherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) made the crew unusually susceptible to spatial disorientation. Inadequate go-around procedures left the crew with an ambiguity as to where to go around to. This situational example shows how difficulties with visual contact may result in a go-around that may itself induce dangerous vestibular and spatial disorientation effects. An example is the leans. With a slow rate of roll, a pilot may feel the aircraft is still flying straight and level, although the attitude indicator shows that the aircraft is indeed banking. A go-around procedure should not contain an acceleration and continuing turn that may contribute to disorientation. Crews might suffer somatogyral (coriolis) as well as somatogravic (false climb) disorientation. When flying to an airport that requires a special release, the arrival briefing should summarize these key points: Make sure you know where to go around to (being prepared for a go-around).. Review the availability, awareness of and adherence to SOPs (discipline).. Maintaining visual contact with the runway strobe lights must be accomplished by at least one crewmember.. Rely on automation to support task sharing and workload management.. Maintain a high level of concentration and effective coordination with ATC.. Remain prepared for a go-around; if performed, beware of visual illusions that may occur.. Maintain continuous instrument scanning to counter vestibular disorientation.. Trust your instruments, keeping in mind that distortion of sensed information can have strong effects on situation assessment and decision making..
