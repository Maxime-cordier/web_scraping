the checklist. The crew can complete the checklist down to that line and then pause until further action is appropriate and the remaining checklist items can be meaningfully completed. Some aircraft models feature electronic displays of normal checklists that use color coding or other graphic treatments to provide a positive identification of items… Already completed. Currently being (or to be) addressed. Still to be performed. If the flow of a normal checklist must be interrupted for any reason (including a built-in hold point), the PF should announce a formal and explicit hold such as, “Hold (stop) checklist at (item).” An explicit call such as, “Resume (continue) checklist at (item),” should be made before the checklist is resumed. Upon resuming the normal checklist after an interruption, the last completed item before the hold point should be repeated. The repetition of this single item helps prevent the inadvertent omission of the next item on the checklist when it is resumed.
