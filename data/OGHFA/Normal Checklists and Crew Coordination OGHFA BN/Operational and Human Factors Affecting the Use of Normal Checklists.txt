To ensure effective compliance with published normal checklists, it is important to understand why pilots sometimes completely omit a normal checklist or do not complete all the items. The omission of a normal checklist is rarely intentional. Rather, this type of dangerous deviation from adherence to SOPs is often the result of a disruption of the normal flow of cockpit activities caused by operational circumstances. The following factors and conditions are often cited as causing a failure to initiate or complete a normal checklist: Unusual or out-of-phase flight timing that can occur whenever a factor such as an unexpected tailwind or a system malfunction modifies the time scale of the approach or the time of occurrence of the trigger event for the initiation of the normal checklist. Distractions, such as from other flight deck activities. Interruptions, such as from pilot-controller communications. Task saturation, including inadequate multi-tasking ability or task overload. Incorrect management of priorities, often because of the absence of a decision-making model for time-critical situations. Reduced attention (tunnel vision), such as in abnormal or high-workload conditions. Incorrect CRM techniques, including the absence of effective cross-check, poor crew coordination or no crew backup. Overreliance on memory (overconfidence). Ineffective checklist design, including inadequate or incorrect content, poorly defined task sharing and/or confusing or obscure formatting. Poor habits formed during transition or recurrent training or as a byproduct of ineffective line checks because of insufficient emphasis on strict adherence to normal checklists.
