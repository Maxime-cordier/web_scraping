Exposure to noise may induce pathological effects, mainly cardio-vascular disease. This is due to the generation of high levels of adrenaline that narrow blood vessel diameter resulting in increased blood pressure. After three to five years of regular exposure to 85 dB noise, morbidity increased significantly increased. Other common pathological problems related to noise are cholesterol issues, gastric ulcers, sleep disturbances and mental stress. Approximately 10 percent of the population in industrialized societies has significant hearing loss. Pathological effects of noise on hearing are known as a Permanent Threshold Shift (PTS), meaning the threshold of hearing has permanently increased. One of the difficulties of detecting PTS is that in the early stages a person may not be aware of any issues. Figure 10 shows that at an early stage (Curve 1) speech is not affected and the person is still able to hear others speak. At this stage, only a specialized exam (audiogram) is able to detect the problem. As PTS increases as depicted by Curves 2 and 3, the hearing loss affects speech intelligibility, and the person starts to be aware that there is an issue. A PTS may occur after a short exposure to noise higher than 90 dB or as a result of cumulative exposure to relatively moderate levels of noise, such as 70 dB.
