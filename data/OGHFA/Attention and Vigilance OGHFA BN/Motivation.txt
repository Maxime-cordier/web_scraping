Motivation plays a very important role in task performance. Motivation is generally referred to as being either intrinsic or extrinsic to the individual. Intrinsic motivation comes from internal factors and involves a willingness or desire to achieve a certain level of performance for personal satisfaction. In a vigilance task, this motivation can be enhanced by giving feedback after each response (e.g., the response was good or bad, quick or slow). When such feedback or knowledge of results is given, performance is typically higher than when no feedback is given. Extrinsic motivation is related to factors external to the individual and generally involves rewards (or punishment) for performance. Figure 7 demonstrates that, depending on information given to an individual, performance can change dramatically. Subjects were told that they were either involved in a recruitment process where they were being tested or were involved in a laboratory research project. Those people that were told they were being recruited performed much better than those that were told they were simply participating in a laboratory experiment. The external motivation of being “recruited” and the potential for reward stimulated the participants to perform better. Figure 7.
