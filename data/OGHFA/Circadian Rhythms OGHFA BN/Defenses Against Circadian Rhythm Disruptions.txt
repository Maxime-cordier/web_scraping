A number of strategies can be used to counteract the effects of transmeridian and translongitudinal flight. To counteract disruptions to your circadian rhythms: Know your normal body clock times for sleeping and eating by using the Body Clock Questionnaire (BCQ). Determine how you are adjusting to local time during layovers by using the Layover Adjustment Questionnaire (LAAQ). Based on the BCQ and LAAQ, attempt to modify your sleeping and eating schedules to adjust for maximum alertness. Try to only eat meals and drink coffee or tea at times when your sleep will not be adversely affected. Use good nap management before and during flight. Coordinate rest and meal periods with other crewmembers. Exercise at appropriate times. Expose yourself to sunlight at appropriate times.
