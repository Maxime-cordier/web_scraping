You are flying an eastbound transatlantic route at night. The flight is planned for a northerly route to benefit from upper-level winds toward Europe. Established in cruise at Flight Level (FL) 350, flying toward 69N/90W, the relief pilot has been sent back for the first rest period. The first officer is going to take the next rest break and you the last. The first alternate is an airport at 90W, the second is at 20W, the next is in Europe, as a closer one in Iceland is forecast to be down to 400 ft broken, albeit with adequate visibility. Approaching 90W, you notice that oil quantity is dropping on the no. 2 engine. At this point, both you and the first officer look in the logbook for oil checks and notice no oil has been added for some time, indicating a good engine up to the moment you took over the airplane. You assume the oil loss is real and contact dispatch. The reply from dispatch is that it is likely an indication problem, so you consult the flight crew operating manual (FCOM) and the quick reference handbook (QRH). These documents advise pressing on in the absence of any pressure and temperature changes. However, the fall in oil quantity does not cease, and the level would reach zero by 70W. Diversion would become a matter of necessity in case of significant oil pressure or temperature changes. You consider alternatives, such as flying back 150 minutes, diverting to another airport 120 minutes away with a 7,500-ft (2,286-m) runway but good facilities, or diverting to another airport that is possible to reach in a short time, although with poor weather. You decide to continue, and inform dispatch. Up to now, the cabin crew has not been informed of any problems. When the airplane crosses 60W at 73N, some 300 nm (556 km) south of Greenland, the first officer returns from his rest, unable to sleep. Oceanic air traffic control (ATC) clears you to cross 40W at 72N. You collect all weather data at alternate airports via Satcom while discussing diversion options. You decide to divert at the first indication of any other problems, be it an oil temperature or pressure drop, or a pressure differential of 20 psi. With oil pressure and temperature having remained at the same level for the entire flight, you decide to climb to FL 370 at 40W. Some 15 minutes after getting there, no. 2 engine oil pressure starts to drop. You decide to divert and transmit a “pan” call, requesting clearance to an airport 313 nm (580 km) southwest. Iceland Control gives an immediate clearance via HF and arranges for a phone patch to dispatch so as to supplement the data link. You advise the cabin crew. They prepare promptly for the landing and inform the passengers of the precautionary diversion. You initiate a drift down, throttling back the no. 2 engine, rather than shutting it down. The first officer and relief pilot review the approach
