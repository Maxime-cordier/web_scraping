and cross-checking. You may have difficulty in activities such as attending to radio calls, making accurate switch settings, making or listening to altitude call-outs and meeting crossing restrictions. If you lack the essential information normally obtained by performing these activities effectively, you will have difficulty making good judgements and decisions. The various physical and mental manifestations of fatigue ultimately lead to pilot error. When you are tired, the probability of making errors increases particularly in the following situations: Difficult flights (e.g., high-density zone crossing, unfavourable weather, technical problems). During a high density of verbal exchanges (e.g., simultaneous or continuous solicitations from air traffic control, cabin crew and/or cockpit crew-members). Executing actions in a limited amount of time (e.g., cockpit preparation before the flight, system monitoring under time pressure)..
