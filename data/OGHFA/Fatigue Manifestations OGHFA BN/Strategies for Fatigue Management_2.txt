vigilance phase. Passive vigilance phases are characterized by a lower level of direct supervision of the flight. Meals or snacks can be eaten, but preferably at the start of these phases. Activities not related to the flight are encouraged during passive vigilance phases, e.g., reading papers. During the night, or if you are sleep-deprived, it is recommended that you make use of the passive vigilance phases to take a nap of 20 to 40 minutes. The alternation between active and passive vigilance phases is most appropriate during quiet cruise periods. Remember to announce the end of each active-passive vigilance phase to your fellow crew-member(s) so that they will be sure to know which phase they are expected to be in. Your fatigue level in short-haul operations is affected by a combination of flight schedule and the number of legs you fly in a day. On the whole, morning flights induce more fatigue than afternoon flights or alternating morning and afternoon duties. Adhering to the following rules regarding duty-roster scheduling and work organization can help avoid SRF fatigue problems: Limit the number of successive morning rosters (maximum two days). Limit the number of successive night rosters (maximum three days). Alternate morning and afternoon roster instead of using all morning rosters (e.g., two days of consecutive morning duties and two of afternoon). Avoid short nights off that finish late and start early. Reduce the number of legs in the most difficult roster and in particular for the last day of the roster. Avoid short stopovers (less than 35 minutes). Short stopovers do not take into account unexpected events or the need for the aircrew to have a break.
