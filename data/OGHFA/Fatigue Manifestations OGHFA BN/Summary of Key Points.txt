Pilot fatigue is reflective of the effects of pilot work schedules and the nature of the job, which includes north/south and east/west travel. Specific factors such as night flights, jet lag and successive early wake-ups contribute to increased fatigue. For SRF, time pressure, number of legs per day and consecutive days on duty can contribute to increased fatigue. In LRF, disruption of circadian rhythms and loss of sleep are the main concerns.. You should be aware of the signs of fatigue, which include a reduction in alertness and attention, lack of concentration, increased response times, small mistakes, a reduction of social communications, and poor comprehension.. You can use simple strategies such as developing a good sleep routine, only using the bedroom for sleep, not ingesting alcohol or caffeine and not worrying or working prior to going to sleep to improve sleep and reduce fatigue.. You can also self-manage fatigue in the cockpit during LRF by desynchronizing activities so that one pilot rests while the other is vigilant. Organizations can reduce fatigue during SRF by good management of rosters and avoiding short stopovers..
