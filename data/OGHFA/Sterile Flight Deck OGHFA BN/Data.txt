Failure to comply with sterile flight deck discipline is a contributor to accidents and incidents. While it is difficult to quantify which events were caused specifically by non-compliance with the sterile flight deck discipline, it is not unreasonable to consider that it contributed to the 72% of the 76 approach and landing accidents and serious incidents surveyed in the Flight Safety Foundation Approach and Landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) Tool Kit from 1984 to 1997. In addition to safety consequences, poor sterile flight deck behavior is likely responsible for many other weaknesses and inefficiencies in aviation operations that lead to poor performance and wasted money. Additional detailed data associated with the components of the sterile flight deck concept can be found in the briefing notes titled Discipline, Pilot Judgment and Expertise, Effective Pilot-Controller Communications, Decision Making, Introduction to Airmanship and Risk Assessment.
