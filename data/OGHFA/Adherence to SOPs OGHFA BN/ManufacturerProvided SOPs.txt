SOPs published by manufacturers are designed to: Reflect the cockpit-design and operating philosophies of the manufacturer. Promote the maximally effective use of aircraft-specific design features. Apply to a broad range of airline operations and operating environments with the objectives of standardizing crew behavior and ensuring that all required safety-related actions are followed. The first SOPs for a new aircraft model are typically based on: Lessons learned from previous operating experience. Analyses performed during design. Experience gained during development and certification flight testing. Experience from the route-proving program. After new aircraft are introduced into service, initial SOPs are periodically reviewed and enhanced based on feedback from end users. This feedback includes reports on the use of SOPs in training, line operations and incident and accident analyses.
