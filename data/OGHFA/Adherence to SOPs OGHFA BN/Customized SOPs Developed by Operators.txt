Manufacturer-provided SOPs can be adopted without change by an airline or used as the basis for the development of customized SOPs that promote standardization across the different aircraft fleets in service at the airline. The level of any expanded information included by an airline should be tailored to reflect that airline’s operating and training philosophies. An airline can also deviate from manufacturer-provided SOPs, if necessary. Before the SOPs provided by the manufacturer can be changed, however, the change must be reviewed and coordinated with the manufacturer. Deviations also typically require approval by the airline’s operational authority. There are several reasons why an airline may have to review and update its SOPs. First, an airline’s SOPs must be reviewed and reassessed whenever there is a revision to the manufacturer-provided SOPs. Second, updates to an airline’s SOPs may be prompted by internal company feedback. Regardless of what prompted the need for a revision, each proposed change in SOPs must be coordinated with the manufacturer and the airline’s operational authority. Line pilots and cabin crewmembers should be involved in the development and revision of company SOPs, along with the flight standards team. This involvement helps to: Promote critical and constructive feedback. Ensure that rules and procedures, as well as reasons for their adoption, are fully understandable by end users.
