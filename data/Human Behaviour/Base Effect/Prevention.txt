Prevention of Base Effect hinges on good airmanship and discipline. Tenets of good discipline include: Not accepting the perspective that rules must sometimes be bent to get the job done;. Rejecting the notion that Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) apply only to those with less ability and experience;. Rejecting shortcuts and refusing to abandon the rules to do things that appear to be “better”, "easier" or "more efficient"; and,. Planning and preparing for problems before they arise.. A well-disciplined pilot will follow the appropriate rules and procedures, both at his/her home aerodrome and while away, unless an emergency situation compels a deviation. A disciplined controller will follow standard procedures and protocols and take steps to ensure that operators within their area of responsibility are compliant with all applicable rules, regulations and procedures. The benefits of elimination, or even reduction, of Base Effect are significant in the context of enhancing safety of flight.
