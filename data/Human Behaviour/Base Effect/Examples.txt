Examples of these localised deviations are numerous and can vary from location to location. They include, but are not limited to, failure to follow published arrival or departure procedures, failure to fly at appropriate airspeeds, failure to comply with standard circuit joining procedures, adoption of non-standard circuit patterns, failure to use standard communication phraseology, omission of position reports, flight at inappropriate altitudes, failure to yield right of way, and so forth. Over time, these non-standard procedures become the norm for local traffic and, in the context of a controlled aerodrome, the ATS expectation. Thus, the introduction of transient traffic, marginal weather, an emergency or other abnormal situation can lead to confusion, increased controller workload, reduced situational awareness and an increased potential for a loss of separation.
