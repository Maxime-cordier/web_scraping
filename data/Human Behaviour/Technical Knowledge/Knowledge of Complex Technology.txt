As aviation technology has become more complex, especially aircraft automated systems, the pilot has become a servant of the computer, instead of the other way round[1]. These complex technical systems have become less “transparent” to pilots, based on their complexity, wide capabilities, and the time restrictions placed on training and employing pilots: not least the need for pilots to learn, understand and apply a wide-range of other technical knowledge. This means that technical knowledge in some areas must necessarily be restricted i.e. fully understanding how the autopilot and flight management system “behaves” in all modes and laws under all situations. Therefore, as technology complexity and capability increases, new risks can be introduced where operators' technical knowledge does not keep pace.
