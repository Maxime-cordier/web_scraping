The term socio-culture refers to the combination, or interaction, of social and cultural elements. Whilst socio-cultural factors can affect the performance of an individual working alone (e.g. due to ethical reasons), we are here concerned with socio-cultural factors where two or more people are interacting in the workplace. The definitions given here are tailored to suit the aviation perspective, especially on the flight deck. Social factors: relate to personal interactions between people who find themselves in the same place, at the same time, and who need to coordinate with each other to achieve a common task, i.e. flight crewmembers.. Cultural factors: refer to the collective values, beliefs and behaviours[1] held by a group of people who share a common identity; especially as differentiated from other (different) groups of people.. From the definitions above, it is evident that culture can greatly affect an individualâ€™s social interactions with someone from a different culture. But also, interactions between people from the same culture can be affected where the degree (or depth) to which values and beliefs are held vary.
