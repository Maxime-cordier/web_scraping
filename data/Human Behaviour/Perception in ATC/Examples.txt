Misperception can occur in all ATC situations. Here are some examples: A flight is cleared to a heading of 290°. The pilot mishears the clearance and reads back “Flight Level 290”. The ATCO expects to hear back 290 and that is what is heard. For that reason the word “flight level” can easily be missed.. A flight is cleared to climb to Flight Level 250. The pilot mishears the clearance and reads back “Flight Level 290”. The pilot may have planned flight level 290 and that’s why they hear 290 instead of 250. Only a slight distraction can be enough to make people hear what they expect to hear instead of what has really been said.. A flight is given a climb clearance that is taken by another aircraft on frequency which was expecting a climb clearance. Again it is the expectation which creates the incorrect perception.. An ATCO sees an assigned FL 330 in a label and plans the other actions on this perception. Later it turns out that FL350 has always been displayed in the label. Possibly the ATCO perceived FL330 because it suited the plans better.. A tower controller does not see the strobe lights of an aircraft on the runway because there are a number of other flashing lights in the same direction due to work in progress.. In all these examples the incorrect perception could easily have led to a dangerous situation if not corrected. If not challenged, it may well lead the controller to a completely incorrect Situational Awareness.
