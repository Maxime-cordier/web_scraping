Perception is not merely the process of how information goes through the eyes to the brain, but rather a “set of processes through which we recognize, organize, and make sense of the sensations we receive from the environment” (Sternberg, 2003). What you see is not necessarily what’s really there. What you hear is not necessarily what’s been said. We get ‘tricked’ by the way the information we receive is processed in our brain. The first stage of Human Information Processing is Perception. This is the stage where the brain decides what it is that has been received. If this decision is incorrect, we have an incorrect image of the world around us. This means that all subsequent Information Processing will be based on an incorrect premise. Processes like Decision Making and following Actions may therefore be wrong as well and it may be obvious that this can easily lead to highly undesired situations in ATM. Perception and vigilance are closely related and affect the accuracy and currency of our mental model of the air traffic situation. The vigilant ATCO can detect situations where a misperception is likely and will therefore be more likely to detect whether their perception is correct than a non vigilant ATCO.
