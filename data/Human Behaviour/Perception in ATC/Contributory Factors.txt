Our perception of a situation relies on a combination of different sensory inputs and our existing mental model of the situation. Our senses may be misled by optical illusion or by its auditory counterpart. Perception is strongly influenced by what we expect to see or hear - expectation bias. Our perception is also dependant on the context from which the specific information stimuli are derived. It has been shown that the same stimuli can mean different things in different environments. Some equipment displays can give rise to optical illusion (e.g. aircraft trajectory is difficult to interpret, or certain font characters are easy to confuse). In some cases, equipment design has flaws which can make it easier to make a perceptual error and therefore harder to detect and correct it. Some equipment displays may not allow all operational staff to view them clearly. This is particularly important when angle of sight from some screens does not allow a clear view. Examples include multiple screen displays and/or training/mentoring situations. Sometimes, equipment can be adjusted or modified to take account of design flaws. In other cases, it may be possible to develop simple procedures to reduce the chance of error. However, equipment cannot be improved or safety procedures designed unless the shortcomings of the equipment are brought to the notice of managers. Moreover, if design weaknesses are not notified to the manufacturers, there is a real danger that they may be incorporated in future equipment.
