In raw frequencies, SB >> RB > KB 61% of errors are at skill-based (SB) level. 27% of errors are at rule-based (RB) level. 11% of errors are at knowledge-based (KB) level. But if we look at opportunities for error, the order reverses: humans perform vastly more SB tasks than RB, and vastly more RB than KB so a given KB task is more likely to result in error than a given RB or SB task.
