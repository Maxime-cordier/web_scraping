The most notable hazards if a controller working position is staffed by a single person are: Task load too high. This leads to having to perform concurrent tasks.. Distraction. Unexpected occurrences may distract ATCOâ€™s attention.. Lack of redundancy. Staff incapacitation in case of workplace incidents/accidents, illness, toilet relief. Operational imperative of the replacement of staff involved in aviation incident/accident.. Threats and errors. Non-detection of threats and non-recognition of an error.. Fatigue. The individual fatigue is not detected.. Fitness for duty. The individual unfitness for duty is not detected.. Competency. Unnoticed proficiency / competency degradation.. Reduced team interaction. This means that passing on wisdom is reduced - degrading collective wisdom and potentially affecting competency in the long term.. Removal of the four-eye principle. Monitoring each other's actions is a barrier against human error which is removed when SPO is introduced.. Night time SPO presents three major challenges: If there are periods of extremely high workload, SPO may not be a safe option overall.. If there are prolonged periods of low workload, there is greater portential for errors due to boredom or complacency.. The night period coincides with the main window of circadian low (2 am to 6 am) which means that people are more susceptible to fatigue..
