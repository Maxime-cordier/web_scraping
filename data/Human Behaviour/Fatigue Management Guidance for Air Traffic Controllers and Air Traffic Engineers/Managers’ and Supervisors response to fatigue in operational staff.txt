Fatigue will not just go away – it only gets worse. There are a number of steps that a manager or supervisor of operational staff can take: Talk to the controller or engineer and ask them if they feel fatigued.. In a non-confrontational way, highlight any signs of fatigue that have been observed and explore the reason for these.. Encourage the staff member to take possible fatigue seriously and refer them to the information and guidance made available to them.. If necessary, agree a plan of action with them – possibly involving referral to a doctor or medical advisor.. Managers and supervisors should make sure that they educate themselves, in general, about fatigue. They should also realise that they too can become fatigued and this can impact their performance and ultimately the safety of the operation.
