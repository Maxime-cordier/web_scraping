When working as an operational air traffic controller, it is important to take responsibility for managing your fatigue (just as you would manage your personal fitness in order to pass your annual medical check). This means that each individual controller and engineer has a professional responsibility to ensure that when they arrive for work they are ‘fit for duty’. Both controllers and engineers need to consider the following fatigue management aspects: Develop a lifestyle that takes account of working shifts.. Get in to good habits to ensure that sufficient ‘good quality’ sleep (i.e. deep and uninterrupted) is obtained.. Prepare adequately before reporting for duty.. Prepare carefully for night shifts.. When carrying out operational duties, use breaks to counteract fatigue..
