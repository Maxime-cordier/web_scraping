Operational air traffic controllers and air traffic engineers are susceptible to fatigue as they need to sustain accurate task performance over a shift period. As they typically work shifts, there will be times within the shift when they will need to maintain alertness when their natural circadian rhythms are making them drowsy. With careful lifestyle management outside work and fatigue management within the workplace, operational staff should be able to manage fatigue risk successfully. Although their managers and supervisors have a role to play to support them, ultimately it is the responsibility of the controller or engineer to be aware of fatigue and to prevent fatigue from affecting their operational performance.
