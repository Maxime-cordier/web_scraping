Rather than propose a single definition of fatigue, it is better to consider a number of key points: Fatigue is a normal physiological state like hunger and thirst that cannot be suppressed. It is a signal that alerts us that we need to rest.. Fatigue typically results from prolonged mental or physical exertion. Lack of good quality sleep and illness can also cause fatigue.. Fatigue can affect a personâ€™s performance and impair their mental alertness, which may lead to dangerous errors.. Fatigue can be temporary (i.e. removed by rest or sleep) or chronic (i.e. building up over a long term and harder to get rid of).. There are three types of fatigue: mental, visual and physical. Operational air traffic controllers are mainly affected by mental and visual fatigue. Engineers could be affected by all three.
