These observations can only be made in a general sense, because each of us responds differently to our moods, i.e. some people can be greatly motivated by an angry mood, whilst others may isolate themselves and resign. So, perhaps, it is more accurate to say that if the following effects are observed, then a negative mood could be behind them: Lack of engagement - non-responsiveness. Over-excitement. Loss of situational awareness. Lack of attention. Lack of vigilance. Focused (tunnel) attention. Lethargy. Impatience. Poor cooperation. Ineffective communication. Ineffective, or irrational decision-making. Aggression (physically and verbally). Passive aggression (mostly verbal). Increased risk tolerance. Loss of discipline (e.g. disregarding procedures). Sabotage. Resignation (total disengagement). etcâ€¦.
