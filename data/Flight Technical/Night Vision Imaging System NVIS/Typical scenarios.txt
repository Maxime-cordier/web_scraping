Typical loss of hazard control scenarios include NVG equipment failure that leads to one or more of the crew losing night vision capability and disorientation, pre-flight preparation which does not take into account the anticipated weather and visibility to support safe NVG operations, insufficient or incompatible equipment or aircraft features leading to a misinformation or misjudgement by the crew, and NVG operations with flight crews lacking training or experience (including recent NVG experience).
