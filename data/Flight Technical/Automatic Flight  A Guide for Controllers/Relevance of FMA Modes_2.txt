engines, the aircraft may not be able to attain or sustain the required airspeed. The airspeed may therefore reduce, possibly to an unsafe value, whilst the vertical speed target value is being obeyed. Note that at higher levels where aircraft are close to their performance limits, this condition can exist with a relatively shallow rate of climb. Similarly, with a sufficiently high rate of descent selected, even with idle power commanded from the engines, the airspeed may increase, possibly to an unsafe value, whilst the vertical speed target value is being obeyed. With Glideslope mode engaged the FD will command the glide-slope signal to be obeyed. The FD will also attempt to attain the airspeed target value, but if this is unattainable the FD will continue to obey the glide-slope command and will not command corrections to attain the airspeed target. This means that if a sufficiently strong tailwind exists, even with idle power commanded from the engines, the airspeed will increase, possibly to an unsafe value, whilst the glide-slope descent angle is being obeyed. Similarly, should the power from the engines be insufficient (e.g. if a fault commands idle power), the FD will command an ever increasing angle of attack in order to maintain the glide-slope and the airspeed will therefore decrease, possibly to an unsafe value.
