Prevention is better than the Cure. For extended periods of flight with reduced power settings, the power should be routinely increased and FULL carburettor heat applied for around 15 seconds to ensure that the engine stays sufficiently warm to melt any ice. If flying in conditions that appear conducive to the development of carburettor ice, carburettor heat should be applied at regular intervals as both a preventative measure against the formation of ice and a method to test whether or not carburettor ice is developing. If a normal drop in RPM or manifold pressure accompanies the application of carburettor heat, it is reasonably certain that ice is not forming in the carburettor. Butâ€¦ The use of carburettor heat will decrease engine performance by up to 15% so pilots should beware of flying around with it continuously selected; the aircraft will use more fuel than planned for and this practice could potentially decrease the life of the engine due to an inappropriate mixture setting. Best Practice Review the difference between the OAT and the Dew Point when obtaining your meteorological briefing.. Monitor the OAT gauge fitted to the aircraft. Monitor the carburettor mixture temperature gauge (if fitted). Monitor the carburettor air inlet temperature gauge(if fitted). Conduct a carburettor heat ground check immediately prior to take-off. Use carburettor heat when operating within the icing range. Use carburettor heat on approach and descent. Remember that, as a rule-of-thumb: Power OFF = Carb Heat ON
