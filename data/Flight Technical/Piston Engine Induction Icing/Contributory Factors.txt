Carburettor icing depends on atmospheric conditions, the fuel in use and the detailed design of the carburettor. There is no scientific justification for a diagram which seeks to represent the dependency of carburettor icing on any one of those three factors without reference to the other two. The question is whether the deposition of a small amount of ice causes sufficient distortion of the flow of air into the carburettor that further deposition of ice becomes more likely. Clearly this depends on the detailed geometry of the air intake, as well as atmospheric conditions.. Outside air temperatures in the ranges above combined with moist conditions are ideal for the formation of carburettor ice.. All aircraft types/fuel combinations can have slightly different characteristics associated with engine icing; an aircraft operating on AVGAS will have different characteristics to the same type operating on Motor Gasoline. Pilots should know and understand what happens to their particular aircraft/fuel combination in various flight conditions..
