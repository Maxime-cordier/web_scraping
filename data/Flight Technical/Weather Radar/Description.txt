Airborne weather radar is a type of radar used to provide an indication to pilots of the intensity of convective weather. Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Typically, the radar antenna is located in the nose of the aircraft. Signals from the antenna are processed by a computer and presented on a screen which may be viewed by the pilots. Droplet size is a good indicator of strong updrafts within cumulonimbus clouds, and associated turbulence, and is indicated on the screen by patterns, colour coded for intensity. Some airborne weather radar systems may also be able to predict the presence of wind shear.
