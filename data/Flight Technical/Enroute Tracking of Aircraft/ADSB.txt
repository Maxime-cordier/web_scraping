It is widely recognised that ADS-B will eventually become the preferred surveillance technology worldwide, although this will take time. ICAO, at Air Navigation Commission 11 (ANC11) in 2007 resolved that “ICAO and States recognize ADS-B as an enabler of the global ATM operational concept bringing substantial safety and capacity benefits.” A further development of the ADS-B technology is using satellites to relay the signals from aircraft in areas where ground equipment installation is either impossible or is not feasible. This extension is called space-based ADS-B. The key features of ADS-B (and space-based ADS-B) are: ADS-B is an air to air, air to ground autonomous surveillance application;. ADS-B has been in use since the mid to late 1990’s;. Reception of existing ADS-B transmissions at satellites is planned;. Satellite reception does not change or impact on existing RF environment;. No changes required to aircraft avionics or certification with the introduction of space-based ADS-B;. Space-based ADS-B is mainly intended for oceanic, polar and remote regions..
