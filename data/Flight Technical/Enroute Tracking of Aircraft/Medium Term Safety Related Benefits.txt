A number of benefits can be expected from the deployment of space-based ADS-B in the medium term, including: Improved service in remote and difficult-terrain regions. Improved cooperation in contingency management. Greater interoperability (an ICAO harmonization enabler). Support for conflict zone and volcanic ash cloud management. Improved regional and local data sharing. Reduced risk of controlled flight into terrain.
