There are some important topics that must be addressed to ensure the realisation of the many safety and efficiency benefits of space-based ADS-B, the most notable of them being: Regulatory framework. Space-based ADS-B will require state regulatory approval. The requirements to the aircraft and ground-based elements are not considered as a barrier but they are important regulatory safety processes that must be completed.. Equipage rates. To derive the benefits of any new technology requires a level of momentum and a point at which the level of participation enables the full benefits to be realised. A number of states have already mandated or are instituting mandates for the adoption of ADS-B over the coming years.. Quality of signal and impact of antennae location on the aircraft. The modelling for space-based ADS-B is based on top-mounted antennae, which is consistent with the positioning of TCAS (traffic-alert and collision avoidance system) equipment of an aircraft. The evaluation of system and signal reliability, availability and latency will need to be part of the certification and approval processes to meet regulatory requirements.. Adoption by ANSPs. The implementation of space-based ADS-B will require some ANSPs to procure new or upgrade existing ATC automation systems.. Security. Space-based ADS-B is likely to be subject to security-related research, given its likely central role in aircraft tracking and SAR support..
