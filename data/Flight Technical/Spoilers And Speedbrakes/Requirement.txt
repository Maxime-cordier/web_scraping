Aircraft are designed to be as aerodynamically "clean" as possible and drag is minimized as much as practical to improve performance and decrease fuel consumption. A side effect of this aerodynamic success is that, even at idle thrust, an aircraft does not tend to slow down quickly, especially when descending. High performance military aircraft have long used speedbrakes, interchangeably referred to as air brakes or dive brakes, to control speed during rapid descent or to quickly reduce speed during level flight. Early commercial aircraft types utilised extension of the undercarriage to provide additional drag when required. However, due to the altitude limitations of the landing gear and the the normally transient requirement for the addtional drag, this was not considered an optimum solution. In time, speedbrakes and spoilers were incorporated into commercial aircraft design.
