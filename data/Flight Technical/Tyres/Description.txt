Aircraft tyres are designed to withstand extremely heavy loads for short durations, with the number of tyres required increasing with the weight of the plane in order to better distribute the weight. Aircraft tyre tread patterns are designed to facilitate stability in high crosswind conditions, to channel water away to prevent aquaplaning, and for braking effect. Some types of nose wheel tyres include one (or two) chine moulded into the rubber on the shoulder buttresses that deflects water away during aircraft movement on a wet runway. Aircraft tyres also include heat fuses (sometimes called fusible plugs) which are designed to melt at a certain temperature in order to reduce the risk of an explosive deflation due to overheating.
