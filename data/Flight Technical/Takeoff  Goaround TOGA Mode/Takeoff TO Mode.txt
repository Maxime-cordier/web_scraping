During take-off, pressing the TO/GA switch or advancing the thrust levers to the TO/GA position will command the engines to increase their RPM to the calculated N1 or engine pressure ratio (EPR). Many modern aircraft are capable of carrying out a Reduced Thrust Takeoff in which the power needed by the engines for take off is pre-determined by the crew based on a number of factors such as runway length, wind speed, temperature, and the weight of the aircraft. At the thrust reduction altitude (minimum of 400' AGL) the thrust is reduced, either by manual selection of the thrust lever position or by selection of an appropriate vertical mode on the Mode Control Panel (MCP) or manufacturer equivalent. One of the advantages of having such a system during take-off is the ability to reduce wear and tear on the engines by only using as much power as is actually required to meet takeoff and climb obstacle clearance criteria.
