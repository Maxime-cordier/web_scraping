If installed, the TO/GA switches are usually located on the thrust levers. The switch is the same for both take-off (TO) and go-around (GA) modes. By pressing the TO/GA switches when autothrottle is engaged, the thrust lever servo-actuators are activated and they advance the thrust levers at a preset rate in order to reach the position for take-off or go-around. On aircraft in which the TO/GA mode is selected manually such as current Airbus types, the thrust levers must be moved to the TO/GA detent (usually full forward) by the pilot flying.
