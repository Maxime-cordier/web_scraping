A HUD - Head Up Display - is a means of presenting information to the pilot within their direct line of external forward vision. The HUD overhead unit projects key flight instrument data onto a small transparent display screen (combiner) which is positioned just in front of the pilot within their line of sight as they look ahead through the windscreen. For a complete description, refer to the SKYbrary article Head Up Display.
