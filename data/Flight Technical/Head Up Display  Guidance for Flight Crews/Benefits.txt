In transport category aircraft, the primary benefit of a HUD system is the enhancement of situational awareness for flight in limited (or night) visibility in the vicinity of visible terrain, water, ground-based obstacles or other aircraft. This is because the pilot is able to maintain an external lookout without losing access to key aircraft instrumentation. This is especially true for the approach and landing phase of flight, where the majority of all aircraft accidents — and the majority of fatal Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) accidents to public transport aircraft — occur. The Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) study, Head-up Guidance System Technology — A Powerful Tool for Accident Prevention, looked at 1079 civil jet transport accidents that occurred between 1959 and 1989, before HUDs were prevalent. It concluded that if a HUD had been fitted and operated by properly trained flight crews, it might have prevented or positively influenced 33% of total loss accidents and 29% of ‘major partial loss’ accidents. The FSF Approach-and-Landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) Task Force recommended that both airlines and business-jet operators install HUDs that display angle of attack and airspeed trend data to improve flight crew awareness of the energy state of their aircraft. To achieve these benefits, the HUD must be utilised as intended and flight crews must be appropriately trained, practiced and proficient in its use. The IFALPA Position Paper "Head-Up Display (HUD) and Vision Systems" provides a comprehensive list of those HUD-related training items that should be considered during initial and recurrent training. This article is intended to provide some practical guidance in the use of a Head Up Display. In all cases, the specific guidance, as provided by the manufacturer, takes precedence over any information presented in this article.
