The basic purpose of the EEC is to optimise flight performance while protecting each engine and the aircraft against safety risks. Later-generation EECs, with electronic controls, meter fuel more precisely and sense/process more engine operating parameters to adjust fuel metering than early EECs with mechanical fuel control — improving fuel economy, flight crew workload and engine reliability. Regulators oversee manufacturers’ designs of EEC digital hardware, software and networks to ensure compliance with certification criteria, including high standards in manufacturing processes and certified software build. Aircraft accident and incident investigators may include analysis of recorded EEC data, searching for faults that reveal any disparity between commanded engine power and achieved engine power.
