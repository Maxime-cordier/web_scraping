The effects which could result from the threats, as listed above, range from minor to potentially catastrophic depending upon the circumstances of the occurrence and the type of battery involved. As examples: leakage from a spillable lead acid battery could result in corrosion, component damage or injury.. overcharging of a lead acid battery could result in an explosion. Overcharging, excessive charge rate or excessive discharge rate in a lithium-ion battery could result in a thermal runaway leading to battery explosion or fire. This, in turn, could lead to injury or death and collateral damage up to the potential loss of the aircraft.. while technically not a battery fault, a problem on an associated "hot" battery bus bar could result in fumes, smoke or fire..
