Mitigation of most of the threats associated with aircraft batteries can be achieved through robust design, testing, maintenance and operational practices and procedures. These include: Aircraft Design. Procedures for the Certification of aircraft and their equipment should involve validation of their safety when malfunctioning such as battery containment commensurate with internal pressure and/or venting of hazardous fumes and substances which may occur.. New Technologies. Certification must pay particular attention to new technologies, especially where their development or transfer to aircraft and their equipment is rapid.. Maintenance Practices. Should follow the regulatory requirements and manufacturers' guidance in respect of inspection, recharging, removal and replacement criteria.. Flight Crew Procedures. Should take full account of manufacturers' direction on normal, abnormal and emergency system usage and monitoring.. AOM/Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) Guidance. Should provide clear, unambiguous information on system limitations and on the actions to be followed in the event of an exceedance or malfunction..
