In older aircraft, control is achieved through the pilot's control column, rudder pedals, trim wheel or throttles that mechanically move cables, pulleys or hydraulic servo valves which in turn move control surfaces or change engine settings. Many newer aircraft replace these mechanical controls with fly-by-wire systems. These aircraft have flight control computers which send electronic signals to operate control surfaces or engine controls, inform the pilot and provide performance information. In older aircraft the pilot's mechanical controls are resisted by the forces acting on the control surface, but nothing prevents the aircraft from stalling, over-speeding or an excessive bank angle at high speed. Fly-by-wire systems limit control surface movements to ensure that aircraft limits are not exceeded. Aircraft designers have created a set of flight control modes that include redundant electronics to safeguard against system failures. Failures can occur singly or in combination to render systems inoperative. Pilots must be able to control the aircraft with any or all of the fly by wire protections and control enhancement not functioning. Airbus control law logic allows for a progressive degradation of automatic protections until multiple failures result in an unprotected, direct mode of operation. Limited mechanical control modes are also available to allow continued aircraft control during the reset process following a transient loss of all flight control computers. Boeing's direct mode removes many of the computational 'limitations'. Another function of flight control laws is to assess the performance of the aircraft under various conditions, such as takeoff, landing or normal cruise when flight control computers partially or completely fail. Designers build in the ability to by-pass the computers or for the standby systems to operate without the computers.
