A Gyromagnetic compass system comprises: A magnetic detector (flux valve) which electronically senses the horizontal component of the earthâ€™s magnetic field;. A turn/accelerator cut out switch which cuts out the feed from the flux valve to the gyro during turns and acceleration;. A gyroscope which maintains its position reference and continues to point in the same direction regardless of what the aircraft does;. Compass repeaters to transmit heading information to the associated instruments;.
