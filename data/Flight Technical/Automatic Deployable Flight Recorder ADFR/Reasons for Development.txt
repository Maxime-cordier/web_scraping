Obtaining flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) content as quickly as possible after an aircraft accident is crucial in determining the causes and contributing factors, and, more importantly, in developing safety recommendations to prevent similar accidents. Some historic accidents and more recent events — such as the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in 2014 and the crash into the Atlantic Ocean of Air France Flight 447 in 2009 — have shown that in some accident scenarios, timely recovery of these flight recorders proved to be impossible. When an accident occurs in a remote area, over water or at an unknown location, recovering the flight recorders can be a significant challenge. Therefore, the development of deployable flight recording systems (DFRS) for commercial aircraft has begun.
