The 2020 clash over radio altimeter interference echoes a U.S. controversy in 2011–2012. In that case, a startup U.S. company (LightSquared) leased radio spectrum and began to construct satellite-based and ground infrastructure for broadband mobile technology. Aviation experts and telecommunications experts hotly debated whether the proposed system would cause RF interference to global navigation satellite system signals that could not be mitigated. Ultimately, the FCC — which had “clearly stated from the outset [of LightSquared’s proposal] that harmful interference to GPS [global positioning system signals] would not be permitted” — stated that it would not lift an earlier order that prohibited LightSquared’s commercial operations “unless harmful interference issues were resolved.”
