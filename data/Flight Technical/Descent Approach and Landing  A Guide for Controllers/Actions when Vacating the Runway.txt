When vacating a runway, if the aircraft has simply ‘crossed’ the runway the only required action may be to switch off the strobe lights. When vacating a runway after landing however, this often involves many actions to be accomplished as part of the ‘after landing scan’. Add to this the need to change radio frequency, the receipt of taxi clearance and the need to check the taxi route on the aerodrome charts, then it can be seen that the PM in particular, and also possibly PF, becomes very much ‘heads down’ and is unable to appropriately monitor the taxiing of the aircraft and to maintain situational awareness. Common actions when entering or vacating a runway are the selection of the aircraft’s exterior lights and selection of the transponder and the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). These may be the only actions required depending on the situation, however, these (simple) actions still constitute the situation of one, or possibly both, crew members being ‘heads down’. When vacating a runway after landing the many (additional) items can include those associated with the flaps, speed-brake, auto-brake and weather radar. How the crew plan the descent;. How direct routings affect the descent profile;. How speed restrictions affect the descent profile;. How the crew manage being high or low on the descent;. How the crew manage Continuous Descent Approaches;. How wind affects the descent;. How weather affects the descent;. Did the controller contribute to making the aircraft too high/low? If so, how?. How early/late the autopilot is disconnected and the PF takes over manually. The margins that the crew have for stabilising the approach considering the approach criteria (e.g. maintain 160 knots to 4 miles). Return to Flight Deck Procedures - A Guide for Controllers
