The Navigation Display provides the pilot with a lateral overview of the flight and essentially provides navigational and weather information. Therefore it will show items such as waypoints, airports, the route ahead and TCAS information. Weather data is mainly based on the weather radar and is overlaid on the display. Different colours are used to denote the intensity of the weather. Just like the Primary Flight Display, the Navigation Display may change the shape and colour of data to alert the pilot to a hazard. Warnings are often accompanied by audible alerts.
