The displays on the flight deck are controlled via one or more control panels that allow the crew to view the data in a suitable format. As an example, the pilots may choose a larger range on the Navigation Display to view a distant weather system. In case of a display failure the pilots can chose to view the data on another display. Alternatively the system may automatically display a condensed image on a single display.
