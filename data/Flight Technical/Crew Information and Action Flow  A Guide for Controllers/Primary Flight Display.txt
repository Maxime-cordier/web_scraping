The Primary Flight Display provides the pilot with basic flight data such as aircraft attitude, heading, speed, vertical speed and level. It also has the capability of alerting the pilot to any potentially hazardous conditions, such as low airspeed, high airspeed and high rate of descent by altering the colour and shape of the relevant data. Warnings are often accompanied by audible alerts. On many modern aircraft the Primary Flight Display will provide the pilots with pitch instructions in case of a TCAS Resolution Advisory.
