Following a landing gear malfunction on takeoff, the crew was unable to raise the gear. Manufacturerâ€™s procedures were correctly followed and the decision was taken to divert to land at an enroute airport using the FMS fuel predictions. During the transit, it was determined that fuel was being consumed at a greater rate than expected and that the FMS fuel prediction at destination was falling. A closer diversion was selected; however, both engines flamed out due to fuel starvation before arrival causing the loss of the aircraft.
