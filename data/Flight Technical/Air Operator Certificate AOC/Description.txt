An AOC, sometimes alternatively described as an Air Operator Permit, is the approval granted from a national aviation authority (National Aviation Authority (NAA) to an aircraft operator to allow it to use aircraft for commercial purposes. This requires the operator to have personnel, assets and systems in place to ensure the safety of its employees and the general public. This document will as a minimum detail the aircraft types which may be used, for what purpose and in what geographic region. "... prior to commencing commercial air operations, the operator shall apply for and obtain an air operator certificate (AOC) issued by the competent authority." (IR-OPS ORO.AOC.100 Application for an air operator certificate) An operator shall not operate an aeroplane for the purpose of commercial air transportation otherwise than under, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of an Air Operator Certificate (AOC). (EU-OPS 1.175 (a)) IR-OPS ORO.AOC (EU-OPS 1.175) details the general rules for Air Operator Certification. An AOC specifies the: (a) Name and location (principal place of business) of the operator; (b) Date of issue and period of validity; (c) Description of the type of operations authorised; (d) Type(s) of aeroplane(s) authorised for use; (e) Registration markings of the authorised aeroplane(s) except that operators may obtain approval for a system to inform the Authority about the registration markings for aeroplanes operated under its AOC; (f) Authorised areas of operation; (g) Special limitations; and (h) Special authorisations/approvals e.g.: CAT II/CAT III (including approved minima).
