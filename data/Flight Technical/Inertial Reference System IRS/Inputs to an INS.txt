Although an INS is essentially a “self-contained” navigation system, it does perform better when provided with some data inputs. These may include: Initial Position: as the “shut-down” position will undoubtedly carry some error.. GPS Position: bounding the INS position error.. Barometric Altitude: helps to stabilise the vertical velocity and inertial altitude outputs.. True Air Speed (TAS): allows for the calculation of Wind Speed and Direction..
