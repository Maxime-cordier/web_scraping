An inverter is an electrical device that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). The converted AC can be at any required voltage and frequency with the use of appropriate transformers, switching, and control circuits. Solid-state inverters have no moving parts and are used in a wide range of applications including aircraft. Inverters are commonly used to supply AC power from DC sources such batteries.
