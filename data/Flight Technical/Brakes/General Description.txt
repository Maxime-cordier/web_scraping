Aircraft brakes, for land based aircraft, are almost exclusively located on the main wheels although there have been some aircraft over the years which have also had nose wheel brakes. Operation of the brakes has evolved from a single lever applying all brakes symmetrically, to heel operated pedals, to toe operated brake controls incorporated into the rudder pedals. With the foot operated controls came the ability to apply left or right brakes independently allowing use of differential braking to steer the aircraft during ground operations and to maintain directional control during that portion of the takeoff or landing roll when the airspeed is too low for the aerodynamic controls to be effective. In early aircraft, transmission of the brake control input to the braking device was mechanical - most often through cables. This was inefficient and could only be effectively used in small aircraft. The solution was to develop hydraulically activated brakes and this remains the standard on the vast majority of aircraft flying today. In small aircraft, the system can be powered by a master cylinder and does not need hydraulic pumps. In larger aircraft, pumps are required to provide the necessary hydraulic fluid pressure and volume. In the continuing quest to develop lighter, more efficient aircraft, electrically activated brakes are starting to come into service on some of the newest generation passenger aircraft.
