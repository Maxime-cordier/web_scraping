If it is considered or suspected that the brakes (and therefore the adjacent tyres) may be unduly hot after take off, then the following precautions may be prudent in order to allow the components time to cool: Leave the gear down for an extended period after take-off having considered any effect this will have on climb performance. If at all possible, avoid making a landing very soon after take-off. Follow the AFM limitations for minimum ground cooling periods after heavy braking. This would especially apply after a high speed Rejected Take Off.. Leave the gear down for an extended period after take-off having considered any effect this will have on climb performance..

This would especially apply after a high speed Rejected Take Off.. Always consider whether Hot Brake incidents should be attended by fire crews.. Confine all significant braking to times when the aircraft is travelling in a straight line to avoid tyre stress and undue wear. Ensure that brakes are never applied against forward thrust or power while the aircraft is moving. Avoid high power settings against the brakes while the aircraft is stopped unless conducting required checks or procedures such as an engine runup.. Do not inadvertently 'ride' the toe brakes whilst taxying.
