Windshield wipers are the most common rain protection feature. Most of them use electrical motors but some aircraft may be equipped with hydraulic wiper motors. Usually the pilot’s and copilot’s windshield wipers are operated by separate systems to ensure that clear vision is maintained through one of the windows should one system fail. Each windshield wiper assembly consists of a wiper, wiper arm, and a wiper motor/converter. In many cases, windshield wiper systems will have limiting airspeed, above which they must not be operated. This limitation is due to the increased slipstream loading on, and the potential of damage to, the wiper assembly at higher speeds. In general, the wipers are used during ground operations, for takeoff, during the final stages of the approach and for landing. In many aircraft designs, the geometry of the windshield limits the arc and sweep of the wiper blade resulting in only a relatively small segment of the windshield being cleared. The systems also can be quite noisy and some pilots find them distracting. For these reasons, many pilots will only use the wipers in conditions of heavy rain.
