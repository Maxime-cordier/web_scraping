Annexes 1, 6, 8, 11, 13 and 14 include the requirement for States to establish a State Safety Programme (SSP), in order to achieve an acceptable level of safety in civil aviation. An SSP is a systematic approach to the management of safety by the State. An SSP is defined as an “integrated set of regulations and activities aimed at improving safety”, and comprises specific safety activities that must be performed by the State in order to fulfil its responsibilities concerning safe and efficient delivery of aviation activities in the State, including: a) safety oversight; b) safety data collection, analysis and exchange; and c) safety-data-driven targeting of oversight of areas of greater concern or need. Further, the same Annexes establish that States shall require, as part of their SSP, that aircraft operators and service providers (including an ATS) implement an SMS which shall “include the continuous monitoring and regular assessment of the safety performance”. The ICAO Safety Management Manual (ICAO Doc 9859) clarifies that safety performance measurement is “a non-stop activity, involving continuous monitoring and measurement, by an organization, of selected operational activities that are necessary to deliver the services the organization was constituted to deliver (provision of aerodrome services, air traffic control, training, etc.)”.
