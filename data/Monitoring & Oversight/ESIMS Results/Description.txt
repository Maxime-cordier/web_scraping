The ESARR Implementation Monitoring and Support (ESIMS) Programme was introduced in its mature form in 2005 to assess, through a formal and detailed audit process, Statesâ€™ safety oversight arrangements and capabilities. It was operated in close, formal cooperation with the ICAO Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme (IUSOAP). The ESIMS Programme came to an end in 2012 being succeeded by the EASA standardisation inspections. ESIMS audits' results and updates thereto were published on a regular basis by the EUROCONTROL Safety Regulation Commission (SRC) within the scope of its SRC Annual Safety Reports, posted on the EUCONTROL SRC website. Examples of results published in 2010 are shown below.
