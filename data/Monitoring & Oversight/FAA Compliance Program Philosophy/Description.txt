The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Compliance Program, which was originally launched in 2015 as the Compliance Philosophy, is intended to serve as the “overarching guidance” for implementing FAA’s strategic safety oversight approach to meeting the challenges of the changing aerospace system, according to FAA documentation. The name was changed in October 2018 “to reflect the advanced integration of these concepts into the fabric of the agency’s mission.” The Compliance Program is part of FAA’s risk-based decision-making strategic initiative, and uses consistent, data-informed approaches to enable FAA to make what it calls “smarter, system-level, risk-based decisions.” This approach to compliance also serves to further the agency’s evolution toward a “Just Culture,” which has both an expectation of, and an appreciation for, self-disclosure of error.
