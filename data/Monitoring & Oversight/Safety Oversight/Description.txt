Safety Oversight forms the part of the safety regulatory process dedicated to ensuring that applicable safety regulatory requirements are met, and to the monitoring of the safe provision of services. Unless prescribed otherwise by international legislation, safety oversight in aviation is a national responsibility. Many States and safety experts advocate moving to a form of Safety Oversight referred to as Risk-based Oversight.
