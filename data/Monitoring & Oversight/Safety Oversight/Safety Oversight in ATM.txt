In Air Traffic Management (ATM), specific legal provision have been made at European level for the establishment of national safety oversight functions. Regulation 1034/2011 - Safety Oversight in ATM and Air Navigation Services of 17 October 2011 on safety oversight function by competent authorities concerning air navigation services (ANS), air traffic flow management (ATFM), airspace management (ASM) for general air traffic and other network functions. The Regulation does not cover military operations and training. This Regulation applies to the activities of competent authorities and qualified entities acting on their behalf regarding the safety oversight of ANS, ATFM, ASM and other network functions. Regulation 1034/2011 was repealed by Regulation 2017/373 which essentially applies (inter alia) to the same activities.
