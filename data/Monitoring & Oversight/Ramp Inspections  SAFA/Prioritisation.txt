Commission Regulation (EC) No 351/2008 of 16 April 2008 implementing Directive 2004/36/EC addresses the prioritisation of ramp inspections on aircraft using Community airports, and requires States to prioritise their ramp inspections on the following subjects (operators and/or aircraft) landing at any of their airports open to international air traffic: Subjects identified as posing a potential safety threat on the basis of the regular analyses conducted by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).. Subjects identified on the basis of an opinion expressed by the Air Safety Committee within the context of the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005 of the European Parliament and the Council (the Community list) that further verification of effective compliance with relevant safety standards through systematic ramp inspections on those subjects is necessary. This may include subjects which have been withdrawn from the list of air carriers subject to an operating ban within the Community established by Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005.. Subjects identified on the basis of information obtained by the European Commission from the Member States or EASA pursuant to Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005.. Aircraft operated into the Community by operators included in Annex B of the Community list.. Aircraft operated by other operators certified in the same State as any operator featuring concurrently on the Community list..
