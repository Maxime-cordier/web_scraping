ICAO launched the USOAP on 1 January 1999 in response to widespread concerns expressed during the 29th ICAO Assembly in 1992. At that Session of the Assembly, a concern was raised on the apparent inability of some Contracting States to carry out their safety oversight functions. Assembly Resolution A32-11 directed ICAO to conduct regular, mandatory, systematic and harmonised safety audits of all Contracting States, with the objective of enhancing safety by promoting the implementation of States of International Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs). It also encouraged its application by Contracting States, together with the greater transparency and increased accessibility of audit results.
