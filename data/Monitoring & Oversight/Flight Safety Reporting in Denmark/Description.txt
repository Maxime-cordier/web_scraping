In 2001, a new law was passed by the Danish Parliament mandating the establishment of a compulsory, strictly non-punitive, and strictly confidential system for the reporting of aviation incidents. A particular and perhaps unusual feature of this reporting system is that not only are employees (typically air traffic controllers and pilots) ensured strict immunity against penalties and disclosure but, also, any breach against the non-disclosure guarantee is made a punishable offence.
