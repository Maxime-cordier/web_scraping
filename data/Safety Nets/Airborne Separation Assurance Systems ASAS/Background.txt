New concepts for air traffic management, such as the ‘Free Flight’ concept, enable the flexible use of airspace by means of airborne determination of user-preferred trajectories thus allowing direct routing. These concepts are aimed at increased airspace capacity and reduced congestion. They may lead, however, to more complex traffic flows and increased controller workload. A solution might be to delegate the separation task to the pilot. Airborne Separation Assurance Systems (ASAS) can assist pilots in such “self-separation”. It is expected that ASAS will be effective, in terms of conflict resolution and reduced workload.
