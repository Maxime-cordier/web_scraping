Recent operational experience confirms the importance of Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) regulation and correct use of related procedures. ACAS procedures and pilot training guidelines are included in ICAO Doc 8168 (PANS-OPS), while those for controllers are contained in ICAO Doc 4444 (PANS-ATM). In Europe, EU-OPS contains provisions for the use of ACAS. The European Safety Programme (ESP) requires, as a high priority, action to be taken by aviation regulatory authorities, air navigation service providers, and airspace users to confirm that these ACAS regulations and procedures are correctly implemented and applied. Every effort must be made to ensure that the relevant operations manuals include up-to-date ACAS procedures, and that appropriate training is provided to ensure that pilots and controllers are able to apply these standard ACAS procedures consistently.
