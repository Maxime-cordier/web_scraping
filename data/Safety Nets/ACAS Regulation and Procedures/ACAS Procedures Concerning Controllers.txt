ICAO Doc 4444 (PANS-ATM), Chapter 15 contains procedures in regard to aircraft equipped with ACAS. Chapter 12 contains the relevant phraseologies. For full information refer to that document. The following are relevant extracts from Chapter 15: When a pilot reports a manoeuvre induced by an ACAS RA, the controller shall not attempt to modify the aircraft flight path until the pilot reports returning "Clear of Conflict".. Once an aircraft departs from its ATC clearance or instruction in compliance with an RA, or a pilot reports an RA, the controller ceases to be responsible for providing separation between that aircraft and any other aircraft affected as a direct consequence of the manoeuvre induced by the RA. The controller shall resume responsibility for providing separation for all the affected aircraft when:. a) the controller acknowledges a report from the flight crew that the aircraft has resumed the current clearance; or b) the controller acknowledges a report from the flight crew that the aircraft is resuming the current clearance and issues an alternative clearance which is acknowledged by the flight crew. Note - The phraseology to be used by controllers and pilots is contained in Chapter 12 (of the same ICAO document).
