The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Honeywell have jointly produced guidance on pilot response to EGPWS warnings as well as recommendations for operators regarding aircraft equipment. Operators are encouraged to consider equipping their aircraft with EGPWS equipment and ensure the use of GPS that feeds direct to EGPWS. Appropriate and clear procedures and pilot training should also be developed. Following an EGPWS alert, flight crew should control the aircraft flight path with immediate maximum Required Obstacle Clearance (ROC) and maximum thrust to clear the obstacles threatening the flight. Climbing is the only recommended response unless operating in visual conditions and/or pilot determines that turning in addition to the climbing is the safest course of action. The document provides supporting information in the form of EGPWS statistics of different warnings and crew response times.
