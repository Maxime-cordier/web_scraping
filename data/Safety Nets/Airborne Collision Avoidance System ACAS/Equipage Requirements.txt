Amendment 85 to ICAO Annex 10 volume IV, published in October 2010, introduced a provision stating that: all new ACAS installations after 1 January 2014 shall be compliant with version 7.1; and. all ACAS units shall be compliant with version 7.1 after 1 January 2017.. On 20 December 2011, the European Commission published an Implementing Rule, subsequently amended on 16 April 2016, mandating the carriage of ACAS II version 7.1 within European Union airspace earlier than the dates stipulated in ICAO Annex 10: by all aircraft with a maximum certified take-off mass exceeding 5,700 kg or authorised to carry more 19 passengers from 1 March 2012;. with the exception of aircraft with an individual certificate of airworthiness issued before 1 March 2012, that must be equipped from 1 December 2015;. aircraft not referred above but which will be equipped on a voluntary basis with ACAS II, must be equipped with version 7.1.. In some parts of the world, notably in the United States, the ACAS equipage mandate is different.
