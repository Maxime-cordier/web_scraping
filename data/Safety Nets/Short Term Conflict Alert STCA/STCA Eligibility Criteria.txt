STCA systems can vary considerably, not least in the rules used to specify which aircraft will be treated by STCA and which aircraft will be ignored. Eligibility criteria can apply to individual tracks, or to track-pair combinations. The criteria that are applied are usually based on the status of the flight plan, but may additionally (or instead) be based upon user-defined SSR code lists (include lists and/or exclude lists). If SSR code lists are used, it is essential that these are kept up to date with the actual operational SSR code allocation policy adopted by the ATC service provider.
