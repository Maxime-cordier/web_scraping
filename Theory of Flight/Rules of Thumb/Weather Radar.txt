You can use the 1 in 60 rule to determine height of weather returns. However, remember the beam width is typically +/- 2 deg. You can measure beam width in flight by looking for the range of the (first) ground return from altitude for a given search angle, e.g.: At 30,000ft, tilt -1 deg, if first ground return is 100 miles, beam width is +/-2 deg (lower edge of the beam is tilted -3 degrees). If you have any other rules of thumb that you find useful then please send the information to the Editor
