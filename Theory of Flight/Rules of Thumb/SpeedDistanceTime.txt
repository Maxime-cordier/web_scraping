Flying speeds that simplify mental arithmetic can help you in many ways, such as keeping retaining situational awareness during radar vectoring. 120Kts = 2nms/min 180Kts = 3nms/min 240Kts = 4nms/min 300Kts = 5nms/min The 1 in 60 rule combined with Speed/Distance/Time assumptions is the basis of many other ‘rules of thumb’ that can be useful in pilot navigation (or to check that an FMS-calculated track makes sence. For example: At 120 kt groundspeed, the aircraft travels 60nm in 30 minutes. A 10 kt wind blows the aircraft 5 nm in 30 minutes At 120 kt groundspeed, a 10 kt crosswind will cause 5 degrees of drift Maximum drift angle (Max Drift) = Windspeed divided by Groundspeed in miles per minute
