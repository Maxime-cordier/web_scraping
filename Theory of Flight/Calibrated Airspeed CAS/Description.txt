CAS has two primary applications in aviation: The first application has rapidly decreased in importance due to the widespread use of GPS and inertial navigation systems. With these systems, pilots are able to read TAS and groundspeed directly from cockpit displays. This negates the requirement to calculate TAS from IAS with calibrated airspeed as an intermediate step. The second application, however, remains critical. As an example, at a given weight, an aircraft will rotate and climb, stall or fly an approach to a landing at approximately the same calibrated airspeeds, regardless of the elevation, even though the true airspeed and groundspeed may differ significantly. These V speeds are normally published as IAS rather than CAS so they can be read directly from the airspeed indicator.
