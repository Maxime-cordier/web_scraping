on the left wing however, the asymmetric blade effect will increase the yaw. Therefore, in the latter case, the left engine is designated as "critical", i.e. its failure being considered to have a more adverse effect. The P-factor is compensated using different methods depending on the aircraft. In the helicopter case, the blades are mounted using hinges that allow them to be adjusted individually througout the rotation cycle. The advancing blade's AoA is reduced and the retreating blade's AoA is increased so that they produce the same amount of lift although moving through the air at different speeds. Designs such as coaxial rotors (e.g. KAMOV Ka-52 or Sikorsky S-69) do not experience adverse effects as each of the rotors compensates the asymmetry of the other. In terms of critical engine, there are three types of two-engine aircraft: Aircraft with a critical engine, where both propellers rotate in the same direction. The critical engine is the one for which the blade that moves down is closer to the fuselage.. Aircraft without a critical engine, where the left engine rotates clockwise and the right engine rotates counter-clockwise. In case of an engine failure, the P-factor will not have a negative impact no matter which engine has failed.. Aircraft where both engines are critical. This means that the left one rotates counter-clockwise and the right - clockwise. An engine failure scenario would likely be aggravated by the additional yaw caused by the P-factor.. In single engine aicraft pilots learn how to compensate the P-factor by using appropriate control inputs.
