There are many different types of drag. The most commonly encountered are: Parasitic Drag, composed of Form Drag, which is the result of the aerodynamic resistance to motion due to the shape of the aircraft, Skin Friction Drag, which is due to the smoothness or roughness of the surfaces of the aircraft, and Interference Drag, which may occur where surfaces with different characteristics meet (e.g. wing and fuselage). Form Drag, which is the result of the aerodynamic resistance to motion due to the shape of the aircraft,. Skin Friction Drag, which is due to the smoothness or roughness of the surfaces of the aircraft, and. Interference Drag, which may occur where surfaces with different characteristics meet (e.g. wing and fuselage). Induced Drag, which is a secondary effect of the production of lift, and. Wave Drag which comes into play when shock waves are developed close to the surface of the aircraft in transonic and supersonic flight..
