The mass of an aircraft and the location of its centre of gravity are vital information required before commencement of any flight. The AFM (AFM) contains critical mass and balance data, for example: Knowing the actual aircraft empty weight and position of its centre of gravity, the passenger and freight load and the planned fuel load, the actual weight of the aircraft and location of is centre of gravity can be calculated for any point in flight. The calculated or actual take-off mass must not exceed: The calculated or actual landing mass must not exceed: The aircraft centre of gravity must at all times remain within the limits specified in the AFM for the relevant stage of flight.
