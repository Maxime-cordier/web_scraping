A supercritical aerofoil is an aerofoil that, principally, has been designed to delay the onset of wave drag in the transonic speed range. Typical features of supercritical aerofoils, when compared to traditional aerofoil shapes, are a flattened upper surface, a highly cambered or curved aft section and greater leading edge radius. Benefits of a supercritical aerofoil include:
