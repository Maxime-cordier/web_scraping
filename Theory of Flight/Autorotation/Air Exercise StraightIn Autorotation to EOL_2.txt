pitch, as necessary, to check the descent and cushion the landing. The yaw pedals are used to maintain heading as collective pitch is raised, due to the reduction in RRPM and the resulting reduced effect of the tail rotor. After touchdown, and after the helicopter has come to a complete stop, the collective lever is lowered to the full-down position. No attempt should be made to try to stop the forward ground run with aft cyclic, as the main rotor blades can strike the tail boom at low RRPM. Rather, by lowering the collective slightly during the ground run, more weight is placed on the undercarriage, slowing the helicopter. To summarise the EOL technique from a steady-state autorotation at the recommended IAS: FLARE (or F-L-A R-E), CHECK (except low inertia rotor systems) LEVEL, and CUSHION.
