A stalled wing may be accompanied by one or more of the following: On all transport aircraft, some form of stall protection system is a certification requirement. Such a system is likely to incorporate stall warning based on the continuous direct measurement of angle of attack moderated by wing configuration in order to enable recovery from an incipient or approaching stall. For aircraft with a conventional control column, this usually includes a stick shaker which provides tactile as well as aural alerting. At the onset of a full stall, most stall protection systems activate a stick pusher to ensure that aircraft pitch attitude (which although it is not directly related to angle of attack varies in the same relative sense) is automatically reduced as an essential component of recovery to safe flight. It is important to note that stall protection systems cannot take account of the possible effects of contaminated aerofoil surfaces and also that any such contamination may not necessarily be symmetrical in respect of the overall aircraft. It should also be noted that on modern Fly-By-Wire aeroplanes, the stall protection system has become part of a wider Flight Envelope Protection System.
