Ozone is poisonous and, in high enough concentrations, can cause headaches, irritation to the respiratory system, and can harm lung function. Aircraft flying above the Tropopause may therefore be flying through air with high concentrations of Ozone. Catalytic converters are fitted to the aircraft air conditioning systems on most modern aircraft to break down the Ozone into harmless Oxygen.
