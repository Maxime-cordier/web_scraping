Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving through random mutations. New mutations can increase or decrease infectiousness and virulence. Several variants have been identified and assigned Greek letter designations by the WHO. Variants are designated as variants of concern (VOC) if they display characteristics like increased transmissability or virulence. Since the beginning of the pandemic, multiple VOCs and variants of interest have been designated by WHO. The Omicron variant, which was first identified in South Africa and is more transmissable than other variants, was designated a VOC in November 2021 and became the dominant variant around the world. Another VOC is the Delta variant, first identified in India, which may cause more severe cases than other variants.
