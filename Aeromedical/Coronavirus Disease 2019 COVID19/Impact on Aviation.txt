In March 2020, as COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world, air transport activity went into a steep decline. The sharp decline in passenger traffic, caused by fears of COVID-19 exposure and government efforts to slow the spread of the disease that included border restrictions and quarantine requirements, resulted in thousands of commercial aircraft being grounded, with many being put into long-term storage. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has called 2020 the worst year in history for air travel demand. For the year, global scheduled passenger traffic, as measured in revenue passenger kilometers, fell by 65.9% and capacity, as measured in available seat kilometers, declined 56.5% from 2019 levels. The total number of domestic and international passenger and cargo flights declined nearly 34% in 2020 from 2019, according to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) statistics. ICAO estimates that 50% fewer scheduled passenger seats were offered in 2020 than in 2019, that there was a 60% reduction in total passengers to 2.7 billion and that airlines lost US$372 billion in gross operating revenues. Air navigation service providers lost US$12.93 billion in navigation charge revenue and airports lost US$114.58 billion, ICAO statistics show. Air travel recovered somewhat in 2021 as more people were vaccinated and consumer confidence increased. However, variant outbreaks had negative impacts on the recovery. ICAO estimates that scheduled passenger seats offered were down 40% in 2021 compared to 2019 and total passengers carried was down 49%. Recovery to pre-pandemic levels is expected to take several years. ICAO has forecast that the number of passengers carried in 2022 will be 26%-31% lower than in 2019. In 2022, air travel continued to recover, although not uniformly across the globe. Worldwide the number passengers in 2022 was down 28-29% from 2019 and airline gross passenger operating revenues were down about US$175 billon. Domestic traffic recovered has outpaced international traffic recovery. Operational issues faced by the aviation industry during the pandemic ranged from quickly and securely parking thousands of aircraft and subsequently bringing many of those aircraft back into service; to the mental, physical and emotional well-being of personnel, the loss of pilot currency and "rustiness" from long periods of not flying, and navigating a disjointed maze of international travel restrictions. A harder to define impact of the pandemic is the loss of tens of thousands of trained and experienced industry personnel through retirements and redundancies. Many in the industry believe that replacing the combined experience and institutional knowledge of those personnel will be difficult and is a risk that needs to be accounted for in safety management systems.
