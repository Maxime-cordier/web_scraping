The Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and Management of Public Health Events in Civil Aviation (CAPSCA) is a voluntary cross-sectorial, multi-organizational collaboration programme managed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) with support from the World Health Organization (WHO). CAPCA was established in 2006 and is intended to bring together international, regional, national and local organisations to combine efforts to improve preparedness planning and response to public health events that affect the aviation sector. Annual multi-sector, multi-stakeholder CAPSCA meetings are held in each of the ICAO regions. During the meetings, the apparoch to public health event management in the aviation sector is developed and harmonized globally. CAPSCA also provides assistance visits to individual States/international airports. In such visits a small team of experts (two or three individuals, ideally including both aviation and public health personnel) visit an airport, usually over two days, and undertake a gap analysis of national/local preparedness plans against the relevant ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SAPRS), the WHO International Health Regulations (2005), which contain articles of relevance to airport and aircraft operators, and associated guidance material. A confidential report is provided that helps the State to develop is preparedness plans.
