Given any particular working environment, regardless of noise levels, communications will be improved by the use of headsets. Typical communications headsets attenuate external noise whilst allowing radio communication to occur; furthermore, speaker volumes can be adjusted when necessary to improve communication. Headsets may either passively or actively reduce external noise: These “muff” style headsets will also protect the users’ inner ears from damage caused by excessive noise, and prolonged exposure to lower levels of noise. Inset-type ear protectors (foam or rubber plugs) only offer protection and do not facilitate better communication.
