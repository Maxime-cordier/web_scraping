Speech intelligibility and communication are vital elements in the safety of civil aviation. A licence holder must be able to transmit and receive verbal instructions to and from the air traffic control system as well as with other crew members. In this particular respect two issues arise: speech intelligibility in noisy surroundings, and. hearing under operational conditions, where many demands are made on attention from multiple sources of importance.. For this reason, licence holders need to meet specific hearing test requirements[1] which are applied during regular medical assessments. These issues may also arise in working environments other than flight decks and air traffic control facilities, such as the Ramp. Furthermore, people providing other services at aerodromes may also experience these physiological aspects, e.g. rescue and fire fighting, de-icing, and wildlife management personnel.
