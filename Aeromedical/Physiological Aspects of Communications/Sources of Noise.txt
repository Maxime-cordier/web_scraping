Engines, propellors and aerodynamic sources constitute the obvious sources of noise, and aircraft design can only have a limited impact on reducing the generation of noise from these sources. However, design can have a larger impact on providing quieter working environments where external noise is attenuated. Noise can also be generated by: The degree of interference will depend upon the relative frequencies and strengths of the voice or tone signal and the ambient noise level. These elements, too, can be designed for quieter operation.
