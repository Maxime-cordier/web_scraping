Shift work almost always causes CRD because the internal biological clock is at odds with the shift pattern, impacting on performance and increasing the risk of accidents and health problems. Shift workers experiencing CRD may experience difficulty falling and staying asleep, increased daytime sleepiness, a general lack of energy in the morning, an increase in energy in the evening or late at night, difficulty concentrating, oversleeping and trouble waking, and increased negative moods. The most debilitating symptom of CRD is Fatigue but people experiencing CRD may also experience insomnia, headaches and digestive system problems. CRD-induced fatigue, as noted, can have physiological and psychological ramifications including increased reaction time, decreased attention, impaired memory, distraction, irritability and indifference. Rapid time zone changes — common amongst flight crews and cabin crews operating long haul routes — cause CRD, which is more commonly referred to as jet lag.
