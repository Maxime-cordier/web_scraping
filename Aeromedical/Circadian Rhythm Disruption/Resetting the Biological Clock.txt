Exposure to daylight: Bright light helps to reset circadian rhythms and increases serotonin levels in the brain, improving well-being and promoting a positive mood.. Physical Activity: To adapt quickly to a new time zone, adopt the sleep and eating patterns of that timezone: Get up at dawn, eat breakfast and get out and exercise in the daylight. If you are tired when you arrive in the new time zone, and go to sleep, then your body will set the circadian rhythms back to the original timezone. (There are occasions when this might be desirable â€” for example if you are returning to the original timezone after a short layover.).
