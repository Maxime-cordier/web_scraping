The long incubation period of many foodborne illnesses tends to cause sufferers to attribute their symptoms to stomach flu. If symptoms occur within 1â€“6 hours after eating the food, it suggests that it is caused by a bacterial or natural toxin, or a chemical, rather than live bacteria. If symptoms occur very rapidly after eating food, i.e. within minutes, then the cause may be a food allergy rather than poisoning.
