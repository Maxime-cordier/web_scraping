With any of the typical common cold symptoms it can be difficult to achieve a restful nightâ€™s sleep. This increases the risk of being affected by tiredness during the working day, and of becoming fatigued during the course of a cold. Both tiredness and fatigue are safety issues for critical workers such as pilots, engineers, cabin crew and air traffic controllers etc. Cold symptoms can be physically uncomfortable and therefore cause distraction and loss of vigilance. Furthermore, cold symptoms can also give rise to mental lethargy, making team interaction, communication, judgement and decision-making difficult. Physical performance can be adversely affected, especially due to feelings of muscle weakness and exacerbated by fatigue and tiredness. Also the losses of sense of smell and taste and a slight impairment in hearing may impact directly on safety at work. Some cold symptoms can lead to temporary deafness, or reduced hearing ability, in one or both ears.
