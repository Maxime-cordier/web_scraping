Common cold symptoms are various and multiple, and include: Sore throat. Mucous build up in the nose (runny nose). Difficulty breathing through the nose (nasal congestion). Discoloured phlegm. Swelling of the sinuses. Sneezing. Coughing. Headache. Tiredness. Muscle aches. Loss of taste and/or appetite. Temporary deafness. Feelings of vertigo. The familiar symptoms that we all associate with a common cold are typically first noticed 2 to 3 days after becoming infected; however, within 24 hours some people may start sneezing, notice a chill feeling and suffer a headache. Severity of symptoms usually peak at 3 to 4 days from infection; however, each infection is different and peopleâ€™s tolerance levels differ. A fever in adults is unlikely to be caused by a common cold, but can occur in young children. Many of the symptoms listed above may also be caused by other illnesses and infections. Therefore, consultation with an appropriate medical professional is advised if you are uncertain that your symptoms are due to a common cold.
