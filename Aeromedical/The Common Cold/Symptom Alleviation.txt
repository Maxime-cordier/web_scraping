There is no cure for the common cold, and a healthy adult patient will recover fully within two weeks, and often within one week i.e. 4 to 5 days after first noticing the symptoms. Alleviation from the multitude of symptoms is best obtained through lots of rest and keeping hydrated. Many over-the-counter medications are available to address specific symptoms, including analgesics for muscle aches, analgesics and antiseptics for sore throats, and nasal decongestants. But none of these will speed up recovery, and the benefits of some may be purely placebo. Aircrew and others with jobs that may influence flight safety should use care selecting over-the-counter cold remedies at the pharmacy. Importantly, these medicines can have some side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and insomnia that are not safe for flying or other aviation-related duties. Therefore, before self-medicating, it is always advisable to consult your Company medical officer, or your home doctor, and inform them of your role at work. Antibiotics are not used to treat a cold, however, colds can occasionally lead to bacterial infections of the middle ear or sinuses. If you suspect an ear or sinus infection you should visit your doctor for assessment as these conditions may improve with antibiotics.
