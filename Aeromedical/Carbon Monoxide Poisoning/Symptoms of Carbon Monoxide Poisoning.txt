It is important for everyone to be aware of the “onset” symptoms of CO poisoning; these are summarised in the following Table. Onset of drowsiness can be very swift, and unless action is taken immediately to decrease exposure and reverse the concentration of CO in the blood (see below), sleep followed by unconsciousness will be inevitable. However, like Hypoxia many of the symptoms of CO poisoning will make it difficult, if not impossible, to self-diagnose. This is a problem because the pilots most at risk from CO poisoning are those flying small piston-powered aircraft, solo. A good example of this is the case of Doctor Robert Frayser who awoke only after his Comanche had ran out of fuel and crashed into a field; he thought he was still in the air[2]!
