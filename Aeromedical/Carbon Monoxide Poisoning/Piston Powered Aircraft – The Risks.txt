Piston powered aircraft produce high concentrations of CO and, by design, carry the highest risk that CO can enter the cabin during flight. Because many of these aircraft are flown solo, the impact from CO ingress can be the most severe. Typically most piston powered aircraft obtain their cabin heating by directing fresh (ram) air over the engine muffler (silencer). If there are any cracks, holes or poorly fitting components in the exhaust system, then CO-rich exhaust gases can enter the cabin. Engine exhaust may also enter the cabin through inadequately sealed firewalls and wheel wells etc. Valid evidence exists from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that CO poisoning is a risk to flight crew and passengers of piston powered aircraft. First there are numerous accident reports, both fatal and non-fatal, including: Secondly, analysis of toxicology samples from fatal U.S. aircraft accidents between 1967 and 1993 showed that at least 360 victims had been exposed to sufficient carbon monoxide before or after the crash to impair their abilities[2]. Note that some CO poisoning occurred post crash (probably due to fire) and that CO poisoning in these cases could not be claimed as the cause of the accident. It is possible that flight crew and passengers on piston powered aircraft have been exposed to low concentrations of CO, and deduced that their symptoms were due to airsickness, fatigue, hypoxia etc. Because, no incapacitation occurred and the symptoms alleviated after removal from exposure, then these incidents have never been reported.
