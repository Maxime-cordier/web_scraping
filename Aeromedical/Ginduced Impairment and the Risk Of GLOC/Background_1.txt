The phenomenon of G-LOC has been recognised since the 1930s but much of the study of it has been undertaken in a military context and not all of the implications of its findings have been fully applied to the somewhat different context of civil flying, much of it undertaken as a leisure activity by pilots with only a private licence and a medical examination standard commensurate with such a licence. Most propeller-driven civil aircraft with a type certificate which permits aerobatic manoeuvres are not specifically designed for aerobatics and have a positive G limit which, provided it is not exceeded, will preclude almost all pilots in good physical health from the risk of suffering significant effects from either G-LOC or A-LOC. However, although there have long been some specialist aerobatic aircraft designed for the civil market, readily available types now include many with higher G loading limits than the previous widespread maximum of +6/-5G as offered by, for example, the early Pitts Specials. The Extra 200 and Extra 300 for example now offer +/- 10G and such capability has materially increased the risk of an encounter with G-induced impairment leading to either G-LOC or A-LOC without any prior alerting through loss of visual acuity. Improvements of older designs - many Pitts Special’s are now cleared for +9/+7.5G and more high performance ex-military types such as the Yak 50 and Yak 55 (both +9/-6G) are also more widely available to pilots who may have limited experience and understanding of the risk posed by some aerobatic manoeuvres. Whilst the accelerometer or ‘G-meter’ (which measures Gz) fitted to all aircraft approved for aerobatic flight fairly accurately records the maximum level of both positive and negative G which has been experienced since it was reset, the priority of flying the aircraft means that many relatively inexperienced pilots do not have the capacity to note the level of G which is registered during particular manoeuvres and may not always be able to deduce where the indicated maximum levels of G are likely to have occurred after a sequence. Very little research on the onset of G-LOC has been conducted using a fully instrumented aerobatic light aircraft but data which supports the existence of a risk which is still not widely understood was gathered for a review carried out in Australia in 1987 after a fatal accident to a Bellanca Decathalon 8KCAB aircraft (+6/-5G) in that country which it was suspected was caused by the effects of G-LOC. Even less research has been undertaken into A-LOC although it is now widely recognised that A-LOC is part of a spectrum of cognitive function impairment in which G-LOC is merely the ultimate stage. The Investigation into a 2011 fatal accident to a Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team Hawk concluded that “the most likely cause of the accident was G-induced impairment (A-LOC) of the pilot leading to flight into terrain”. In this case, it was established that the accident pilot had been exposed to just over 6G with a
