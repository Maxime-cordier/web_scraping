Whilst incidents of G-induced symptoms or impairment followed by successful recovery are relatively common, very few of them have been formally documented, even in military flying. Investigation of fatal accidents in which G-LOC or A-LOC is suspected as the cause are especially difficult because loss of consciousness immediately prior to a crash cannot be demonstrated by a post mortem examination and must instead be established by the rigorous exclusion of all other possibilities.
