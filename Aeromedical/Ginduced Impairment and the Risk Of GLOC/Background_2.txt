time above 3G equivalent to just under 9 seconds as he initiated a steeply-banked climbing turn from low level at high speed. Half way round the turn, pilot pressure on the stick had been sub-consciously relaxed and the aircraft had begun to descend and overbank. An alert from the pilot of a following aircraft in respect of the descent resulted in the wings being rolled level and a pitch up input being made but at the prevailing altitude, these occurred too late to prevent terrain impact. Studies mainly relying on instrumented centrifuges have shown that recovery to normal function after G-LOC typically lasts around 15 seconds which may be long enough to prevent recovery of control of an aircraft before this becomes impossible or terrain impact occurs. Other centrifuge experiments have suggested that recovery from A-LOC is much quicker, beginning within a few seconds of G levels reducing below the relaxed G tolerance of an individual, a level which appears to be around 3.5G when unprotected. Research using both on-aircraft recording and centrifuges has also found that it is common for pilots to have no subsequent recollection of a period of unconsciousness.
