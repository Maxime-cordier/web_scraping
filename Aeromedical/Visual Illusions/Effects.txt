Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) Approach-and-landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) Briefing Note 5.3 — Visual Illusions points out that: "Visual illusions result from the absence of visual references or the alteration of visual references, which modify the pilot’s perception of his or her position (in terms of height, distance and/or intercept angle) relative to the runway threshold." The briefing note continues. "Visual illusions are most critical when transitioning from instrument meteorological conditions (Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC)) and instrument references to visual meteorological conditions (Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC)) and visual references. "Visual illusions affect the flight crew’s situational awareness, particularly while on base leg and during the final approach. "Visual illusions usually induce crew inputs (corrections) that cause the aircraft to deviate from the vertical flight path or horizontal flight path. "Visual illusions can affect the decision process of when and how rapidly to descend from the minimum descent altitude/height (Minimum Descent Altitude/Height)."
