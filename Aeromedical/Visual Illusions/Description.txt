Visual illusions occur when the pilot's eye is deceived into making a faulty assessment of aircraft position or orientation in relation to the external environment. An analysis of 76 approach and landing accidents and serious incidents conducted for the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF), including controlled-flight-into-terrain (Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT)) accidents, worldwide between 1984 and 1997, found that twenty-one percent involved flight crew disorientation or visual illusions, and that poor visibility was a circumstantial factor in 59 percent of the accidents and incidents.
