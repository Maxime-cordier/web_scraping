Fainting can occur when the blood pressure falls suddenly as a person stands up. This drop in blood pressure is called orthostatic hypotension. It is more common in older people, and is the reason for fainting in 1 person in 10 aged 60 years or over who faint. It is a common cause of falls in elderly people. When a person stands up after sitting or lying down, gravity naturally draws the blood down into the legs, reducing blood pressure. Usually, the nervous system counteracts this by making the heart beat faster and narrowing your blood vessels, both of which will stabilise your blood pressure. However, in cases of orthostatic hypotension, something interrupts the process of stabilisation. This means that if a person stands up suddenly, the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, causing them to faint. Some possible causes of orthostatic hypotension are explained below:
