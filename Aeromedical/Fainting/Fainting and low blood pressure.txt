Fainting can occur when the blood pressure falls suddenly as a person stands up. This drop in blood pressure is called orthostatic hypotension. It is more common in older people, and is the reason for fainting in 1 person in 10 aged 60 years or over who faint. It is a common cause of falls in elderly people. When a person stands up after sitting or lying down, gravity naturally draws the blood down into the legs, reducing blood pressure. Usually, the nervous system counteracts this by making the heart beat faster and narrowing your blood vessels, both of which will stabilise your blood pressure. However, in cases of orthostatic hypotension, something interrupts the process of stabilisation. This means that if a person stands up suddenly, the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, causing them to faint. Some possible causes of orthostatic hypotension are explained below: Dehydration (low blood volume). If a person becomes severely dehydrated (where the normal water content of the body is reduced), the amount of fluid in the blood will reduce along with the blood pressure. This will make it much harder for the nervous system to stabilise the blood pressure, increasing your chances of fainting. This can be caused by heavy bleeding, vomiting or diarrhoea.. Diabetes. Untreated diabetes (a condition where there is too much glucose in the blood) causes frequent urination, which can lead to dehydration. Excess glucose in the blood can also damage the nerves that help to regulate your blood pressure.. Medication. Some medicines can cause orthostatic hypotension in some people. These include diuretics, which increase the production and flow of urine from the body, beta-blockers and some types of antidepressants.. Neurological conditions. Some health conditions that affect the nervous system, such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease, can trigger orthostatic hypotension in some people..
