The autonomic nervous system comprises the brain, nerves and spinal cord, and regulates a number of automatic bodily functions, including heart rate and maintenance of blood pressure. Fainting can occur when an external experience or circumstance triggers a temporary malfunction in the autonomic nervous system. The malfunction in the autonomic nervous system causes a drop in an individualâ€™s blood pressure and a reduction in heart rate. This leads to a temporary interruption to blood supply to the brain.
