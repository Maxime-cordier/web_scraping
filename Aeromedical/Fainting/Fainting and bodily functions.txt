Fainting can occur when a bodily function or activity places a sudden strain on the autonomic nervous system. This kind of fainting is called situational syncope. Possible causes of situational syncope include: coughing. sneezing. swallowing. laughing. passing stools. urinating. some physical activities, such as weightlifting, although this could also be a sign of an underlying heart problem (see cardiac syncope, below). Situational syncope may also occur after eating a meal or exercising.
