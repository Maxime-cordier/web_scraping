Few age-related flight skill performance studies have specifically been undertaken on airline pilots although there have been several studies in which a comparison between "expert" (airline) pilots and "novice" (low time, General Aviation) pilots has been done. A number of age-related studies, some of which are listed under "Further Reading" below, have been done on other segments of the pilot population. Although the studies do indicate the anticipated age-related decline in performance, they also have determined that expert pilots had better flight summary scores at baseline and showed less decline over time. In general terms, the studies indicate that: For more specific information, please refer to the articles listed under "Further Reading" below.
