Few age-related flight skill performance studies have specifically been undertaken on airline pilots although there have been several studies in which a comparison between "expert" (airline) pilots and "novice" (low time, General Aviation) pilots has been done. A number of age-related studies, some of which are listed under "Further Reading" below, have been done on other segments of the pilot population. Although the studies do indicate the anticipated age-related decline in performance, they also have determined that expert pilots had better flight summary scores at baseline and showed less decline over time. In general terms, the studies indicate that: The risk of performance degradation increases with increasing age. The number pilots whose level of performance will put them ‘at-risk’ will increase with increasing age. The skill level of "expert" pilots, in general, does not suffer the same degree of decline as "novice" or low experience pilots. In most cases, significant deterioration of professional pilot skills will be detected by a combination of simulator checks, line checks and peer review. Simulator checks provide the best test for cognitive performance. For more specific information, please refer to the articles listed under "Further Reading" below.
