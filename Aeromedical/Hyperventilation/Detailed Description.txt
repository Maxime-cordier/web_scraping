To be more precise hyperventilation is breathing in excess of the metabolic needs of the body. Our “breathing-in” response is triggered by the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) in our system rather than the lack of oxygen. Compare staying under water with a lung full of air to doing the same with completely empty lungs. In the first example we gasp for air on surfacing and our heart is pounding in the chest; in the second example we have no breathlessness on surfacing, we just take a normal breath. When in a physically relaxed state, the amount of CO2 in the blood stimulates the respiratory centre and our breathing rate is stabilised around 12 to 20 breaths per minute. When we undertake physical activity our body cells use more Oxygen and this in turn produces more CO2. This excess CO2 enters the blood and consequently our breathing increases in depth and rate to remove it. If we hyperventilate when not physically exercising, i.e. when sat in the cruise monitoring the aircraft systems, we are not burning-off oxygen and converting it into CO2. The CO2 that is already in the system gets “washed out” by the increased respiration. The lowering of blood CO2 (hypocapnia) gives rise to an increased blood pH (respiratory alkalosis). This is quite a profound chemical change in the body and alkalosis will give rise to a broad-range of symptoms. Affecting both the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system, the immediate effects are increased heart rate, reduced blood pressure, reduced blood flow to the brain due to vasoconstriction and muscle spasms. If the actions described later in this Article are followed, then the breathing and the body quickly return to normal and there should be no long-term damage.
