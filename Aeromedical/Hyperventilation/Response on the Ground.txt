On the ground or below 10,000ft altitude without the presence of smoke and fumes, the treatment for Hyperventilation involves restoring the proper CO2 level in the body. Breathing normally is both the best prevention and the best cure for Hyperventilation. In addition to slowing the breathing rate, breathing into a paper bag or talking aloud helps to overcome Hyperventilation. Recovery is usually rapid once the breathing rate is returned to normal.
