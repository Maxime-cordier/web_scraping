It is possible to become familiar with some of the early onset symptoms of Hyperventilation by voluntarily breathing several deeps breaths at an accelerated rate. It is important to consult a doctor/medic before attempting this. If you are permitted to conduct this exercise, then certain precautions should be taken for your own safety. Never conduct this exercise by yourself – have someone monitor you.. Never conduct this whilst working, driving, operating any machinery or when flying!. Sit down before you start and ensure that you won’t fall.. As soon as you have experience several mild symptoms, return to your normal rate of breathing.. Only stand up when you are certain that all symptoms of dizziness and muscle weakness have dissipated.. Becoming familiar with the early warnings that your own body experiences can reduce the chance of you missing the symptoms should they occur in-flight.
