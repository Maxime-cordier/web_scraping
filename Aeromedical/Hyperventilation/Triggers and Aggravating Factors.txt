Basically, anything physical, mental, emotional or environmental that causes the breathing rate and/or depth to increase without an equivalent increase in physical activity can cause hyperventilation. More common reasons for pilots hyperventilating include: Each of these can cause (unconsciously as well as consciously) anxiety or fear, activating the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) leading to Hyperventilation. Furthermore, a pilot experiencing any of these events may be too distracted to notice any symptoms, or may dismiss the symptoms as something “to be expected under the circumstances” and therefore nothing to worry about. The cockpit and cabin environment can also trigger Hyperventilation. Increased levels of Carbon Monoxide and exposure to toxic substances are both triggers. Also, when the level of Oxygen is reduced significantly, this can lead to hyperventilation. Hypoxia definitely will lead to hyperventilation. The signs and symptoms of hypoxia and hyperventilation overlap significantly and are easily confused. It is essential that if a pilot suspects he/she has symptoms of hyperventilation he instead takes action as though he/she is hypoxic!
