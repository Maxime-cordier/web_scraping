In layman’s terms, Hyperventilation can be described as excessive over-breathing. Over-breathing can occur from an increased rate or depth of breathing (or both together). This is how a person may describe another who is hyperventilating, or starting to hyperventilate: panting – rapid shallow breathing – gulping – choking – constant deep breathing – hiccupping. It can be distressing to see someone gasping for air, so an observer may not be able to use such precise adjectives! Some of the other symptoms described below (Signs and Symptoms) may also be visible to an observer but, without a visible or audible connection to excessive breathing, an observer may not connect them as anything to do with hyperventilation.
