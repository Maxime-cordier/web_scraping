Everyone on Earth is exposed to constant background galactic and solar Cosmic Radiation and occasionally additional exposure due to single events, such as solar flare activity. At higher altitudes the protective element of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere is reduced and therefore pilots and aircraft systems are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation[6].
