Most parties involved in the ongoing debate support further scientific research into the matter and improved, standardised reporting of the occurrence and response to fume events. There also have been calls for the installation of air quality monitoring equipment on aircraft, compliance with appropriate maintenance procedures to avoid situations such as overfilling of engine and APU oil and to maintain seals, the use of less toxic oils and other fluids, and a move away from bleed air systems. Labour organisations encourage their members to learn to recognise fume events, and to respond to and report the presence of fumes in the aircraft air supply. Precision in reporting is considered important to helping to identify the source of fumes. These organisations also provide guidance on post-event response and actions to be taken, including coordinated reporting and medical examinations. In March 2022, legislation known as the Cabin Air Quality Act of 2022, was introduced in the Congress. One of the bill's sponsors said at the time that the legislation is intended to protect commercial airline passengers adn crew from toxic cabin air. The bill, if passed in its original state, would require that pilots, flight attendants and aircraft maintenance technicians receive training on identifying toxic smoke and fumes.It also would require FAA to record and monitor reports of smoke or fume events, authorize FAA to conduct investigations into such events and direct carriers to install and operate onboard detectors and other air quality monitoring equipment.
