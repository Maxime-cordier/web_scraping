The following activities can be implemented by air operators in order to reduce the risks of pilots reacting inappropriately to spatial disorientation: aviation medicine training to include understanding of the vestibular system. human factors training to include understanding of the causes of all forms of spatial (and visual) disorientation. safety information discussions to include those accidents and incidents attributed to spatial disorientation. SOPs for recovery from any suspected case of spatial disorientation. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for flight instrument scanning, flight display management, cross-checking and monitoring, for all phases of flight. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure adequate briefing of critical phases of flight (departure, descent, approach and landing) to also include contingency measures in case of unforeseen event, such as balked landing. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for flying, managing and monitoring, stabilised approaches. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) always favouring instrument approaches in preference to visual approaches, and perhaps even banning night visual approaches. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for flying, managing and monitoring go-arounds. where possible, exposure to disorienting conditions in the flight simulator, and practicing recovery SOPs. safety reporting system that encourages self-reporting of human factors, including spatial disorientation. regular refresher training that covers all elements discussed above.. Concerning the issue of self-reporting, there may be some resistance from pilots who fear that they will lose their medical category; hence the need for effective education, and possibly an anonymous reporting system.
