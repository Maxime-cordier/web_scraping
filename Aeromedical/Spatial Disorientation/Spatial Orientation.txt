Spatial orientation is the ability to perceive motion and three-dimensional position (for pilots we could include the fourth dimension – time) in relation to the surrounding environment. Humans (and most animals) are able to achieve this by automatic, subconscious, integration of multiple sensory inputs, such as: the key senses of sight and hearing provide broad peripheral awareness as well as focused attention on details. pressure and touch, through the somatosensory system (the whole body) provide proprioception, and. the vestibular system in the inner ear provides three-dimensional movement and acceleration sensation.. There are three aspects to spatial ‘’position’’ orientation: knowing where the extremity of our body and limbs is. knowing what is up, down, left and right, and. knowing our position in relation to our immediate environment.. This is then complicated by factoring in, for each aspect, awareness of direction of movement, change in direction, speed of movement and change of speed. This automatic system and process has evolved to help us run, walk, sit, stand, hunt, climb, balance etc. and, it even provides for stabilised eyesight (our most convincing sense) whilst doing all these things. This system even works when one or more sensory inputs are degraded. Such that many blind, deaf, and disabled people are also able to achieve incredible things naturally and effortlessly. However, the key point is that this adaptation has occurred on the ground, and under the constant force of gravity, and not in-flight!
