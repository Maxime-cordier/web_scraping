Many individuals will recognise the value of ‘talking through’ a traumatic episode, either with friends or colleagues. However, those who have been significantly affected by their experience may need professional assessment and/or treatment to ensure that they can return to operational duties as soon as possible. This is likely to involve more extensive debriefing (Critical Incident Stress Debriefing), giving an opportunity for the individual involved to discuss with a professional any emotions and memories of the critical incident with which he/she may be finding difficulty. The sooner this happens after the incident the less likely it is that the individual will develop PTSD.
