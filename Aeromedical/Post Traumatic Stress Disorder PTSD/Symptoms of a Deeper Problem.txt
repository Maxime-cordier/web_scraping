The immediate psychological reaction to a critical event comprises 3 symptom clusters: Re-experiencing of the traumatic experience: Nightmares, flashbacks and intrusive unwanted memories - this can be very unpleasant and distressing;. Hyper-arousal and emotional numbing: intense symptoms of anxiety - physical (shortness of breath and a racing heart) and emotional (feeling on edge, looking for signs of danger or feeling panicky). Many people feel emotionally numb and have trouble communicating with others;. Avoidance: The person avoids anything linked to the original trauma and which causes upset or irritation. Avoidance can become the main coping mechanism and lead to isolation and depression. Some will try to avoid the irritability by drinking and taking drugs - PTSD often presents with alcohol misuse and depression disorders.. In the majority, the symptoms settle down. However, in some people they can 'stick' and become chronic. If this is the case, PTSD may be said to be present.
