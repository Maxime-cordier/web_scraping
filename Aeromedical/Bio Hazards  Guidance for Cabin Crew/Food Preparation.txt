Aircraft operators should ensure that the handling of food is conducted in a way to avoid contamination by harmful biological agents. Most aircraft food is catered on board pre-packed and ready to serve or to cook. Aircraft operators should have a separate programme for auditing the standards at the catering premises providing the food to ensure the food is free from biological hazards. Where food is prepared on board, adequate food hygiene procedures should be in place to avoid potential cross contamination. Aircraft operators should provide adequate training to ensure that crew members are aware of biohazards and the mechanisms in place to control them. Training should be carried out prior to the commencement of duties as a crew member. Training should be reinforced periodically.
