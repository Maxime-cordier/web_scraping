Cleaning involves the application of energy to a surface, to remove dirt and grease. Energy is applied as: Physical, e.g. scrubbing;. Heat, e.g. hot water; and. Chemical, e.g. detergent.. Operators need to ensure that whichever of the three methods above they use that they understand the potential problems for commercial and civil aircraft: Abrasive scrubbing of aircraft components can lead to wear and premature change out of expensive aircraft parts;. Hot water can, over wet areas, lead to corrosion under aircraft floors as well as potentially creeping into electrical systems; and. Many detergents have to be very strong to be effective against certain hardy bacteria and spores and as a result they are not approved for aircraft use as they weaken interior plastics. This can lead to cleaning companies using weak and ineffective detergents.. The use of emerging technologies may assist in reducing these problems; there are new types of biocidal santiser coming onto the market that achieve a very high efficiency in destroying bacteria without using a very strong and aggressive detergent. Some have both Boeing and Airbus approvals and some even have a residual effect that continues to be effective for a number of weeks after application. Disinfection is the process of chemically reducing micro-organisms to a safe level that will not cause premature spoilage or infection. The aircraft manufacturer must approve any disinfectants used in the process.
