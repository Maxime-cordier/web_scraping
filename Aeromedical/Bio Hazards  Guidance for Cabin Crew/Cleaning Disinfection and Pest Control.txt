Soiling of surfaces and equipment is unavoidable on aircraft. It is therefore essential that such residues are not allowed to accumulate to levels that expose crew members to risk of contamination or other materials such as food that will become the onward agent of infection. Operators should ensure that effective cleaning and disinfection systems are in place. These are the key to controlling biological contamination onboard aircraft. Effective cleaning and disinfection will remove microbiological hazards, however, unsatisfactory cleaning may result in the redistribution of contamination that may increase the risk. Cleaners working on aircraft need to be carefully monitored. It is not unknown for cleaners to clean the toilet floor and then the galley floor with the same equipment or use the same surface cloths in both toilet and galley (Chemical hazards from inappropriate use or storage of chemicals, and physical hazards from inappropriate or defective cleaning equipment may also occur.). The reasons for cleaning:
