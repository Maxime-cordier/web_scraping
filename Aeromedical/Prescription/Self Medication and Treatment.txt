It must be recognised that because some illnesses may impact on a worker’s employment (money earning potential or even career) some workers will be tempted to self-medicate and self-treat without informing their aeromedical examiner or employer. It is possible for aviation workers to access medicines “over the counter”, without prescription, legally or illegally, and therefore retain some secrecy if they wish. Many medicines, herbal treatments and psychoactive drugs are available over the counter. The levels of supply and access to medicines and drugs are not uniform worldwide, and nor is their classification as legal, illegal or prescription only. The internet has opened up cross-border markets and also many aviation workers can travel to countries where controls and classification differ from their home country. In many cultures so-called alternative, traditional and herbal remedies are considered harmless, and these treatments are often used in parallel with prescribed medicine. Use of herbal medication, traditional and alternative treatments require particular attention to possible side-effects and their interactions with prescribed medicines and treatments. Self-treatment also extends to the “over-dosing” of prescription medicines, where a patient decides that a higher dose is required to gain the necessary affect. This may be common with sleeping pills and antipsychotic medicines. It also extends to the supplementing of prescribed medication with so-called recreational drugs, e.g. sleeping pills and alcohol, or analgesics and marijuana. It may also be considered as self-treatment when a patient ceases to complete a course of prescribed medicine or treatment without consulting his/her physician. The consequences may have an impact on safety, and the health of the patient.
