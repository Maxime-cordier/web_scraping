Many aviation workers such as pilots, air traffic controllers, maintenance technicians and cabin crew will be involved with safety critical operations. Such operations and activities require adequate vigilance, attention, focus, motivation, information processing capability, judgement, coordination, stamina and physical strength. Illnesses and conditions that might seem minor in many walks of life can have a profound impact on the safe operation of aircraft. Similarly many medicines prescribed, or over-the-counter, used to treat such illnesses may themselves introduce side-effects that also impact on flight safety. For example: for a pilot, operating at altitude, the common cold can cause loss of balance references and even severe trauma, as well as loss of concentration and tiredness. Similarly, using an antihistamine to treat an allergy can also induce tiredness, confusion, dizziness and blurred vision.
