A “Prescription” refers to the written permission of a medical practitioner that will authorise a patient to be issued with a medicine or treatment, e.g. a pain-killing drug or some physiotherapy. A “Referral” is not a prescription; a referral is made by a practitioner to a specialist, or specialist unit, when they themselves are unable to conduct certain required examinations, tests and sometimes treatment, due to lack of qualification, experience or resources.
