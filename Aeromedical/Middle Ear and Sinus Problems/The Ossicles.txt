The eardrum is attached at the umbo to the ossicular chain, which consists of three tiny bones: malleus (hammer) which adjoins the eardrum. incus (anvil) which links the two other bones. stapes (stirrup) which is attached to the oval window.. It is these tiny bones that create the mechanical amplification. This amplification is variable, depending on the frequencies; higher frequencies need less amplification for transmission to the cochlea.
