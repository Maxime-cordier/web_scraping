Sinuses are cavities within a bone or other tissue, and humans have many around their bodies. For flight, we are concerned mostly with the “paranasal sinuses”, which are a group of four paired air-filled spaces that surround the nasal cavity and they are named after the facial bones in which they are located: the maxillary sinuses, the largest of the paranasal sinuses, are under the eyes, in the maxillary (cheek) bones. the frontal sinuses, superior to the eyes, in the frontal bone, which forms the hard part of the forehead. the ethmoid sinuses, which are formed from several discrete air cells within the ethmoid bone between the nose and the eyes. the sphenoid sinuses, in the sphenoid bone at the centre of the skull base under the pituitary gland.. The paranasal sinuses are lined with respiratory epithelium; which is a moist tissue whose purpose is protection from potential damage caused by mucous movement, and also to act as a barrier to pathogens and particles. The paranasal sinuses are joined to the nasal cavity via small orifices called ostia; these are normally clear and allow pressure to equalise between the sinus cavities and the external environment. There are several competing hypotheses regarding the biological function and purpose of the paranasal sinuses, but it is possible that they serve no biological function at all.
