Accelerations of relatively short duration (a few seconds) are associated with situations such as flying in turbulence, rough landings and heavy braking. Provided a suitable restraining system is used there should be little risk of injury from short-term accelerations and rapid decelerations. Shoulder harnesses provide flight crew with greater security (than passenger lap belts), especially in a crash situation, and such harnesses also make it less likely that an incapacitated pilotâ€™s body might interfere with the operation of flight controls.
