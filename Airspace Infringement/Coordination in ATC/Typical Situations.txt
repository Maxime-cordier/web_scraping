Aircraft departing from an aerodrome that is too close to another ATS unit. Operations on closely situated aerodromes serviced by different ATS units. Activation of special use areas (e.g. danger areas or temporary segregated areas), i.e. making sure uninvolved aircraft leave that airspace before it is activated. Emergency or abnormal situations, including aerodrome unavailability, ground system malfunction, etc..
