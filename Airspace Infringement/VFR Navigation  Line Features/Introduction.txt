Poor VFR navigation technique can result in an airspace infringement. One of the most common ways to navigate under VFR is by selecting, during the pre-flight briefing, ground features which are marked on the VFR navigation maps and then looking for them on the ground during the flight. These VFR navigation maps depict topographic features and other information of interest to pilots flying visually, including major landmarks, terrain elevations, visual navigation routes, ground-based navigation aids, airports, rivers, cities, and airspace boundaries.
