Although line features usually make orientation and navigation easier, there are several issues that need to be considered: A line feature which looks good on a map may not be easy to locate from the air due to other terrain features. Therefore suitable line features need to be chosen during flight preparation.. Line features are generally unique but can still be mistaken depending on the circumstances (e.g. two straight power lines). The map should be examined to address this issue and make sure the right feature is identified when airborne. Check that the line feature has the same compass bearing as the one on your map - are you following the right one?. Line features are best followed when there is a gap between the track and the feature (e.g. flying on a parallel track that allows constant observation of the feature)..
