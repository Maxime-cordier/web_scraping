The objective of ASM is to achieve the most efficient use of the airspace based on actual needs and, where possible, to avoid permanent airspace segregation while optimizing the network performance. Competing interests for the use of airspace make the process highly complex. When it is necessary to segregate different types of traffic by airspace organization (e.g. aircraft conducting military exercises), the size and shape of the areas and the time regulation are made in such a way as to minimize the impact on operations. To this end, airspace reservations are normally planned in advance with changes made dynamically whenever possible. In Europe, ASM is based on the implementation of the flexible use of airspace (FUA) concept and is hierarchically organized into three levels: Strategic (ASM Level 1) - National and International Airspace Policy. Pre-tactical (ASM Level 2) - Day-to-Day Allocation of Airspace. Tactical (ASM Level 3) - Real Time Use of Airspace.
