The strategic level of ASM involves high-level planning activities. For these purposes, a High-Level Airspace Policy Body (HLAPB) is established tasked with: Formulation and review of the national ASM policy. Periodical assessment of the national airspace and route network. Establishment of flexible airspace structures (e.g. SUAs), including performing of relevant safety assessment and periodic reviews. Coordination of major events such as large scale military exercises that require additional segregated airspace. Establishment and review of the procedures for airspace allocation (level 2) and tactical management (level 3). The HLAPB is normally a joint civil-military body with high level of representation from the military (ministry of defence) and civil (ministry of transport) entities.
