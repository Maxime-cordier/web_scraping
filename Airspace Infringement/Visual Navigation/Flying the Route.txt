Fold the map so that it is easy to use in the cockpit, and so that it unfolds naturally to follow the route. Hold the map so that the direction of flight is at the top - not North; by doing this, 'left' on the map will correspond to 'left' on the ground and map reading will be much easier. Always be aware of the minimum safe altitude and the location of airspace reservations - above and below as well as on either side of track. Keep a good look-out for other aircraft, including microlights and gliders. Approaching a turning point, look along the new track for other aircraft, for weather, and for obstacles or rising ground.
