The easiest way to navigate visually is by selecting ground features which are marked on the map and looking for them on the ground. If the weather is fine, this is not difficult provided that unique, prominent ground features have been chosen. However, if there is cloud below or the visibility is poor it may be difficult to find the selected features. In bad weather, the best solution is to navigate from ground to map. Look for prominent features on the ground through holes in the cloud, then identify them on the map. The flight plan timings can be used to help in this, but care should be taken because, depending on the map scale, certain features that are easy to see from the air may not be marked on the map. For really important check points, (e.g. when approaching an airway) a line feature, such as a railway line or coastline, is usually better than an isolated point, because it is quick and easy to see. Also modern navigation systems based on GPS can be used as a supplementary mean of navigation. However, such systems must be certified so they are very expensive for the normal VFR flying.
