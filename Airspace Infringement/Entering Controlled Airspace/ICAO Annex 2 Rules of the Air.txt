The Rules of the Air state that clearance must be obtained before an aircraft enters controlled airspace (with the exception of a VFR aircraft entering class "E" airspace). All aircraft wishing to enter controlled airspace must file a flight plan, either on the ground before flight, or in the air, and the air traffic services involved must receive the request at least 10 minutes before the expected time of entry. (See ICAO Annex 2, Chapter 3, Section 3.3) Getting clearance may take a little time; the controller has other jobs to do and may be dealing with a more urgent task - perhaps on another frequency, and he/she has to check the position and level of other aircraft before giving clearance. That is why the request must be made at least 10 minutes before entry time. Pilots should be aware that: An aircraft must not enter controlled airspace until clearance has been received.. It is not sufficient that the pilot has informed the controller of his/her request; entry must await receipt of formal clearance;. The aircraft must stay clear of controlled airspace while awaiting clearance..
