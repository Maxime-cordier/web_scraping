A pilot wishing to enter controlled airspace should call the ACC responsible for the controlled airspace concerned using the frequency specified in the AIPs or Flight Information Publication. The initial call should be made at least 10 minutes before the point of entry, and should consist of the aircraft call sign followed by a brief statement of the request. “Zenda Control ABCDE, request crossing of A1 at Benton”. The controller will reply, saying either: “ABCDE, Zenda Control, Standby”, or “ABCDE, Zenda Control, pass your message”. If the reply was “Standby”, then clearance has not been given and the aircraft must wait, keeping out of controlled airspace. If the reply was “pass your message”, then the following information should be passed: “Zenda Control ABCDE is a Cessna 172, 25 miles West of Benton heading 100, FL 70 VMC, request crossing clearance of airway A1 at Benton FL 70 at 1023.” Clearance may not be granted straight away, because the controller has to check the position and levels of other traffic. Until clearance is received, the aircraft must stay clear of controlled airspace. When the controller passes the crossing clearance, the pilot must read it back so that he/she can check that it has been copied correctly. The clearance may not be exactly the same as was requested, but it must be complied with. For example, if the clearance was at a different flight level from that requested, the aircraft must climb or descend to the cleared level before entering controlled airspace. If the pilot is unable to comply with the clearance (e.g. if doing this will cause a VFR flight to enter IMC or due to the aircraft being unable to climb), they must advise the controller and receive an alternative clearance. The aircraft must remain outside controlled airspace until the process is complete.
