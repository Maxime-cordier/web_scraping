Some events are initiated by imprecise and unchallenged coordination. For example, if the receiving sector was informed that the aircraft being transferred was being stopped at FL280 “because of the 27” and there were two aircraft in the vicinity at FL270, the receiving controller could focus his actions in relation to the wrong one. A dedicated study has shown that a formalised and employed correct coordination phraseology and procedures could prevent one-fifth of generic loss of separation scenarios. It may prevent a couple more, depending upon the circumstances, but will have no positive impact on the majority of scenarios. Potential to prevent loses of separation is estimated to be around 25%.
