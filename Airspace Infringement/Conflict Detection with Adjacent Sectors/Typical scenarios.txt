Loss of separation with adjacent sectors usually means that standard procedures have not been followed or something has gone wrong with the coordination of a non-standard solution. The most common scenarios are: Correct coordination but incorrect action – the two controllers agreed on a solution but for some reason (e.g. clearance issued too late, inadequate or unexpected by ATC aircraft performance, etc.) the transferring controller did not ensure that the coordinated action was carried out.. Incomplete or misunderstood coordination – there was some misunderstanding between the controllers (e.g. ambiguity, incorrect use of phraseology, etc.) which lead to two different plans (the accepting controller believed one thing was about to happen while the transferring controller did something different).. Incorrect plan – the plan was correctly coordinated and carried out but had a flaw (e.g. involved a third party airspace or otherwise created an unsafe situation).. Lack of coordination – a coordination should have been made but the transferring controller either forgot or did not identify the need to do it.. Failure to correctly apply Standing Agreements or procedures – a standard procedure laid down in a manual or an agreement was not followed.. More detailed description of the scenarios is provided in the Conflicts with Adjacent Sectors – Typical Causes and Contributors article.
