A number of factors (that can otherwise be considered safe or irrelevant) can contribute to an event if combined in a certain way. The most common of these are: Transfer too early – this leads to a controller providing ATS in another controller's airspace for a relatively long period of time while not having the tools, competence or situational awareness required.. Transfer too late – sometimes the hotspots in a sector (especially in free route airspace environment) are too close to the boundary. Transferring an aircraft too late may limit the options of the receiving controller to solve a conflict.. Wrong frequency – depending on the circumstances, this may lead to various events from later check-in on the new frequency (due to the need to switch back to the previous one) to a prolonged loss of communication.. Sector skipping – sector clipping (an aircraft passing through a sector within a very short period of time, usually less than a minute) usually results in the controllers' desire to skip the “short” sector and avoid unnecessary frequency changes. Sometimes however, the definition of “short” becomes too stretched and a sector is skipped when it should not have been (e.g. a controller not spotting an aircraft there because of its dull colour representation).. Workload (too high or too low) – a high workload may lead to incomplete situational awareness or lower-priority actions (e.g. transfer of control) being neglected. A very low workload level may lead to distraction and negligence.. Obscured track label – a combination of different colours and high workload may easily lead to a track not being correctly seen by the controller.. Incorrect/insufficient plan – the lack of an adequate plan may result in erratic last-minute action which may interfere with the neighbouring sector's idea on how to solve the situation.. More detailed description of the contributing factors is provided in the Conflicts with Adjacent Sectors – Typical Causes and Contributors article.
