Since almost 30 year ago, EUROCONTROL provides support to the ATM community in planning and reporting their progress on implementing the European ATM Master Plan Level 3 (also known as the European Single Sky ImPlementation, ESSIP). Every year, EUROCONTROL takes stock of where each one of the ECAC States (and Comprehensive Agreement States) is in terms of implementing the ATM Master Plan (Level 3). The results of this reporting exercise are compiled in a set of Local Single Sky ImPlementation (LSSIP) documents. The LSSIP documents then feed into the annual European ATM Master Plan Level 3 Progress Report. This Implementation Report, together with the Implementation Plan, constitute the ‘implementation view’ or Level 3 of the European ATM Master Plan. The Level 3 of the ATM Master Plan addresses the deployment towards operational implementation, therefore focusing on the plans for 5 to 7 years ahead. The Master Plan Level 3 planning and reporting process: provides a comprehensive picture of the implementation of the Single European Sky package across the ECAC States;. helps align the performance of State plans with the evolution of ATM;. ensures that EUR Region States report to ICAO about their progress on the Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP) ASBU modules;. contributes to the alignment between States at the policy level of SESAR deployment.. Therefore, the EAPAIRR 2.0 is expected to be part of the reporting cycle detailed above as a new Implementation Objective starting on ATM Master Plan Level 3 Implementation Plan Edition 2022, and in alignment with the rest of the Single European Sky improvement actions to the overall European ATM system.
