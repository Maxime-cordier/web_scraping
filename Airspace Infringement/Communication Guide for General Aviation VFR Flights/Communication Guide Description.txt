To conform to ICAO language proficiency requirements, pilots and others who use radiotelephony communications must have achieved a specified level of proficiency in English. GA pilots come from different backgrounds, and some have difficulty learning or remembering how to use RTF efficiently. The Communication Guide provides pilots with common phraseology, in English, to be used during GA flights in Europe and explains why certain words and phrases are used. The aim is to improve safety by helping pilots and ground stations communicate clearly. The guidance material covers all phases of flight and has been developed with the objective to ensure maximum degree of conformance to ICAO standard phraseology. Thus it may also be regarded as a useful tool to use in regions other than Europe. Some States may specify national differences from the ICAO standard phraseology in the individual Stateâ€™s Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP). Pilots should consult the appropriate AIP(s) when planning cross-border flights. This interactive guide incorporates a range of material published by ICAO, EUROCONTROL and the UK Civil Aviation Authority. It has been produced in cooperation with the European General Aviation Safety Team. Open the Communication guide.
