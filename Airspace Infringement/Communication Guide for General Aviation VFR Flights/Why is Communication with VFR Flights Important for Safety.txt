The priorities for safe flying are ‘Aviate, Navigate, then Communicate’. Whilst this is always true, correct, standard radiotelephony (RTF) phraseology makes an important contribution to the safe and efficient operation of aircraft. Communication errors and inappropriate use of phraseology continue to feature as contributory factors in safety-related incidents throughout Europe involving General Aviation (GA) aircraft, such as AIRPROXES, runway incursions and airspace infringements Phraseology has been developed over time to provide maximum clarity and brevity in communications. However, while standard phraseology is available to cover most routine situations, not everything can be catered for or remembered. Therefore, pilots should be prepared to use simple language when necessary, keeping phrases as clear and concise as possible. Long radio calls with unnecessary information waste time and may endanger others.
