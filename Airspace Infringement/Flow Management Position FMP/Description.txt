A Flow Management Position (FMP) is responsible for ensuring the promulgation of procedures which affect operators or nearby ATC units. This is done by e.g. NOTAMs, AIP, ATM operational instruction, etc. The ANSP is responsible for establishing the local procedures, ensuring the Network Manager (NM) is in possession of all relevant data. The FMP area of responsibility is normally limited to the area of parent ACC. However, depending on the internal organisation within a State, some FMPs may cover the area of responsibility of several ACCs. The FMPâ€™s role is, in partnership with NM, to act in such a manner so as to provide the most effective ATFCM (air traffic flow and capacity management) service. To ensure that, they provide the following data to the NM: Additionally, the FMP provides the NM with "local knowledge", including any information which could be considered useful in the efficient execution of the ATFCM task. The NM advises the FMP of any information which may affect the service provided by its parent ACC(s).
