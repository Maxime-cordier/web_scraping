The EUROCONTROL Concept of the Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA) is that: Airspace is no longer designated as purely "civil" or "military" airspace, but considered as one continuum and allocated according to user requirements.. Any necessary airspace segregation is temporary, based on real-time usage within a specific time period.. Contiguous volumes of airspace are not constrained by national boundaries..
