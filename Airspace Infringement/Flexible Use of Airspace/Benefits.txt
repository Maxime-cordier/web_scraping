The Implementation of the FUA Concept has already benefited both civil and military aviation with: Increased flight economy offered through a reduction in distance, time and fuel;. The establishment of an enhanced Air Traffic Services (ATS) route network and associated sectorisation providing: an increase in Air Traffic Control (ATC) capacity; a reduction in delays to General Air Traffic;. an increase in Air Traffic Control (ATC) capacity;. a reduction in delays to General Air Traffic;. More efficient ways to separate Operational and General Air Traffic;. Enhanced real-time civil/military co-ordination;. A reduction in airspace segregation needs;. The definition, and use, of temporary airspace reservations that are more closely in line with military operational requirements and that better respond to specific military requirements.. However, progress in this area is inevitably slow and it is unreasonable to expect that the FUA concept will ever embrace all "military" airspace.
