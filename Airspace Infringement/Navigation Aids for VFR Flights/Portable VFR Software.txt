Integrates all the benefits from the GPS integrated system (accuracy etc.);. They are portable;. Very cheap compared to the integrated navigation systems;. The availability of such software is increasing and the pilot can choose the most appropriate;. Can be used for flight planning (most come with a PC-version too). Most incorporate the latest NOTAM, weather, can include traffic and can filter airspace view;. The information is always up-to-date;. Can give important warnings in case of airspace infringements, obstacle clearance, traffic avoidance etc.;. Can be used easily as direct-to and rerouting;. Relatively easy to use (intuitive) with little to no training required;. Some show the vertical profile for planned flights, helping to avoid certain areas if necessary;. Most can file a flight plan, if needed;. Can give access to other important information, such as approach plates, ATC frequencies, flight logs etc;. Can be used for flight debriefing as the flight track is recorded.. Not certified (a chart has to be taken at least for regulatory compliance);. The GPS receiver in the device may not be certified for aeronautical use which is not the case for specifically designed on-board equipment;. The tablet or smartphone used may not be adequate for sunlight reading and it can be difficult to see the information on a bright, sunny day;. The device can fail, leaving the unprepared pilot totally unaware of their position (which is why it is important to keep track of the flight progress on a paper map, to have a backup in case of failure);. It is the responsibility of the pilot to verify that the data are updated adequately;. The capability can be easily misused, e.g. hasty flight preparation; over-reliance on the tool, “direct-to” function used too easily, crossing restricted use airspace (but the device can help through its airspace warnings function)..
