While the paper charts are still required by the applicable regulations in force and the paper chart is strongly advised as a backup in any case (provided the pilot maintains awareness of own position on that map), the arrival of cheap and high-performance applications and tablets have made VFR, recreational flying easier and possibly safer. This is due to the availability of the always up-to-date information (a paper chart is often out of date by the time it hits the shelves), integration of NOTAM, airspace data, weather, traffic and own position, by the provision of alerts in case of exceeded thresholds such as airspace limits, minimum safe altitudes or obstacle data. It is the ultimate responsibility of the pilot in command to choose the most appropriate method, or combination of methods, to enable him to fly in accordance with the applicable regulations, conditions, skills and mission objectives, choosing between old and new technology and making sure safety is never compromised.
