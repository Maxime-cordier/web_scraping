The main risks arising as a consequence of misidentification are Loss of Separation and Airspace Infringement. These can happen because the controller may issue an instruction or approve a crew request based on what they perceive the situation to be while the aircraft taking action is somewhere else. It is even possible that the instrucion is complied with outside of the controllers area of responsibility. This makes it difficult to detect the situation and could prevent appropriate and timely rectification. An example scenario is shown on the picture below. The controller from unit A transfers DVK1990 to unit B. However, the instruction to change frequency is picked by DVK990. The controller from unit B does not notice the "slightly" incorrect callsign and (mis)identifies DVK1990. DVK990 does not seek confirmation. At this moment, there are two situations: If controller B instructs DVK1990 to climb to a higher level for some reason (e.g. due to converging traffic in 10 minutes) right after first contact, it is possible that the instruction will be complied with by DVK990 (who could consider the instruction as an extension of the initial dialogue). As a result, there will be a conflict between DVK990 and VBY995 in ATS Unit A, much to that unit's controller's surprise. In the meantime, the controller of ATS Unit B will also be surprised that an acknowledged clearance is not being followed. If DVK990 requests a higher level, it is very likely that Controller B would approve, seeing no conflict in their airspace (and still believeing the clearance will be complied with by DVK1990). This will result in similar outcome.
