where appropriate, the coded designator assigned to the standard departure or arrival route. Example:R11 M857 UB10 SOXER2K (4) Significant point (2 to 11 characters) Insert significant points on Your route using their designators (2 to 5 characters) assigned.Example:LN KTC TOSPO If no coded designator has been assigned use one of the following ways: (a) Degrees only (7 characters):Insert 2 figures describing latitude in degrees, followed by “N” (North) or “S” (South) then followed by 3 figures describing longitude in degrees, followed by “E” (East) or “W” (West). Make up the correct number of figures, where necessary, by insertion of zeros. Example:51N025E (b) Degrees and minutes (11 characters):Insert 4 figures describing latitude in degrees, and tens and units of minutes followed by “N” (North) or “S” (South), followed by 5 figures describing longitude in degrees and tens and units of minutes, followed by “E” (East) or “W” (West). Make up the correct number of figures, where necessary, by insertion of zeros. Example:5220N03305E (c) Bearing and distance from a navaid or navigation point: Insert the identification of the navaid (normally a VOR) or the name of navigation point, in the form of 2 or 3 characters (navaid) up to 11 characters when name of the point is used, next the bearing from the navaid/point in the form of 3 figures giving degrees magnetic, next the distance from the navaid/point in the form of 3 figures expressing nautical miles. Make up the correct number of figures, where necessary, by insertion of zeroes. Example 1: a point 170° magnetic at a distance of 20 NM from VOR “LDZ” should be expressed as LDZ170020. Example 2': a point 130° magnetic at a distance of 12 NM from CONTI point should be expressed as CONTI130012. (5) Change of speed and level (maximum 21 characters) Insert the point at which a change of speed (more than 5% TAS) or a change of level is planned, expressed exactly as in (1), followed by an oblique stroke and both the cruising speed and the cruising level without a space between them, even when only one of these quantities will be changed. Examples:LN/N0284A045 RUDKA/N0305F100 52N021W/K0260M080 4602N07805W/K0200F165 (6) Change of flight rules (maximum 3 characters) Insert the point at which the change of flight rules is planned followed by a space and one of the following: VFR if from IFR to VFR or IFR if from VFR to IFR. Examples:SUW VFR XIMBA/N0284A090 IFR DESTINATION AERODROME, TOTAL ESTIMATED ELAPSED TIME AND ALTERNATE AERODROME(S) (a) Destination aerodrome and total estimated elapsed time (10 characters maximum) Insert the ICAO 4-letter location indicator of the destination aerodrome followed by the total estimated elapsed time of your flight (NOT the planned time of landing). Insert “ZZZZ” followed, without a space, by the total estimated elapsed time, and specify the aerodrome name in Item 18 (below). If the name of the arrival point is not listed in any aeronautical publication, to indicate it in Item 18 use: - degrees and minutes of latitude and longitude. Example: ARR/5417N02005E
