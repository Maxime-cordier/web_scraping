maximum certificated takeoff mass of less than 136 000 kg (300 000 lbs), but more than 7 000 kg (15 500 lbs). /H – HEAVY, to indicate an aircraft type with a maximum certificated takeoff mass of 136000 kg (300 000 lbs) or more (except those specified as J). /J – SUPER, to indicate that the aircraft type has been specified as such (presently the only such aircraft is the AIRBUS A-380-800). EQUIPMENT The COM/NAV/SSR equipment on board and its serviceability must be inserted by adding the appropriate suffixes. The first suffixes will denote the COM/NAV equipment, followed by an oblique stroke, and another suffix to denote the SSR equipment. Options for COM/NAV equipment are: N if no COM/NAV/approach aid equipment for the route to be flown is carried, or the equipment is unserviceable, or S if standard COM/NAV/approach aid equipment for the route to be flown is available and serviceable. IMPORTANT: standard equipment is considered to be VHF RTF, VOR and ILS unless another combination is prescribed by aviation authority local regulations. NOTE: many pilots use “S” even though they do not have all the elements of 'standard' present and certified (for example no ILS). THIS IS A SERIOUS MISTAKE! If You are in such situation, list all your equipment with the letters given below. If none of the above options apply or the aircraft has more equipment than indicated by “S” insert one or more of the following letters to indicate the COM/NAV/approach aid equipment available and serviceable: COM/NAV equipment (only the codes most often encountered by General Aviation codes are given; for the complete list, refer to ICAO documents): A - GBAS landing system B - LPV (APV with SBAS) C - LORAN C D - DME E1 - FMC WPR ACARS E2 - D-FIS ACARS E3 - PDC ACARS F - ADF G - GNSS (IMPORTANT: When using the letter “G” on an IFR flight plan, the GPS receiver must be approved in accordance with the requirements from aviation authority). If used a NAV/ element in field 18 should be used to indicate the type of GNSS system.
