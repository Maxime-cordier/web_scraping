In general, to avoid the loss of visual terrain awareness, as a controller be proactive in the provision of assertive safety alert instructions, including the provision of the relevant minimum sector altitude to the affected aircraft. Provide prompt position information to an aircraft that has deviated from a cleared route, or whose observed position differs from the one being reported. Be aware that the flight crew can often be reluctant to declare a loss of orientation emergency.
