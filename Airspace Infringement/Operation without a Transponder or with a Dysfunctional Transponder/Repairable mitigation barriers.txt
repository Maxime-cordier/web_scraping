Mitigation barriers are designed to reduce the impact of the event after it has already happened. A mitigation barrier is called “repairable” when a failure has reduced the effectiveness of a barrier in the system, but certain actions may still be able to restore the effectiveness of this barrier. The main repairable mitigation barriers types are: The total loss of transponder information may sometimes be mitigated by the availability of primary radar data. However, if false primary tracks appear too often, a “real” track may be considered to be fake. This is especially true when no other data is available (e.g. information from the previous sector).
