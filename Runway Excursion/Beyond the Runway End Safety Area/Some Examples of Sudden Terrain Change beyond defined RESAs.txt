The following are examples of sudden down-sloping terrain change beyond the existing RESA provision at ICAO Annex 14 Code 3/4: Bristol UK Runway 27 At 60 metres from the end of the runway i.e. at the end of the Runway Strip, the terrain suddenly begins to drop steeply at a gradient of around 14%, continuing at a similar gradient for over 150 feet vertically. This is evident from the AIP Obstacle Chart Jersey Channel Islands Runway 27 At approximately 100 metres from the stop end of this runway, there is a sudden and continuous drop in terrain of about 200 feet. This is evident from the the AIP Obstacle Chart London Luton UK Runway 26 The terrain beyond the stop end of this runway initially slopes gently downwards at a gradient of about 3% for about 225 metres; the downward slope then increases to about 5% for a further 115 metres at which point an almost sheer drop of over 50 feet suddenly occurs. This is evident from the the AIP Obstacle Chart and in slightly more detail on the Precision Approach Terrain Chart for Runway 08
