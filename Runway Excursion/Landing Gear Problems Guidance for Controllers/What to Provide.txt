Apart from the above mentioned, a controller should: Transfer affected aircraft to another frequency, if applicable;. Maintain close coordination with ground emergency units - an early call could facilitate more effective deployment of resources;. Maintain awareness of the aircraft fuel endurance - provide reminders to the crew if required. Have direct contact with aircraft operator’s technical representative (if possible) - any result of a visual inspection should be passed to the crew without delay.. Be prepared to provide a wider range of information to the crew on request.. DO NOT certify the down and locked position of the landing gear - visual inspection during low pass should be done by qualified personnel. If not possible, the tower controller should provide information about landing gear not extended or only partly extended to the aircraft concerned without delay.. Use the proper phraseology as recommended by ICAO for such events, i.e. “The landing gear appears down” and “Landing gear appears up”. Useful phraseology utilised for such events is included in ICAO Doc 9432 Manual of Radiotelephony, Chapter 4, item 4.7.3, which states:. "If the low pass is made for the purpose of observing the undercarriage, one of the following replies could be used to describe its condition (these examples are not exhaustive): landing gear appears down;. right (or left, or nose) wheel appears up (or down);. wheels appear up;. right (or left, or nose) wheel does not appear up (or down).".
