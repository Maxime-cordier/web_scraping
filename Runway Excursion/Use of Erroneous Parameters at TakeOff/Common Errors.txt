The following list, extracted from the EASA SIB, provides examples of common errors that have been identified both in investigation reports and by other relevant safety studies: Whilst the vast majority of these errors are detected and corrected either at the time of occurrence, or later in the predeparture sequence, some are not. Individually, or in combination, any of these errors have the potential to cause, or contribute to, an accident or incident.
