The following list, extracted from the EASA SIB, provides examples of common errors that have been identified both in investigation reports and by other relevant safety studies: the Zero Fuel Mass is inadvertently used (in EFBs, flight dispatch computers, etc.) instead of the Actual Take Off Mass in calculating performance data. an incorrect value is selected from the load sheet or take-off data card and input into the FMS. the aircraft mass is incorrectly calculated, transcribed or transposed into an aircraft system or when referencing performance manuals. the Centre of Gravity(CG) value is incorrectly transcribed or calculated. take-off reference (V) speeds are incorrectly calculated, transcribed or transposed when manually entered into FMS or aircraft systems. aircraft data from a previous flight is used to calculate the take-off reference (V) speeds. take-off performance parameters are not updated as a result of a change in operational conditions; for example, a change in the active runway or condition (wet, contaminated, etc.), departure from a runway intersection, change in the wind conditions, ambient temperature, temporary runway length restrictions, etc.. wrong performance charts are used. the wrong table or column/row is inadvertently selected in the performance charts. an incorrect value is used when referencing the performance charts. an error is made when converting values into the required unit of measurement. wrong slats/flaps setting is used compared to the calculated take-off performance. Whilst the vast majority of these errors are detected and corrected either at the time of occurrence, or later in the predeparture sequence, some are not. Individually, or in combination, any of these errors have the potential to cause, or contribute to, an accident or incident.
