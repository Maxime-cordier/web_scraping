The use of erroneous take-off parameters is a safety issue of general concern and is not specific to any particular aircraft type. It can result in early rotation with the potential for tail strike, collision with obstacles in the departure path, loss of control immediately after becoming airborne, or runway overrun (as a result of either failure to get airborne or a decision to reject the take-off). In a number of cases, the loss of an aircraft during take-off has been directly attributed to the use of erroneous take-off parameters. Most frequently, the erroneous parameters are derived as a result of using an incorrect value for the aircraft take-off mass but can also be linked to circumstances such as transcription or data entry errors, reference to the wrong performance chart, wrong software version or wrong tail-sign used in electronic performance calculation programs, failure to update the parameters to reflect a runway change, an intersection departure or changing weather conditions, or selection of a take-off configuration that does not match that assumed in the performance calculations. Many National Aviation Authorities (NAA) and manufacturers have published Operational Notes or Safety Information Bulletins that are intended raise awareness, and reduce the occurrence, of erroneous take-off parameter events. These guidance materials go to great length to enhance awareness, identify causes, suggest mitigation strategies, recommend training emphasis, and advocate Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) strategies. Much of the information presented in this article has been drawn from those materials.
