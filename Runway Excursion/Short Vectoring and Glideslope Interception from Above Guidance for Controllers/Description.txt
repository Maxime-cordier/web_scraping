A stabilised approach is a fundamental factor in reducing the occurrence of both hard landings and runway excursions. Within their Operations Manual, most airlines define the criteria for a stabilised approach and mandate that the approach must be abandoned and a go around executed if the stabilised criteria have not been achieved by a specified height above the touchdown zone elevation (TDZE). This height can vary by airline or may have multiple values based on IMC/VMC criteria or might have multiple height "gates" in which the higher is a "should" gate which may only be passed if evidently correcting towards meeting stabilisation criteria by a lower "must" gate. The most common height values in use are 500 and 1000 feet but some operators have elected to mandate stabilised criteria at a greater height above TDZE. Responsibility for achieving stabilised parameters rests with the flight crew and it is solely their decision to execute a missed approach at the appropriate height should those parameters not be achieved. However, air traffic control clearances and instructions, be they vectors, altitude constraints or speed restrictions, especially in combination with adverse wind conditions or non-standard approach path intercepts, can make achievement of the stabilisation criteria difficult or even impossible and could well lead to a controller induced go around. To enhance awareness of these issues, the French Direction des Services de la Navigation AÃ©rienne (DSNA) has produced two videos which are targeted at their controllers.
