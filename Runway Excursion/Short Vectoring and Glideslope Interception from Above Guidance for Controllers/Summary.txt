A stabilised approach is a fundamental factor in reducing the occurrence of both hard landings and runway excursions. Responsibility for achieving stabilised parameters rests with the flight crew and it is solely their decision to execute a missed approach should those parameters not be achieved. Air traffic control clearances and instructions, especially in non standard or adverse conditions can make achievement of the stabilisation criteria difficult or even impossible. Controller induced go around can be prevented by issuing appropriate clearances and instructions that have been formulated with full consideration given to prevailing conditions. The DSNA videos are a valuable tool in helping to reduce controller induced, failure-to-stabilise, go around occurrences.
