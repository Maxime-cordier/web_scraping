The French DSNA has produced two videos to help make controllers aware of the increased cockpit workload and greater risk of an unstable approach that are associated with speed-restricted tailwind operations and with short vectoring that leads to an aircraft intercepting a glide slope from above. In this video, an arrival aircraft is provided vectors to shorten its route to the final approach. Note that the controller does not offer, and the flight crew does not request, track-miles-to-run information. Ultimately, the vectors result in the aircraft being above the glide slope at the point of localiser interception. Glide slope capture from above is successful but the crew is not able to achieve stabilised aircraft criteria and a go around is executed. Controllers, when viewing the video, should keep in mind throughout that: using the automation of a modern large jet to achieve glide slope capture from above requires that a specific, seldom used, sequence of events be actioned by the pilot flying. not all operators provide capture from above training to their crews and even those that are trained have little opportunity to practice the manoeuvre outside the simulator.
