This event can be rightfully classified as a controller induced go around. However, the pilots, in that they accepted the shortened route and did not anticipate the potential need for glide slope capture from above, are also partially at fault. Actions that might have been taken by the controller to help the pilots achieve a successful landing outcome include: providing track-miles-to-run information - provides situational awareness and, in part, the basis for clearance acceptance. modifying descent profile - assuming minimum vectoring or sector safety altitudes are not compromised, an earlier descent would have reduced the likelihood of (the need for) glide slope capture from above. providing early speed reduction - builds in time to allow for checklist and briefing completion and enables earlier selection of landing configuration. It is common practice, especially at busy airports, for ATC to impose speed restrictions on arrival traffic thus maintaining appropriate separation between aircraft whilst optimising runway capacity. Clearances such as "maintain 160 knots (IAS) until 4 miles" or "maintain 170 knots until the final approach fix" are common. However, it is imperative that the speed restrictions be reasonable and that they be tailored to allow adequate distance (time) for the aircraft to achieve stabilised criteria prior to reaching the 1000' (or 500') gate. The following video demonstrates the consequences of a typical speed assignment clearance that has not been modified to compensate for adverse wind conditions.
