Low visibility procedures (LVP) means procedures applied at an aerodrome for the purpose of ensuring safe operations during lower than standard category I, other than standard category II, category II and III approaches and low visibility take-offs. (IR-OPS Annex I) Low visibility take-off (LVTO) means a take-off with a Runway Visual Range (RVR) lower than 400 m but not less than 75 m. (IR-OPS Annex I) Note that ICAO requires LVP for all departures below 550m RVR, not just LVTO.
