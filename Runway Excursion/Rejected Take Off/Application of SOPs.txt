All the relevant Flight Crew SOPs must be clearly specified and applied, particularly: Cross checking take off performance calculations and the corresponding setting of ASI speed bugs.. Both flight crew must be fully satisfied that the prevailing runway surface conditions correspond to the assumptions which have been made in their take off performance calculations.. There must be unambiguous requirements governing crew calls of abnormal conditions during the takeoff roll and the degree to which the aircraft commander then has the discretion to reject or continue the takeoff.. There must be accurate calls of standard speeds during the takeoff by PM and a check that both principal ASIs are indicating the same figure at the designated check speed (usually 80 KIAS or 100 KIAS)..
