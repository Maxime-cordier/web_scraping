Whilst a successful rejection of takeoff from V1 is achievable in all but exceptional and very specific cases (see below), it is universally recognised that the closer the speed gets to V1, the greater the risk involved in a decision to stop. Therefore, once at high speed, it is usually specified that the takeoff will only be rejected for major malfunctions such as an engine failure or fire - or at the discretion of the pilot in command in the event that a similarly serious situation is perceived. In many modern aircraft types, the annunciation of non-critical alerts during the high speed part of the takeoff roll and in initial climb is inhibited to preclude unnecessary distraction.
