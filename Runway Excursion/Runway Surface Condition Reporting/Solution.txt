The ICAO Global Reporting Format (GRF) methodology envisages: Assessment by trained runway assessors and reporting - by means of a uniform Runway Condition Report (RCR) - of the runway surface conditions, including contaminants, for each third of the runway length. This includes contaminants categorisation according to their effect on aircraft braking performance and information coding in a Runway Condition Assessment Matrix (RCAM).. RCAM use by aircraft manufacturers to determine the appropriate performance data for specific runway surface conditions and provision of approved data and guidance material to aircraft operators for the safe operation of the aircraft on dry, wet and contaminated runway surfaces.. Provision of the RCR information to the end users (by AIS) in an improved SNOWTAM form.. Provision of the RCR information to the flight crews by ATS by means of voice communication, CPDLC and ATIS. The information shall be presented according to the direction of the aircraft movement, with the first runway third being the one nearest to the aircraft approaching to land.. Use of the reported runway condition data in conjunction with the performance data provided by the aircraft manufacturer to determine - along with other information such as, but not limited to, weather conditions and the weight of the aircraft - if landing or take-off operations can be conducted safely.. Flight crews shall report the braking action experienced when different from the expected one.. GRF originally was to be implemented by 5 November 2020, but subsequently was delayed until 4 November 2021 because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry.
