A baulked landing is, in essence, a last minute go around decision. That decision can be precipitated by a number of different circumstances. These circumstances might include any of the following: loss of visual references as might occur in shallow fog (MIFG), blowing snow (BS), or, during night operations, in the event of power failure induced loss of runway lights. Low Level Wind Shear (LLWS). a long landing as might occur after an excessive float or during Tailwind Operations. a bounced landing. strong and/or excessively gusty crosswinds. Runway Incursion by another aircraft or a vehicle. any other circumstance that leads the pilot to believe that a safe landing cannot be achieved..
