During the certification process for any aircraft, performance and handling are assessed across a wide range of weights, configurations, and flight profiles. The Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) defines the limitations within which the aircraft may be safely operated. It is a common belief amongst aviation professionals that aircraft are certified to successfully complete a go around from any point during the approach or landing phase. This is not actually the case. An aircraft is not certified to successfully complete a go around without ground contact once it has entered the low-energy landing regime, that is, during a baulked landing. The low-energy, or baulked landing regime is defined by Transport Canada as: Note that 50 feet is a representative value. A given aircraft may enter the low-energy (baulked) landing regime either above or below 50 feet based on the approved landing procedures for that specific aircraft type.
