A Baulked Landing, sometimes referred to as a Rejected Landing, is a low energy go-around initiated from a very low height above the runway or, potentially, even after touchdown has occurred. In virtually all cases, the go-around is initiated whilst the aircraft is in a decreasing energy state. A baulked landing, although rare, is considered a high-risk manoeuvre. Universal definitions of the terms baulked landing and rejected landing have not been adopted. However, some National Aviation Authorities (NAA) have defined the terms and have established training/checking requirements to encompass these events for operators under their jurisdiction.
