There are two primary, but critical, risks associated with a baulked landing: initial aircraft performance and climb capability due to the low energy state inherent to the baulked landing regime, and obstacle clearance, especially in IMC conditions. As previously indicated, touchdown may occur after a baulked landing has been initiated. This can further increase the risk, especially in the event that the pilot elects to abandon the go around and, instead, try to salvage the landing. By definition, a baulked landing is initiated well below and far beyond the Missed Approach Point (MAP) associated with any instrument approach procedure for the landing runway. As illustrated in the diagram below, this can potentially compromise obstacle clearance. At night or in IMC conditions (and under VMC conditions under some circumstances), this can pose an extreme risk of CFIT. Baulked Landing Obstacle Clearance For most aircraft, the standard actions for initiating a normal go around include simultaneously: These actions presuppose a normal approach energy state with engines above idle and speed at or, more frequently, above Vref. During a baulked landing, as per the criteria listed above, the engines are at idle and the airspeed can be below Vref and is decreasing. In most cases, the rotational speed of a jet engines must be increased, or "spooled up" before it will start to produce thrust. Spool up time is variable by engine type and, in many cases, can be significant. A lapse of several seconds from power lever movement to generation of thrust is normal and in some engines, the interval can be 6 seconds or even more. Flap retraction necessitates an associated change in angle of attack and will increase the stall speed. Under these conditions, the standard go around actions could result in a tail strike or an aerodynamic stall.
