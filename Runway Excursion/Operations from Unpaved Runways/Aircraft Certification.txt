In Canada, any modifications having a significant or appreciable effect on the aeroplane require an Aircraft Certification approval, in the form of a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) or an equivalent approval document. A supplement to the AFM, to provide the appropriate limitations, procedures and performance information (or data) for unpaved surface operations is normally required as part of a certification approval. The AFM supplement should also provide a surface definition to identify the characteristics of unpaved runway surfaces from which the aircraft has been certified to operate. Any alterations of tire pressure, or types of tires used should be considered to be major modifications to an aircraft. These changes should undergo an aircraft type certification approval process. Systems such as anti-skid and nose-wheel steering should be specifically evaluated for unpaved runway operations to determine and identify any handling differences. Many small aeroplanes and older large aeroplanes do not have aircraft certification approvals or flight manual information for unpaved runway operations. Some manufacturers have provided unapproved information, often called manufacturerâ€™s data as guidance for operations on specific unpaved surfaces. Transport Canada found that many air operators do establish specific operational procedures for unpaved runway operations to protect their aeroplanes from any adverse effects, but they may not account for the degraded aeroplane performance.
