Conditions of excessive moisture, such as those found during heavy precipitation, poor drainage or spring thaw can result in a significant degradation in runway surface strength. The degradation in surface strength may be enough to limit or completely restrict operational use. During periods of extended and deep frost, unpaved surfaces such as gravel runways can have strength characteristics similar to those of paved hard surfaces. Operational experience has indicated that two weeks of ambient temperatures of –20°C or lower may be necessary for an unpaved runway to achieve strength similar to a paved hard surfaced runway. Once frozen solid, the runway will remain in this state, until ambient temperatures increase to above freezing. It is important to know however that while the frozen unpaved runway may have the same surface strength as a paved hard surfaced runway, it is necessary to ensure that the runway also meets all requirements including smoothness criteria. The surface characteristics should also be considered to ensure the required aircraft braking performance is met. The following factors can adversely affect unpaved runways: Loss of material resulting in bare spots and sub-grade material appearing on the surface;. Accumulation of loose, non-cohesive aggregates on the surface because of material segregation;. Formation of ruts in wheel paths;. Persistence of damp or wet areas because of poor surface drainage;. Soft areas during spring thaw or wet conditions;. Differential heaving or depressions because of frost action;. Runway roughness or longitudinal unevenness (waviness); and. Vegetation growth..
