Protection of aircraft components is necessary so that operators can safetly use aircraft on unpaved surfaces. Operators typically achieve this through special procedures and equipment, e.g.: Gradual application of thrust or power to minimize the ingestion of materials by engines or damage to propellers;. Limited or prohibited use of reverse thrust;. Configuration of bleed air systems to minimize dust ingestion;. Reducing tire pressure without changing the aeroplane weight, which results in the redistribution of the wheel load over a wider area thus reducing runway surface deflection and tire rolling resistance. This may be limited, however, by the tire design and the necessity to avoid excessive deflection of the tire under load;. Reduction of aircraft weights if operating under reduced tire pressures;. Aircraft modification with oversize, floatation or balloon type low pressure tires for operations on soft unpaved surfaces; and. Installation of protective systems (e.g. shields, deflectors, and filters, engine intake vortex dissipators, abrasion-resistant finishes, etc.). These protect the aircraft from hazards caused by the impingement and ingestion of stones, dust and debris..
