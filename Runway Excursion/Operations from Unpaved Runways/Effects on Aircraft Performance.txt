Increased takeoff distance due to the increased rolling resistance (caused by the deflection of the surface under the load of the aircraft).. Increased stopping distance due to reduced braking performance.. Increased accelerated stop distances (in case of rejected take off) due to the factors mentioned above.. Degraded handling on the ground (during take-off and landing roll as well as ground manoeurving). The use of nosewheel steering may be necessary for improved handling, or in some cases prohibited if incompatible with unpaved surfaces.. Procedures and equipment necessary to protect an aircraft may also have an adverse effect on takeoff and landing performance. The procedures usually limit pilot intervention and most protection equipment (e.g. shields, deflectors, etc.) impacts aircraft aerodynamics and weight..
