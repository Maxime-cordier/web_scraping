In almost all cases, the activation of thrust reversers after touchdown will remove the option to reject the landing because the time necessary to regain effective thrust will use considerable runway distance. If such runway distance is available, it will almost always be more effectively utilised in continuing with the attempt to stop. If it is not available, then other options to avoid a hazardous runway excursion are likely to be preferable to an attempt to get airborne again. In any case, many aircraft types are operated under a blanket prohibition on a go around once thrust reversers have been deployed.
