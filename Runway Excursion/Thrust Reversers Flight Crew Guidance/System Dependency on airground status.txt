The option of thrust reverser deployment on an airworthy aircraft depends on whether the system has been signalled with ‘air’ status or ‘ground’ status, the latter being a pre-requisite. Aircraft certification requires multiple defences against reverser deployment when ‘in flight’ but during the short period of transition between ‘air’ status and ‘ground’ status and between ‘ground’ status and ‘air’ status, there can be both system use and system malfunction issues which are directly attributable to the status being signalled. One example of the latter is a link by design between slat retraction and reverser unlocking.
