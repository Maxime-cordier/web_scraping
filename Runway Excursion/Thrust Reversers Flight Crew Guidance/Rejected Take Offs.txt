Whilst the selection of reverse thrust will normally be part of the response to a decision to reject a take off at high speed, it should not be assumed that reverser deployment will necessarily occur if the reason for the reject decision is related to a possible or actual loss of airworthiness. In some situations, thrust reverser deployment might not be advisable anyway.
