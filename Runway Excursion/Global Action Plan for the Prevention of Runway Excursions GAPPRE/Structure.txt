GAPPRE is divided into two parts. Part 1 contains the agreed recommendations to aerodrome operators, ANSPs, aircraft operators, aircraft manufacturers, regulators and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and research and development recommendations for States, international organizations and the industry. Also included is a list of abbreviations and acronyms. Part 1 originally published on its own in January 2021. Part 2 contains guidance and explanatory material, as well as best practices, that support the recommendations. The development of the material in Part 2 was based on the following principles: The guidance and explanatory material is not intended to be limiting or prescriptive. It is based on best practices and materials shared by the industry in support of the GAPPRE implementation. The authors caution that the boundaries set by national regulators and internationally accepted provisions should be respected. An expanded version of GAPPRE, containing both Parts 1 and 2, was published in May 2021 and can be downloaded below or from Flight Safety Foundation's website.
