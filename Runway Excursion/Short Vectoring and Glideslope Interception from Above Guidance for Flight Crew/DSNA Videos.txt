In an effort to help make their controllers aware of both the increased cockpit workload, and the greater potential for an unstable approach, that can occur when aircraft are vectored or speed restricted, the DSNA has produced two videos. One video examines short vectoring that leads to an aircraft intercepting a glideslope from above and the other addresses speed-restricted operations under tailwind conditions. As these videos are controller focused, some written, pilot perspective, commentary has been provided to make the videos more meaningful to flight crew. In this video, an arrival aircraft is provided vectors to shorten its route to the final approach. Note that the controller does not offer, and the flight crew does not request, track-miles-to-run information. Ultimately, the vectors result in the aircraft being above the glideslope at the point of localiser interception. Glideslope capture from above is successful but the crew is not able to achieve stabilised aircraft criteria and a go around is executed. Some pilots, when viewing the video, might consider the commentary on the "risk" and "stress" caused by the event as overstated. However, keep in mind throughout that: Read more Short vectoring and interception of ILS from above
