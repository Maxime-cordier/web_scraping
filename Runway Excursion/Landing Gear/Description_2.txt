more complex landing gear. These consist of multiple wheels and sometimes the MLG is made of more than two assemblies. For example, the Airbus A340 Family is equipped with a MLG comprising three parts (one under each wing and the third under the fuselage) and the AIRBUS A-380-800 and the Boeing B747 Series have four (one under each wing and two under the fuselage). Some large cargo aircraft, e.g. the ANTONOV An-124 Ruslan and ANTONOV An-225 Mriya also have nose landing gears comprising two assemblies (in addition to the complex MLG design). Retractable landing gear is normally powered by the hydraulic system. In the case of failure, an emergency extension system is available. This may be a manually operated crank or pump, or a mechanical free-fall mechanism. Airflow is sometimes used to get the gear into the locked position. Landing with the gear in the "up" position or with an unlocked gear can lead to loss of directional control on the ground, a Runway Excursion, extensive structural damage or Fire, Smoke & Fumes.
