There is usually more than one sensor (anemometer) position but all measure the wind velocity at the standard height of 10 metres above the surface. This is the internationally accepted meteorological definition of ‘surface wind’ designed to eliminate distortion attributable to very local terrain effects. Any sensor will be sited so as to provide a representative indication of the instantaneous wind velocity in the immediate area around it. The exact sites of wind sensors should be indicated on relevant aerodrome chart in the State AIPs. At most airports used for significant commercial or military air traffic, there will be a least one sensor positioned to the side of any runway at each end in the vicinity of the Touchdown Zone (TDZ); there will probably also be at least one other sensor somewhere in the central area of the defined airside zone. Depending upon where this ‘general’ sensor is and on the relative complexity of the airport layout, there may be additional sensors adjacent to the mid point of each runway.
