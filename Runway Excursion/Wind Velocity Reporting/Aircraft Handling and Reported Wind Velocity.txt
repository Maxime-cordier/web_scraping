The wind velocity given to an aircraft is the best approximation of the actual wind velocity where the aircraft is at that time. The degree to which it is an approximation is always greater at higher general wind speeds but may also be dependent upon aerodrome-specific factors. Well recognised and significant local effects should be detailed in the AGA section of the State AIP. Intelligent use of available wind velocity information can be crucial to the avoidance of a Runway Excursion caused by loss of control near to or on the ground. Points to consider include the following:
