Like any other input to aircraft take off or landing performance calculations, wind velocity will be the (average) figure available prior to taxi out or top of descent. This means that whilst allowances are made in performance tables or equivalent computer programmes for a certain amount of variation in the inputs, any change in the wind velocity data used which may affect the validity of the calculation for the runway case concerned must lead to a re-calculation.
