The first part of the report provides a statistical picture of runway excursion accidents over a 10-year period - how frequently they occur, why they occur, and what factors contributed to those accidents. The second part of the report discusses the impact of a major runway excursion accident from an Australian perspective, and identifies the safeguards that exist at Australian airports to safely control a runway excursion if one occurs. According to Part 1 of the ATSB Report, approximately a quarter of all incidents and accidents in air transport, and 96 per cent of all runway accidents are attributed to runway excursions. Runway excursions involve aircraft running off the end of the runway (overrun) or departing the side of the runway (veer-off). The first part of the report identifies 141 runway excursion accidents involving the worldwide commercial jet aircraft fleet between 1998 and 2007. Those accidents resulted in 550 fatalities. Of those 141 accidents, 120 occurred during the landing phase of flight. An in-depth analysis of those 120 accidents is conducted in order to identify the types of flight crew technique and decision-related, flight crew performance-related, weather-related, and systems-related factors (accounted for 71 per cent of 343 factors) that contribute to runway excursions.
