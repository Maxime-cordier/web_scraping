The classification of factors contributing to runway excursion accidents established by Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) is used to categorise the most common types of factors contributing to the runway excursions identified in the ATSB report. According to the report, the most common contributors to these types of accidents and incidents are: Flight crew technique and decision-related factors flying an unstabilised approach. landing too fast, too far down the runway, or conducting an extended flare. delayed or incorrect braking action. ‘press-on-itis’. not conducting a missed approach or go-around despite unsafe landing conditions. Flight crew performance-related factors less than adequate flight crew awareness of procedures or systems. spatial disorientation, visual illusions, fatigue and task saturation. less than adequate operator procedures for assessing whether weather or runway conditions are safe for landing. less than adequate awareness of the effect of weather and runway conditions on actual landing roll-out length. Weather-related factors operating on a wet or contaminated runway. landing in heavy rain, wind shear, excessive tailwinds or crosswinds. inconsistent reporting of runway conditions and braking action at airports across the world. Systems-related factors aquaplaning on a wet runway. malfunction or unexpected action of braking systems.. In most runway excursions, any one or combination of these factors can lead to an unsafe outcome because of non-adherence to standard operating procedures, or less than adequate operator procedures for safe approaches and landings. In the majority of the accidents studied, less than adequate procedures or non-adherence to procedures led to: an unstabilised approach, resulting in a long, fast, or otherwise unsafe landing; or. a landing in poor weather conditions with unsuitable runway conditions for the aircraft type, resulting in a loss of control on the runway..
