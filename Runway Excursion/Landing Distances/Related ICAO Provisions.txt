The ICAO provisions are contained in Annex 14, Volume 1, Attachment A, Volume 1, 3. Calculation of declared distances: Some runways are also fitted with an EMAS adjacent to the runway end. However, as this is an additional safety feature intended to mitigate the effects of a possible lateral runway excursion (overrun) only, it may not be taken into consideration for when determining the landing distance available.
