EUROCONTROL’s European Action Plan for the Prevention of Runway Excursions of January 2013 states that “on-board real time performance monitoring and alerting systems that will assist the flight crew with the land/go-around decision and warn when more deceleration force is needed should be made widely available”. There are a number of commercial solutions available to address this need and Gulfstream and Honeywell have developed one solution, the runway overrun awareness and alerting system (ROAAS), which acts as a safety enhancement tool to flight crews during the approach and landing phases of flight operations in order to prevent runways excursions. Other commercial offerings by Boeing and Airbus are discussed in separate articles.
