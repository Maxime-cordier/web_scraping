ROAAS does not guarantee successful recovery from a pending runway overrun due to variability in factors such as pilot response, actual aircraft performance, and actual runway length and condition. Moreover, ROAAS may not be available at all runways worldwide, depending on database inclusion. ROAAS is not intended to be used as the sole landing or go-around decision making tool and does not substitute for landing distance assessments or normal flight management system (FMS) take-off and landing data (TOLD) calculations based on the aeroplane flight manual (AFM) and operator specific standard operating procedures (SOP) for stabilised approach criteria. The pilots should be able to manually inhibit aural warnings in order to avoid false and/or nuisance warnings due to a faulty or incomplete database, MEL-items, local NOTAMs, etc. The use of the ROAAS should be part of pilot initial and recurrent training. The ROAAS equipped aircraft operators should develop clear and unambiguous SOPs and callouts for ROAAS operations.
