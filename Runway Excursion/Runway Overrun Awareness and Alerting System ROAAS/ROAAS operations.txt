The pilot monitoring (PM) should use the ROAAS indications to provide succinct verbal approach updates to the pilot flying (PF) throughout the approach and landing (including roll-out). These crew callouts include an initial callout when the display becomes visible (“ROAAS is green”, or “ROAAS is amber, etc.). ROAAS can be utilised in a wide variety of scenarios and approaches, while accurately alerting the crew of potential opportunities for runway overruns and allows enough time for an appropriate preventative action to be taken. The ROAAS display and corresponding aural alerts act as a tertiary source for determining if the aircraft would stop within the runway length and, if so, a stopping point within those limitations.
