The GRF has its origins in the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Take-off and Landing Performance Assessment (TALPA) Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) and subsequent initiative. The TALPA ARC was formed in December 2005 following a fatal runway excursion at Chicago Midway Airport. Its purpose was to make recommendations on improving the safety of operations on wet or contaminated runways for both takeoff and landing. The ARCâ€™s primary recommendations were: To use a runway condition assessment matrix (RCAM); and. To ensure the use of common terminology by all parties involved in the process of determining and reporting the runway surface conditions and their effect on airplane performance.. ICAO began work on what became the GRF in 2008 with formation of a Friction Task Force comprised of 10 member states and seven international organisations, and supported by various panels and expert groups.
