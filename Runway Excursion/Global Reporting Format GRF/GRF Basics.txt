The basic GRF procedure is as follows: The GRF methodology is intended to cover conditions found in all climates and to provide a means for aerodrome operators to rapidly and correctly assess runway surface conditions, whether they are exposed to wet runway conditions, snow, slush, ice or frost. Because not all aerodromes typically experience severe winter weather (such as snow and slush), not all of the RWYCCs will be used by all aerodrome operators.
