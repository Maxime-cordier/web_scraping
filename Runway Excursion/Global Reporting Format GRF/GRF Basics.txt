The basic GRF procedure is as follows: An assessment of surface conditions is made by a trained observer who, using a globally harmonized runway condition assessment matrix (RCAM), allocates a runway condition code (RWYCC) to each third of a runway.. The code is complemented by a description of surface contaminant, including type, depth and amount of coverage, again using a harmonized set of descriptors.. The RWYCCs, which range from 0 for a very slippery surface to 6 for a dry surface, and the descriptors are then used to complete a Runway Condition Report (RCR).. The RCR is forwarded to air traffic services and aeronautical information services for transmission to the flight crew by SNOWTAM, ATIS and if necessary radio broadcast;. The flight crew correlates the RCR with aircraft performance data, which enables them to calculate their takeoff or landing performance.. Also included is a feedback mechanism for the flight crew to provide their own observation of runway surface conditions, confirming the RWYCC or alerting to changing conditions.. The GRF methodology is intended to cover conditions found in all climates and to provide a means for aerodrome operators to rapidly and correctly assess runway surface conditions, whether they are exposed to wet runway conditions, snow, slush, ice or frost. Because not all aerodromes typically experience severe winter weather (such as snow and slush), not all of the RWYCCs will be used by all aerodrome operators.
