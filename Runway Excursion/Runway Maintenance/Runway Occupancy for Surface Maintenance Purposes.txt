The necessary occupancy for runway maintenance activity is achieved by access when a runway is scheduled for closure anyway such as overnight, or for longer periods during which part or all of a runway is taken out of service. If a runway is going to be unavailable when an airport is open then a NOTAM must be used to advise accordingly. Whilst such NOTAMS are available in Airport Flight Briefing facilities and, increasingly, online, many larger aircraft operators take responsibility for making their flight crew aware of relevant NOTAMS through their own directly-provided procedure or an equivalent sub contract service provision.
