Whilst a missed approach can be begun on all aircraft types prior to all main gear making runway contact (and if runway contact by both main gear subsequently occurs during the transition from descent to climbing away), for some aircraft types deciding to reject a landing once all main gear assemblies have made runway contact may not be allowable under the AFM. It is therefore essential for flight crew to familiarise themselves with any limitations which may be applicable to their aircraft type in this respect.
