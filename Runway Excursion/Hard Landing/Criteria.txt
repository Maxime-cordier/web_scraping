Almost all of us, either as pilots or as passengers, have experienced what we may have considered a less-than-ideal landing. These might have been manifested in a firm or bounced touchdown, a sudden longitudinal swing to realign the aircraft with the runway centreline, overly harsh deceleration, or even the unexpected displacement of loose articles or the deployment of some of the passenger oxygen masks. Whilst uncomfortable for most, and potentially frightening for some, these events seldom cross the threshold required to be classified as a hard landing. In some situations, such as during a landing on a contaminated runway, the firm touchdown may have been intentional. As stated in the definition above, a hard landing is classified as the exceedance of a manufacturer limitation, which will vary by the category and purpose of the aircraft. For example, the hard landing threshold for an aircraft such as the MCDONNELL DOUGLAS F-4 Phantom, designed to land on an aircraft carrier, could be expected to be higher than that of a commercial airliner such as the MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MD-11. That said, based on certification criteria, the hard landing threshold is the same for virtually all commercial pattern aircraft and is expressed either as a touchdown 'g' loading of 2.6, or as a touchdown rate of descent exceeding 600 feet per minute (fpm), for landing weights up to the certified maximum for the aircraft type. For aircraft that are certified to conduct precautionary or emergency landings at weights above their normal landing limitation, the hard landing threshold is reduced to 1.7g or 360 fpm in the overweight condition. Whilst an exceedance of these values will trigger a mandatory hard landing inspection, many manufacturers also publish one or more cautionary thresholds at trigger values progressively less than the hard landing limit. Breaching a cautionary value will result in a supplementary inspection that is commensurate in scope with the severity of the event.
