There are a number of ways to help reduce the likelihood of a hard landing. Some of these are as follows: Ensure that a stabilised approach is flown. If the criteria for a stablised approach, as mandated in the company Operations Manual, have not been achieved by the prescribed height above runway, the approach should be abandoned and a go around initiated.. Use manufacturer recommended landing configuration, approach speed, and speed additives appropriate to the runway available, aircraft weight, and any residual airframe icing.. Use manufacturer recommended speed additives appropriate to the reported wind speed and gust increment.. Execute the flare at the manufacturer recommended wheel height. Avoid an excessively high (or low) flare height.. Avoid an extended hold off.. In the event of a bounced landing, follow manufacturer recommendations for recovery. Baulked landing protocols may be necessary to prevent a hard landing..
