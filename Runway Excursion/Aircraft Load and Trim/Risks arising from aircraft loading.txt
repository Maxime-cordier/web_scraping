The primary risks arise from the aircraft being ‘set up’ for take off with incorrect pitch, trim and/or take off reference speeds. This can arise in one of three ways: The aircraft is not loaded in the way stated on the accepted load and trim sheet (applicable to any load sheet type). The aircraft load and trim sheet uses correct input data but the output data is wrong (applicable to manual load sheets). The flight crew apply the (correct) load and trim data incorrectly when using it to calculate aircraft take-off performance data, including reference speeds and scheduled thrust settings.. The hold load is not properly secured or contains prohibited or incorrectly packed items..
