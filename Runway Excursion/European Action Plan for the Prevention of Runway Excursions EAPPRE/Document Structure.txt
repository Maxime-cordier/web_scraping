The EAPPRE is structured in two main parts: The guidance found in this Action Plan should not be seen to be limiting, and good practice should be shared as appropriate. The Guidance Materials will be continually updated and made available through the safety knowledge management process of SKYbrary. The boundaries set by national regulators and internationally accepted provisions should be respected.
