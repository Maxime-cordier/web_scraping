applied, propeller torque or P-factor, will yaw the airplane, either counteracting or aggravating the weathercocking tendency depending on the direction of crosswind and rotation of the propeller. In all cases, the pilot should be ready to quickly apply whatever rudder pressure/deflection is required to keep the airplane rolling straight down the runway and make adjustments as necessary. Multi-engine (DOUGLAS DC-3, Avro Lancaster etc):. A lockable tailwheel may be fitted to help reduce weather cocking tendency during takeoff and landing. Takeoff technique as above. In addition, differential engine power can be used during the initial takeoff roll to aid in directional control until the rudder is effective, though this is potentially hazardous for the inexperienced. Raise the tail off of the ground as soon as the elevator is effective. In all cases, manufacturer/Company guidance should be followed.
