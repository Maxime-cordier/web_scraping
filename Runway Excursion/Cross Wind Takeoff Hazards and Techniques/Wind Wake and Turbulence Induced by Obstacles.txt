Wind, wake and turbulence induced by obstacles may affect the handling and performance of aircraft during both takeoff and landing. Aircraft are, in general, much more vulnerable to disturbed wind velocity profiles during the final stage of the approach to a landing than during takeoff. However, significant variance in wind direction and velocity over the length of the takeoff run, caused by natural or man-made obstacles, can create a significant challenge to the maintenance of directional control during takeoff.
