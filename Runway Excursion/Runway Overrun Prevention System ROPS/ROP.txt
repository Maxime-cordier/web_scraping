ROP becomes active on-ground after transition from ROW and remains active until taxiing speed. ROP uses the aircraft’s current deceleration and aircraft characteristics to determine where the aircraft can safely stop on the runway. If ROP detects a risk of runway overrun, aural and visual alerts are triggered. On the PFD the red visual alert “MAX BRAKING, MAX REVERSE” is displayed. Aural alerts are prioritized: “BRAKE, MAX BRAKING, MAX BRAKING” aural alert is triggered until pilot application of pedal braking, then aural alert “SET MAX REVERSE” if maximum reverse thrust has not been selected. If overrun condition still exists at 70kt, the aural alert “KEEP MAX REVERSE” will trigger to remind the flight crew to keep maximum reverse thrust. ROP is reversible and alerts are cancelled when overrun risk is no longer present. On the Airbus A380 and A350, if an Autobrake mode is engaged, ROP will automatically apply maximum braking in case of runway overrun risk. ROPS and Navigation Display On the Airbus A380 and A350, ROPS is integrated with the aircraft flight management and navigation systems and provides pilots with a real-time, constantly updated picture on the navigation display of where the aircraft will stop on the runway in WET or DRY conditions (or pilot selected runway condition for A350).
