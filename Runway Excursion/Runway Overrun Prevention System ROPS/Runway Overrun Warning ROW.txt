ROW becomes active at 500ft and remains active throughout short-final, the flare and touchdown until transition to ROP. ROW stopping distances are based on the same principles as the Airbus In-Flight Landing Distances. On Airbus A380, A330 and AIRBUS A-320 family, ROW continuously calculates two stopping distances, the stopping distance on a DRY runway and the stopping distance on a WET runway. If the stopping distance on a WET runway becomes longer than the available runway length, the system triggers an amber message on the PFD “IF WET: RWY TOO SHORT”. If the stopping distance on a DRY runway becomes longer than the available runway length, the system triggers a red message on the PFD “RWY TOO SHORT” and a below 200ft an aural message “RUNWAY TOO SHORT”. On the Airbus A350, the flight crew has a runway state selector knob on the instrument panel. Consequently, ROW predicted stop distance is based on the runway state selected by the crew and thus ROW alerts are directly “RWY TOO SHORT” corresponding to the flight crew selection. At entry-into-service of the A350, the runway states DRY and WET are available for pilot selection. Extension to contaminated runway states is planned.
