The Findings and Conclusions from the June 2013 Go-Around Safety Forum held in Brussels contain many useful ideas for consideration including Strategies and Conclusions for various stakeholders. These conclusions are not necessarily recommendations, but are valuable for airlines to use as starting points to improve go-around decision making amongst their pilots. Some of these are summarised below. Strategy 1 – Enhance crew dynamic situational awareness.. Strategy 2 – Refine the go-around Policy (stable approach parameters and stable approach height).. Strategy 3 – Minimise the subjectivity of go-around decision making.. AO1 / AO2 – Develop SOPs to discuss instability threat factors during approach briefings prior to descent, and briefly throughout the approach.. AO3 – Develop ‘active’ communications procedures similar in concept to EGPWS or TCAS systems.. AO4 – Ensure unstabilised approach and go-around policies are clear, concise and unambiguous, including follow up procedures for non-compliance.. AO5 – Avoid directive or suggestive calls that may compromise on-going decision making, e.g., announcing, “Landing” at minimums.. AO6 – Re-define the stable approach criteria and stable approach height(s). In redefinition there is a valid argument to separate the profile (vertical and lateral) from the other stable approach criteria.. AO7 – Provide ongoing training to enhance awareness of psychosocial and management pressures that contribute to non-compliance during the approach phase.. AO8 – Cross monitoring effectiveness must recognise the importance of integrating low experience pilots into effective contribution to go around decision and execution.. AO9 – Pilots and their employers should understand that approach minima violation, is unacceptable because the evidence indicates that if a go-around then has to be made, the chances of a successful transition are reduced.. AO10 – The incidence of go-arounds should be continually tracked by Aircraft Operators based on a requirement for all PICs to file on the day of occurrence reports which explain the circumstances of the go-around. This will provide context to triggered OFDM events.. AO11 – Operations Manuals must contain a strongly worded policy statement which shows that, provided a full explanatory report is provided on any go-around made, no punitive action will follow. In addition, any ‘feedback’ will be provided in writing and be incapable of interpretation by a dispassionate expert observer as prejudicial to future operational safety.. AO12 – Pilots must be able to demonstrate that they are able to safely execute go-arounds commenced from high energy and low energy states at the point where the go-around decision is indicated.. AO13 – Pilots must be able to exercise tactical judgment as well as procedural compliance when deciding to go-around below the mandatory stabilised approach gate so that safe execution is not prejudiced by an inappropriate delay in the decision. Validation of this must be achieved by realistic training scenarios.. AO14 – Go-Around training should include a range of operational scenarios, including go-arounds from positions other than DA/MDA and the designated Stabilised Approach Gate. Scenarios should involve realistic simulation of surprise, typical landing weights and full power go-arounds.. AO15 – include lessons learned from operational events/incidents into go-around
