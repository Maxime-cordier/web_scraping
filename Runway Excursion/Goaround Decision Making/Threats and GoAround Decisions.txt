Central to effective go-around decision making is a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of situations, threats and circumstances that should, or may, require a go-around to be flown. Whilst a stabilised approach procedure may highlight the symptoms, it is the threats to flying a stabilised approach, threats preventing a safe landing and the threats to decision making capacity that need to be fully understood. Typical threats include: lack of preparation – “rushed” approach[9]. a late runway or approach procedure change. an inadequate approach briefing. challenging prevailing wind velocity. inappropriate energy management. inadequate traffic spacing. unfamiliar approach - maybe a straight in non-precision or circling. inappropriate aircraft configuration. runway surface condition. a predicted late touchdown point. unexpected runway occupancy after clearance to land. degraded aircraft systems status. the effect of fatigue. the effect of commercial and personal pressure (stress). Each of these threats presents a different decision-making scenario depending where the aircraft is on the approach (see decision making profile above). For example, some wind-shear, or a runway incursion, whilst the aircraft is still at 800ft may demand a different response than if they occur at 100ft. Knowledge and understanding of potential threats must include all stages of an approach, especially the part below DA/DH where, the pilot mind-set is that a landing will now be possible.
