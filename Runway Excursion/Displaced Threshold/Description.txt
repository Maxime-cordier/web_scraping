A displaced threshold is a threshold located at a point on the runway other than the designated beginning of the runway. Displacement of a threshold reduces the length of runway available for landings in this direction only. The portion of runway behind a displaced threshold is available for takeoffs in either direction and landings from the opposite direction. A threshold may be displaced either temporarily (due to e.g. construction works) or permanently.
