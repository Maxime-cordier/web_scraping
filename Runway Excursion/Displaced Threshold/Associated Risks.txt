A departing aircraft may not use the full available take-off distance which, especially when combined with reduced thrust take-off, may result in: becoming airborne closer to the runway end than expected a Runway Excursion, especially if a rejected take off is made. becoming airborne closer to the runway end than expected. a Runway Excursion, especially if a rejected take off is made. A departing crew may fail to properly align the aircraft with the runway centreline which often results in broken runway edge lights and FOD on the runway. Nighttime and the lack of runway centreline lights sometimes contribute to the confusion.. A landing aircraft may touch down before the Touchdown Zone (TDZ). This is often caused by either poor pre-flight preparation or by inadequate ground marking. In any case, the reason for displacing the threshold (whether temporarily or permanently) is that landing before the TDZ was considered unsafe.. A landing aircraft's crew may not be aware that the landing distance available is reduced in case of temporary displaced threshold or in case the reduction is applicable to both directions. This may result in a runway excursion..
