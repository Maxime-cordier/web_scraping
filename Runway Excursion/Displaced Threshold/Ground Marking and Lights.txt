A displaced threshold is marked by: Normally, runway edge lights are white in colour. However, in the case of a displaced threshold, the lights between the beginning of the runway and the displaced threshold are red in the approach direction. When the runway before a displaced threshold is unfit for the surface movement of aircraft, a closed runway marking (i.e. a large X sign painted on the ground) should be provided. When the surface before a threshold is paved and exceeds 60 m in length and is not suitable for normal use by aircraft, the entire length before the threshold should be marked with a chevron marking.
