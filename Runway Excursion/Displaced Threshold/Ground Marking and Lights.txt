A displaced threshold is marked by: A stripe showing the displaced threshold. Arrows along the centre line. Arrowheads across the width of the runway just prior the stripe in case of temporary displaced threshold. Normally, runway edge lights are white in colour. However, in the case of a displaced threshold, the lights between the beginning of the runway and the displaced threshold are red in the approach direction. When the runway before a displaced threshold is unfit for the surface movement of aircraft, a closed runway marking (i.e. a large X sign painted on the ground) should be provided. When the surface before a threshold is paved and exceeds 60 m in length and is not suitable for normal use by aircraft, the entire length before the threshold should be marked with a chevron marking.
