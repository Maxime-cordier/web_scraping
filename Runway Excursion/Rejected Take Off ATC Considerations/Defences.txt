There is no strict set of rules - controllers should use their best judgement based on their experience and prevailing circumstances.. Controllers should maintain high situational awareness and be prepared to use the most appropriate RTF when in doubt that an instruction to cancel the take-off would be effective.. In general, an instruction to abort a take-off should only be issued if circumstances exist such that continuing the take-off run will result in an accident (e.g. if there is an aircraft or a vehicle on the runway).. Controllers should communicate the most accurate information regarding the location and nature of a runway obstruction.. In the case of an observed aircraft malfunction, such as a burst tyre or fire/smoke, it is preferable to inform the crew of the problem and wait for their decision.. Unnecessary communication should be avoided. If in doubt about pilotsâ€™ decision it is better not to harass the crew with information requests. Ensuring the safety of the other traffic considering both cases (rejected and continued take-off) is preferable.. Adherence to local SOPs and checklists will allow controllers to react quickly and appropriately.. Deployment of safety nets to mitigate the risk of runway incursion (such as A-SMGCS) to protect runways and designated areas is recommended..
