An intersection take off has the potential to reduce taxy time and ground fuel burn and, in some situations, may provide some degree of tactical advantage. However, as noted above, there are a number of potential liabilities and pitfalls associated with an intersection take off. Preplanning and careful consideration of those factors should be undertaken before requesting or accepting take off clearance from an intersection. Specifically: ensure that the performance calculations are made using the appropriate runway length if full runway length is required and a backtrack is required to achieve that length, ensure ATC is aware of that requirement at locations where ATC uses multiple departure positions on a tactical basis, base the performance calculations on the position that provides the shortest TODA. If full length is required due performance limitations, convey that requirement to ATC. if full runway length is required and a backtrack is required to achieve that length, ensure ATC is aware of that requirement. at locations where ATC uses multiple departure positions on a tactical basis, base the performance calculations on the position that provides the shortest TODA. If full length is required due performance limitations, convey that requirement to ATC. do NOT use performance calculations based on full length for an intersection take off unless the data has been validated for the reduced TODA for both runway and climb performance. If performance numbers for the intersection have not been pre-calculated, do NOT guess; take the time to complete the calculations and/or update the FMS, or decline the intersection and utilise full runway length..
