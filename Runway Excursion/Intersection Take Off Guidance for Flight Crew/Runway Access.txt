The layout of most airports provides a point of runway access at, or near, the runway threshold from which take off is normally initiated. At many locations, however, multiple runway "threshold' access points, often on both sides of the runway, are used tactically by ATC to control aircraft departure sequence and make best use of runway capacity. These access points can be closely spaced or be many metres apart and, obviously, will not all provide the same length of runway for the take off run. At other aerodromes, the main taxiway intersects the runway at a point well before the actual runway end. In these cases, backtrack of the runway must be undertaken to achieve full runway length. Most major airports also have multiple taxiways that join the runway at various points along its length which are available for runway exit or, potentially, for runway entrance to facilitate an intersection take off. Not all runway access points or intersections are available for take off at all times. Potential restrictions may be imposed based on:
