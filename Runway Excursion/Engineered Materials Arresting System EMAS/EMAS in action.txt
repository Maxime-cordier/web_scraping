A number of overruns in the USA have had less serious consequences than might have been the case due to the presence of an EMAS. As of December 2020, there have been 15 incidents at U.S. airports where EMAS has stopped overrunning aircraft. There were a total of 406 passengers and crew on those incident flights. Runway 04R at JFK has seen three EMAS-mitigated overruns in which the aircraft have been undamaged and the occupants uninjured including: A very late and fast flapless day landing at New York JFK by a Saab 340B in 1999.. A deep landing at night at New York JFK by a Boeing MD-11F in 2003. Other successful EMAS-mitigated overruns in the US have included: A high speed Rejected Take Off (RTO) at Charleston WV by a Bombardier CRJ in 2010. A deep landing at Teterboro NJ by a Gulfstream IV in 2010..
