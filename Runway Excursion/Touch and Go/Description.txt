Touch-and-go essentially joins two manoeuvres into one - the aircraft lands on the runway, then accelerates and takes off again. The procedure is normally practiced during flight training but is sometimes used as a form of aborted landing after touchdown. An example of the path of an aircraft performing a touch and go. The advantages of touch-and-go include: The procedure offers some specific challenges that need to be considered when deciding whether it is appropriate to perform it, e.g.: The performance of touch-and-go instead of a landing must be communicated to air traffic control so that they may plan the traffic flow accordingly. Sometimes it would not be safe to approve a touch-and-go and the controller would clear the pilot for a full stop landing.
