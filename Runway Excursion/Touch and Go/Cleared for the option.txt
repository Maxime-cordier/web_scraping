Note: The procedure described in this section is used in the United States and the United Kingdom (and possibly, other countries). It is not a universally adopted ICAO procedure. The "Cleared for the Option" procedure will permit an instructor, flight examiner or pilot the option to make a choice between: This procedure can be very beneficial in a training situation in that neither the student pilot nor examinee would know what manoeuvre would be accomplished. The pilot should make a request for this procedure passing the final approach fix inbound on an instrument approach or entering downwind for a VFR traffic pattern. The advantages of this procedure as a training aid are that it enables an instructor or examiner to obtain the reaction of a trainee or examinee under changing conditions, the pilot would not have to discontinue an approach in the middle of the procedure due to student error or pilot proficiency requirements, and finally it allows more flexibility and economy in training programs. This procedure will only be used at those locations with an operational control tower and will be subject to ATC approval.
