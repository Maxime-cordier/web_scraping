There are some manoeuvres that can be viewed as an alternative to touch-and-go and are also used in flight training: An example of the path of an aircraft, performing a stop and go. The green part is the landing, the blue clock indicates the time when the aircraft is stopped preparing for take-off and the pink part is the take off. An example of the path of an aircraft, performing a low approach. The flight descends to the minimum descent altitude (or decision altitude) and maintains it until passing over the runway end. An example of the path of an aircraft, performing a go around. The flight descends to the minimum descent altitude (or decision altitude) and then starts to climb. Note that in a real-life situation the procedure may start before reaching the MDA/DA and sometimes after that. An example of the path of an aircraft, performing a taxi-back for take off.
