In response to the CFIT hazard, the industry developed and implemented the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) which provides warnings to pilots when the aircraft is in potentially hazardous proximity to terrain. The functionality of GPWS was limited so in order to overcome this, a new technology Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGWPS) (also known as Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS)), was introduced. It combines a worldwide digital database (regularly updated) of terrain, obstacles and runways with an accurate navigation system (ideally GNSS based).
