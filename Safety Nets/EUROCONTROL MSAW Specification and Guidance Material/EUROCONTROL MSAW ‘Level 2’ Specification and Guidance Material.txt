The EUROCONTROL MSAW Specification describes the minimum requirements for the development, configuration and use of MSAW in Europe. The Specification exists only as the final draft version while the Guidance Material has a ‘released’ status. Currently, there is no plan to undertake any further development of the Specification. EUROCONTROL Specification for Minimum Safe Altitude Warning Draft Comprehensive guidance material to assist in implementing the EUROCONTROL Specification for Minimum Safe Altitude Warning covers the full MSAW lifecycle: The MSAW Guidance is provide with several appendices to support ANSPs in the implementation of MSAW. EUROCONTROL Guidance Material for Minimum Safe Altitude Warning Released Appendix A: Reference MSAW System: Detailed technical explanation of typical implementation details of MSAW with emphasis on parameterisation and performance optimisation. Optimisation concepts are also covered in detail. Appendix B: Safety Assurance: A set of three documents that can be used as starting point for MSAW safety assurance work in a particular local context. Appendix C: Cost Framework: Appendix D: Case Study: A set of two documents describing the (partial) application of the optimisation and safety assurance guidance material in a demanding environment.
