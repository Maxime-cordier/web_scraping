The nominal response delay and nominal acceleration constitute the “standard pilot response” which is implicit in the collision avoidance algorithms: for an initial corrective RA, the pilot is assumed to initiate a response to the RA after a delay of 5 sec. and to accelerate the aircraft to the required vertical rate with an acceleration of 0.25g;. for a subsequent corrective RA, the pilot is assumed to initiate a response to the changed RA after a delay of 2.5 sec. and to accelerate the aircraft to the required vertical rate with either: an acceleration of 0.25g, for ‘normal’ RAs; or an acceleration of 0.35g, for ‘exigent’ RAs (‘reverse-rate’ RAs and ‘increase-rate’ RAs).. an acceleration of 0.25g, for ‘normal’ RAs; or. an acceleration of 0.35g, for ‘exigent’ RAs (‘reverse-rate’ RAs and ‘increase-rate’ RAs).. Note: The value of g (the acceleration due to gravity) is taken as 9.8 m/s2 as per the ICAO standard atmosphere model.
