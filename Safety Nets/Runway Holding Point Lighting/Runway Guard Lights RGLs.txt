RGLs are the first line of defence against an unintended incursion of an active runway by an aircraft or vehicle. They serve to raise situational awareness but do not provide or preclude authority to pass. The term was formally introduced by ICAO in 1995 when introducing a new Standard for what had previously been a Recommended Practice for installation of ‘taxi-holding position lights’. In their basic form, they consist of a pair of unidirectional yellow lights which flash continuously. They are positioned at each side of a taxiway at the marked and signed Holding Point where the taxiway is about to join a runway; both aircraft and vehicles are required to wait at this point until given clearance by ATC to proceed. They are sometimes colloquially referred to as ‘wig-wags’. The lights are required to have equal intervals lit and unlit and to flash at between 30 and 60 cycles per minute. They must be in operation whenever RVR is less than 1200 metres and must be switched independently of any stop bar lights (see below). They are often elevated, but this is not a requirement. The current version of ICAO Annex 14 also requires that where a taxiway, which is used in low visibility conditions, has a ‘wide throat’ as it nears a runway intersection and a stop bar is not installed but additional conspicuity is required, an alternative RGL may be used. This consists of a row of unidirectional yellow lights in line at 3 metre intervals across the taxiway at the Holding Point, inset into the pavement. Adjacent lights must be alternately illuminated and alternate lights should illuminate in unison.
