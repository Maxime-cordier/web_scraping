The most common airborne safety barriers are Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS), also called TCAS, (equipment based) and see-and-avoid practiced by the flight crew (human factor based). TCAS is one of the most robust barriers because it is installed on most aircraft and has proven to be highly reliable. Most transponder failures however can render the TCAS (almost) unusable: A complete transponder failure results in the inability to generate any TCAS alarms. There is no representation of the aircraft experiencing total loss on other aircrafts’ TCAS displays.. A mode S failure prevents the TCAS from issuing coordinated RAs. Duplicate mode S (although very unlikely to happen within the TCAS small volume of interest) would result in unpredictable and erratic behaviour, especially if the two aircraft are at different levels.. A mode C failure results in only TAs being available. Intermittent or corrupt mode C might lead to failure to notify the flight crew of a dangerous situation or false alarms being produced. Also, an intermittent reading could be considered by the TCAS as unreliable (and therefore ignored) while corrupt information may lead to unpredictable aircraft behaviour (since TCAS RAs have higher priority than ATC clearances).. See-and-avoid practiced by flight crew is one of the last barriers to prevent a collision. As a result of the high reliability of TCAS, flight crews sometimes rely on their equipment to identify a conflicting aircraft when given traffic information by a controller instead of trying to visually spot it. As a result, the pilots may “correlate” an observed aircraft with the TCAS representation of another aircraft and thus receive a false sense of safety. This, in turn, might lead to the crew not commencing a proper and/or timely avoiding action.
