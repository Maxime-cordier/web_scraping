TA/RA to activate the TCAS Display whilst crossing an active runway, then the SOP should contain a clearly specified procedure, and applicability, which covers the timing of selection and de-selection of TCAS for active runway crossings.. ATC need to bear in mind that issuing a clearance to enter or cross an active runway can be expected to be followed by TCAS selection to TA/RA. ATC may also expect that the corresponding selection to ‘Transponder Only’ will be promptly made after the aircraft has exited the active runway. This method of ensuring that, until next-generation TCAS is developed, existing TCAS equipment is not used in a way which may be prejudicial to safety, is compatible with procedures relating to Mode S transponder and TCAS operation on airport movement areas which are (July 2008) being proposed for inclusion in a revision to ICAO PANS-OPS Doc 8168.
