When a pilot reports a manoeuvre induced by an RA the controller should remember the following: In accordance with PANS-ATM (Procedures for Air Navigation Services - ICAO Doc. 4444, 15.7.3.3), once an aircraft departs from its ATC clearance or instruction in compliance with an RA, or a pilot reports an RA, the controller ceases to be responsible for providing separation between that aircraft and any other aircraft affected as a direct consequence of the manoeuvre induced by the RA. The controller shall resume responsibility for providing separation for all the affected aircraft when: Following an RA event, or other significant ACAS event, the pilot and the controller should file an air traffic incident report (AIRPROX). As controller, be ready to provide all necessary details to the pilotâ€™s inquiry on the frequency immediately following the particular RA event. Based on the provisions of ICAO Doc 4444 (15.7.3.1), the procedures to be applied for the provision of air traffic services to aircraft equipped with TCAS shall be identical to those applicable to non-TCAS equipped aircraft. In particular, the prevention of collisions, the establishment of appropriate separation and the information which might be provided in relation to a conflicting traffic and to possible avoiding action shall conform with the normal ATS procedures and shall exclude consideration of aircraft capabilities dependent on the TCAS equipment. Procedures in regard to ACAS-equipped aircraft and the phraseology to be used for the notification of manoeuvres in response to a resolution advisory are contained in the PANS-ATM (Doc 4444), Chapters 15 and 12 respectively. The following phraseology is contained in Doc 4444, Para 12.3.1.2 Circumstances following an effective ACAS RA, pilot and controller RTF interchange: PILOT: [callsign] TCAS RA; ATC: [callsign] ROGER; PILOT: [callsign] CLEAR OF CONFLICT, RETURNING TO.. (assigned clearance); ATC: [callsign] ROGER (or alternative instructions); PILOT: [callsign] CLEAR OF CONFLICT (assigned clearance) RESUMED; ATC: [callsign] ROGER (or alternative instructions); PILOT: [callsign] UNABLE, TCAS RA; ATC: [callsign] ROGER;
