A feature has been added to the TCAS II version 7.1 logic which monitors RA compliance in coordinated encounters (i.e. when both aircraft are TCAS II equipped). When it is detected that an aircraft is not responding correctly to an RA, a reversal RA will be issued to the aircraft which manoeuvres in accordance with the RA. In single equipage encounters (i.e. when only one aircraft is TCAS II equipped), version 7.1 will recognise the situation and will issue a reversal if the unequipped threat aircraft moves in the same vertical direction as the TCAS II equipped aircraft. Although the reversal logic change is transparent to flight crews, it will, nevertheless, bring significant safety improvements.
