In order to provide the MSAW function with proper data for monitoring, a terrain and obstacles model should be created in the air traffic control system. The following methods could be used: Use of an appropriate and accurate Digital Terrain Model (DTM) or a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) usually reduces the number of nuisance alerts since it provides much finer representation of the terrain than a series of hand-made polygons. It is important to understand the nature of any digital data that is used. A Digital Terrain Model (DTM) does not capture obstacles on the terrain, so it follows that a comprehensive set of obstacle definitions should additionally be made available to MSAW. Note that a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) may not capture all obstacles â€“ obstacles on the terrain may be mobile, be newly built or simply not captured by technology used to construct the DEM. States are required by ICAO Annex 15 (Chapter 10) to provide Electronic Terrain and Obstacle Data (eTOD) for the use in different air navigation applications, including MSAW. The eTOD should be provided as data sets having specific numerical requirements and covering the following Areas: Polygon Volumes are volumes of airspace which are set several hundred feet below the lowest applicable minimum safe altitude. As appropriate, that could be the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA), the Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA) or Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA), or it may be set to more closely follow the terrain. MSAW exclusion areas may be defined where no detection of hazardous situations will be done. Such areas can be established by ATC in order to preclude the MSAW function from unnecessarily scanning that portion of the airspace. If deemed appropriate, a mixed model, with the use of both polygons and digital terrain data for the description of terrain and obstacles, can be used.
