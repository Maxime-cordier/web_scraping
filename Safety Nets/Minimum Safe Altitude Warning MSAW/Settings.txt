The future position of the aircraft is extrapolated forward from the current track position for a predefined period of time know as the “look-ahead time”. The look-ahead time and MSAW function processing time define the “warning time” – that is, the period available for the ATCO to react to a hazardous situation. A long look-ahead time may lead to too many unnecessary alerts generated by MSAW. Too short a look-ahead time could lead to insufficient warning time for the controller to be able to respond effectively to an MSAW alert. The appropriate warning time will depend very much on the nature of the local terrain and the accuracy and resolution of the terrain model that is used by MSAW. Generally, a finer resolution terrain model allows the look-ahead time to be extended (compared to manually defined polygons), which both enhances warning time performance and reduces the nuisance alert rate. To optimise the MSAW function, different types of flights may be specified for monitoring. These could include civil, military, IFR flights, VFR flights, etc. The MSAW function may allow the user to explicitly inhibit alerts from specified secondary surveillance radar (SSR) code(s) or code blocks. These can be SSR codes for traffic which is not under ATC or which operates regularly in close proximity to the ground (e.g. airport helicopters, aircraft taking part in special events). Such settings may reduce the number of false alarms generated by the MSAW function. It may be necessary to inhibit alerts for predefined volumes of airspace (e.g. exercise areas) or for specific flights (e.g. Calibration Service Aircraft on a defined flight pattern) to suppress nuisance alerts.
