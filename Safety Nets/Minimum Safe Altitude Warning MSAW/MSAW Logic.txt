The MSAW function compares the levels reported by aircraft transponders that have pressure-altitude reporting capability against defined minimum safe altitudes. When the level/altitude of an aircraft is detected or predicted to be lower than the applicable minimum safe altitude, a visual and, in some implementations, audible warning is generated to the ATCO within whose area of responsibility the aircraft is operating. MSAW adds independent alerting logic to the control loop to help prevent controlled flight into terrain by generating alerts of existing or pending situations related to aircraft proximity to terrain or obstacles, which require attention/reaction. MSAW normally obtains input from the surveillance data processing, the environment data processing and possibly from the flight data processing systems in order to generate alerts. Some examples are presented below:
