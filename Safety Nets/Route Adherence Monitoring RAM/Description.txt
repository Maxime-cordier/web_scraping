Route Adherence Monitoring (RAM) is a controller advisory tool designed to assist in the early identification of a variation between the actual and the expected trajectory. RAM is beneficial to controllers as it provides advance warning in case of lateral deviation which could lead to loss of separation (the aircraft turns towards another one), airspace infringement (the aircraft turns towards an SUA or a volume of controlled airspace) or increased risk of CFIT (the aircraft turns towards high terrain). Thus, the reason for the deviation may be clarified and appropriate corrective action negotiated and implemented. Unlike cleared level deviation and Mode S selected level deviation, RAM is available for all correlated aircraft and does not depend on the onboard equipment (transponder). Naturally, its effectiveness depends on the planned trajectory and its prompt update with any clearances issued. On the situation display, the RAM is normally represented in the track label of the aircraft concerned. This is either done using a dedicated symbol or by a string above the label (e.g "RAM", "DEV", etc.) and a conspicuous colour (e.g. yellow, orange, or red) is used to draw the controller's attention. CopyrightSKYbrary The pictures above represent a variety of methods to indicate RAM. These are not taken from a real ATS system and are for representative purposes only. There are various reasons for the activation of a RAM alert. While some of them indicate a clearance non-compliance, this is not always the case. Therefore, in case of such warning, the controller must first identify the cause and then take appropriate action. A non-exhaustive list of such situations includes: The main consequence of RAM is that the trajectory recalculation for the flight is no longer valid. This results in the unavailability/unreliability of a number of ATS system features, such as:
