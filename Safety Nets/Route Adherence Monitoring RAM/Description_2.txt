The pilot deviates from the current flight plan in order to avoid adverse weather. The pilot mistakenly accepts a clearance intended for another aircraft due to callsign confusion. The main consequence of RAM is that the trajectory recalculation for the flight is no longer valid. This results in the unavailability/unreliability of a number of ATS system features, such as: MTCD. As this tool is trajectory-based, an invalid trajectory would result in false alarms and missed conflicts. This leads to increased controller workload and reduced capacity.. Estimate calculation and OLDI messages. A wrong trajectory makes it impossible for the system to accurately calculate and update the estimates for the exit points.. Colour-coding. ATS systems, especially in multi-sector (en-route) units, use different track label colours to focus controller attention on important flights and dim those that are of little or no interest. In case of deviation, however, it is likely that inappropriate colour will be used, which could lead to e.g. a flight unexpectedly entering the sector and being in conflict with another aircraft or an [[SUA]]..
