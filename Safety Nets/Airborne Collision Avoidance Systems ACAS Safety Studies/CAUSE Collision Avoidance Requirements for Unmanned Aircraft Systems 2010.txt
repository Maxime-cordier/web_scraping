Study of Collision Avoidance Requirements for Unmanned Aircraft Systems was started in April 2009. The evolution of aerospace technologies in the field of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), including autonomous operations, will impact European ATM as regards new military and civil applications. The CAUSE study will assess various aspects of potential UAS equipage with a collision avoidance system in addition to the sense and avoid functionality. Unmanned Aircraft Systems â€“ ATM Collision Avoidance Requirements.
