Two observations can be made with respect to automated airborne self-separation support: When faced with a conflict situation, explicit automated solutions do not allow pilots to explore solutions other than those presented. They may therefore preclude full exploitation of the available travel freedom and airspace capacity in future airspace environments.. In a complex traffic environment non-routine situations arise, often beyond the scope of the automation and unanticipated in the automation design. In such exceptional cases, a pilotâ€™s ability to improvise outperforms automated solutions..
