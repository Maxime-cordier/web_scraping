To support pilots in unforeseen situations, automation and instrumentation need to promote a high level of situational awareness. Improved ground and airborne surveillance might increase the level of situational awareness. ASAS includes 12 operational applications for ground and airborne surveillance: Ground Surveillance (GS) applications: ATC surveillance for en-route airspace (ADS-B-ACC);. ATC surveillance in terminal areas (ADS-B-TMA);. ATC surveillance in non-radar areas (ADS-B-NRA);. Airport surface surveillance (ADS-B-APT); and. Aircraft derived data for ground tools (ADS-B-ADD).. Airborne Surveillance (AS) applications: Enhanced traffic situational awareness on the airport surface (ATSA-SURF);. Enhanced traffic situational awareness during flight operations (ATSA-AIRB);. Enhanced visual acquisition for see & avoid (ATSA-S&A);. Enhanced successive visual approaches (ATSA-SVA);. Enhanced sequencing and merging operations (ASPA-S&M);. In-trail procedure in oceanic airspace (ASPA-ITP); and. Enhanced crossing and passing operations (ASPA-C&P)..
