In Europe, the future ATM Target Concept, as defined in the ATM Master Plan, represents a shift from an airspace-based environment to a trajectory-based environment and focuses on the following elements: A first assessment of the proposed Target Concept (commonly referred to as â€œSESAR Concept of Operations) has been performed, mainly based on "expert judgement" and has concluded that there is good potential for reaching the performance targets, although the capacity and cost-effectiveness targets in some areas (e.g. major hub airports, high density airspace) can only be achieved through supplementary actions (e.g. additional runways, functional airspace blocks). Additional activities have been identified and included in the SESAR work programme to refine the operational concept elements and acquire more confidence in the high level assessment results . The effort for the development of ASAS applications is shared on the both sides of the Atlantic. According to NextGen, which is the equivalent to SESAR initiative run by the United States, the ATM evolution is considered in three steps, notably: According to EUROCONTROL the timing is appropriate for ASAS development with the advent of SESAR in Europe and NextGen in the US. The availability of common global understanding of ASAS issues and the recognition of ASAS significance in the context of these two continental initiatives is crucial for the timely development of ASAS applications. ASAS development, validation and operational initiatives should include all stakeholders concerned. Standards should be developed and globally applied.
