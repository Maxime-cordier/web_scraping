Well designed SOPs should guide the pilots how to manage the aircraft in order to benefit from high vertical rates and how to avoid rates that are excessive (e.g. causing unwanted RAs). Most of unwanted RAs caused by high vertical rates can be avoided if the vertical rate is reduced to 1500 feet/min. or less at least 1000 feet before the cleared level.. Airspace design that avoids simultaneous horizontal and vertical convergence of aircraft..
