When VFR and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) traffic is separated by 500 ft, a "Monitor Vertical Speed" RA will be generated even though both aircraft are level at their correct altitude; this alerts the IFR aircraft to the proximity of the VFR traffic. However, deviation from level flight by the VFR aircraft is common, and will generate a "Climb" or "Descend" RA as appropriate if the separation becomes less than 350 ft.
