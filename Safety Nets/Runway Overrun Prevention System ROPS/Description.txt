ROPS is an Airbus system designed to continuously calculate whether the aircraft can safely stop in the runway length remaining ahead of the aircraft. If at any point the system detects there is a risk of a runway overrun, flight deck alerts are generated to help the crew in their decision making. ROPS is hosted in the aircraft avionics. The system has access to the parameters which affect an aircraftâ€™s stop distance, such as: ROPS is also connected to a runway database. The source of the runway database may be the Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) or the Onboard Airport Navigation System (OANS). ROPS automatically detects the current landing runway using the runway database.
