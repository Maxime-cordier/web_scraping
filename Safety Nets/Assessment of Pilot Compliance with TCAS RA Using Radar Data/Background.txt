The development and implementation of the Traffic alert and Collison Avoidance System (TCAS) was driven by aviation accidents. When there is a risk of collision, TCAS will issue a Resolution Advisory (RA) telling pilots how to change the vertical rate to avoid a collision, so a prompt and accurate pilot response to all RAs is particularly important. Late or incorrect responses may degrade safety. The Network Manager implemented a dedicated risk identification and monitoring process and identified the Top 5 Operational Safety Hazards. One of these hazards is TCAS RA not followed.
