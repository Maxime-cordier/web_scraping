A study was carried out a study has been carried out in 2020 (subsequently updated in 2021) to support the TCAS RA not followed operational risk in order to provide operational data assessing pilot responses to TCAS RA, as well as TCAS operational mode and serviceability. To conduct this study, Mode S radar recordings from core European airspace were collected for the period of one year and analysed to assess if pilots are responding to TCAS RA as required. The analysis covered 1176 RAs of over 8 second duration, i.e. a duration long enough to give the pilot a chance to respond. Nominally, pursuant to ICAO provision, a response to an initial RA is expected within 5 seconds. The pilot compliance criteria were based on the Guidance Material jointly developed by IATA and EUROCONTROL (Method A) as well as on a different methodology (Method B) which applied less stringent compliance criteria in case the pilot needs to significantly change vertical rate to comply with RA (e.g. from climb to descend). See Appendix A of the study for more details. Following the Guidance Material, each RA has been classified as:
