Mode S in its basic form has been standardised by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for many years. It employs ground-based interrogators and airborne transponders and operates in the same radio frequencies (1030/1090 MHz) as conventional SSR systems with which it is backwards compatible. Mode S has been deployed because the historical SSR systems have reached the limit of their operational capability. This takes the form of exceeded maximum number of targets, RF pollution, lost targets, identity errors and Mode A code shortage. Mode S is therefore an essential development for both SSR and the new ATM processes which will be essential in airspace subject to high levels of traffic density or absence of ATC radar coverage. There are five sources of RF pollution: Acquisition Squitter. Extended Squitter. Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) transactions. Self-generated Second Time Around Replies. Replies from other Radar Interrogations. Mode-S employs airborne transponders to provide altitude and identification data, with Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) adding global navigation data typically obtained from a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The position and identification data supplied by Mode S/ADS-B broadcasts are available to pilots and air traffic controllers. Mode S/ADS-B data updates rapidly, is very accurate and provides pilots and air traffic controllers with common air situational awareness for enhanced safety, capacity and efficiency. Further, it can provide a cost-effective solution for surveillance coverage in non-radar airspace. In Europe, SSR Mode S Elementary Surveillance (ELS) is rapidly being succeeded by Mode S Enhanced Surveillance (EHS).
