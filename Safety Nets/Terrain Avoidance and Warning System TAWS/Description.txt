A Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) is a safety net that automatically provides a distinctive warning to pilots when the their aeroplane is, based only on the radio altimeter reading and terrain closure rates derived therefrom, in potentially hazardous proximity to terrain. The first implementation of TAWS was Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) and was introduced in the 1970s as a means to combat the high incidence of CFIT accidents and near-accidents. Subsequent improvements added aeroplane configuration (e.g. landing gear status) and ILS glideslope deviation. This 'basic' GPWS was mandated in many countries and was responsible for a significant reduction in the number of CFIT accidents. However, it suffered from a significant limitation because it was dependent on the radio altimeter as the means to measure proximity to terrain which meant that there was insufficient time to avoid a sudden change in terrain in the form of steeply rising ground. From 1997, the Honeywell Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) which had been explicitly developed in order to overcome the above limitation, began to be fitted to aircraft. This system relates aircraft position, which should be from a GPS source which can be internal to the equipment or fed frim the aircraft FMS, to an almost worldwide terrain/obstacle/airport database which the equipment manufacturer regularly updates. A comprehensive set of reliable cautions and warnings can be generated which use both the radio altimeter and relative position. Subsequently, other OEMs produced similar systems and all have been generically identified by ICAO as Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS). The terms EGPWS and TAWS have effectively become interchangeable and to avoid confusion, the original GPWS, which is becoming increasingly scarce, will be referred to in this article as 'basic GPWS'.
