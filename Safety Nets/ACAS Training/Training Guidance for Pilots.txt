ICAO guidelines stipulate both practical manoeuvre training, using aircraft simulators (or suitable CBT), and theory training for pilots. ACAS should be included in recurrent training sessions and flight crews must be tested to ensure they are fully conversant with ACAS procedures, capabilities and limitations, and are able to respond correctly. The ICAO guidelines list 22 learning points relating to operational use and four items of best practice. Training objectives cover theory of operations, pre-flight operations, general in-flight operations, response to TAs, and response to RAs. Essential academic training includes: System operation: advisory thresholds; ACAS limitations; ACAS inhibits;. Operating procedures: use of controls; display interpretation; use of the TA-only mode; crew coordination; reporting requirements.. Manoeuvre training should include scenarios which verify pilot interpretation and responses to both TAs and RAs. The scenarios should include: Initial RAs that do and don’t require a change in vertical speed;. Maintain rate RAs;. Altitude crossing RAs;. Increase rate RAs;. RA reversals;. Weakening RAs;. RAs issued while the aircraft is at a maximum altitude; and. Multi-aircraft encounters.. The scenarios should also include demonstrations of the consequences of not responding to RAs, slow or late responses, and manoeuvring opposite to the direction called for by the displayed RA. The ICAO guidelines for pilot training on ACAS / TCAS are contained in Chapter 5 of Doc. 9863 (ACAS Manual) and in the attachments to Doc. 8168 (PANS-OPS). Additional training guidance is included in JAA’s. The guidance material is accessible via 'Further Reading' below. Note that while the principal and essential technical and operational features of ACAS are introduced in the following, it is not, on its own, considered complete training: EUROCONTROL: TCAS version 7.1 for pilots.
