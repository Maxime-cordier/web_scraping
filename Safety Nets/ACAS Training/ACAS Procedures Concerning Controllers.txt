Although ACAS is an avionics system, it can have significant impact on ATM operations. Therefore, air traffic controllers should have a good understanding of ACAS operations and procedures. ACAS events are relatively rare, hence the controller exposure to this events is low, which reinforces the need for recurrent training. The ICAO guidelines for controller training on ACAS / TCAS are contained in Chapter 6 of Doc. 9863 (ACAS Manual). ACAS procedures to be followed by ATC are provided in Doc 4444 (PANS ATM). The relevant sections of these documents can be acceesed via 'Further Reading' below. Additionally, the EUROCONTROL Specification for the ATCO Common Core Content Initial Training details the minimum training requirement in the basic syllabus as well as for each rating. For additional information consult the EUROCONTROL presentation (link provided below) that has been designed to support the training of controllers. Note that it is not designed or intended to meet the complete training requirements, but it does introduces the principal and essential technical and operational features of ACAS.
