Hazardous situations related to aircraft separation can remain unnoticed by the flight crew and the controller. The controllerâ€™s workload and priorities may cause an imminent hazardous situation to remain undetected if not alerted by STCA. This is especially likely to occur during heavy workload conditions. For the successful implementation of STCA, it is necessary to tune the function taking into account the specifications and local environment and to provide the relevant training to controllers and engineers.
