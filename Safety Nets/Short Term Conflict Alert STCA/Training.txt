Best practices for using STCA have shown that the increasing complexity of STCA and the environment in which it is used are addressed through appropriate training and competency assessment. The primary goal of the training is to develop and maintain an adequate level of trust in STCA, i.e. to make controllers aware of situations where STCA is likely to be effective and, more importantly, situations in which STCA will not be so effective (e.g. sudden, unexpected manoeuvres).
