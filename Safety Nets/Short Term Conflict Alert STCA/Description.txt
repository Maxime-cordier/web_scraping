A Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) is a system to warn the ATCO of any situation where user defined minimum separation distances between any pair of surveillance tracks is, or is predicted to be violated within a short look ahead time (usually 2 minutes). This is achieved via a visual alert on the radar display, though some systems also provide an audible alert. STCA is a concept rather than a specific system; there are therefore a number of differing implementations used by ATC providers across the world. EUROCONTROL recommends that the following principles be placed at the centre of policy making for use of STCA: STCA is a safety net; its sole purpose is to enhance safety and its presence is ignored when calculating sector capacity.. STCA is designed, configured and used to make a significant positive contribution to the effectiveness of separation provision and collision avoidance.. Specific training should be provided to ATC staff for the correct use of STCA.
