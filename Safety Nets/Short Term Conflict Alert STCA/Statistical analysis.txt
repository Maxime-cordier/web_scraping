Retaining electronic records of all STCA alerts generated by the appropriate ATS authority may facilitate the statistical analyses. The data and circumstances pertaining to each alert should be analysed to determine whether an alert was justified or not. A statistical analysis should be made of alerts in order to identify possible shortcomings in airspace design and ATC procedures as well as to monitor overall safety levels.
