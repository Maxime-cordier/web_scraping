Generally, two types of safety barriers exist – prevention barriers and mitigation barriers. The former are used to minimize the risk of an occurrence happening and the latter are intended to eliminate or reduce the impact of an event after it has happened.

Therefore, this article focuses on the mitigation barriers, which are divided into “repairable” and “other” categories based on the barrier’s ability to be restored (after being breached), e.g. by a procedure. Furthermore, the mitigation barriers (as well as all safety barriers in general) are divided into several stages each of which is intended to activate if the previous have failed:
