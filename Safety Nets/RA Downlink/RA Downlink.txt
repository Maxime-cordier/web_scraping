RA information is transmitted to the ground via different channels. This is referred to as RA downlink. RA downlink is used for offline monitoring of ACAS. More recently RA downlink is also used to display RA information on controller working positions by some ANSPs. Pilots often fail to report an RA to ATC or delay their reports. Studies conducted in 2009 indicate that 50% of all RAs are reported within 16 sec. of RA onset. Pilots report only 48% of Climb or Descend RA, while ICAO requires that RAs requiring a deviation from the current ATC clearance or instruction are reported. Pilot reports are sometimes lengthy, unstructured, incorrect or incomplete, requiring repetition or clarification from the controller. If controllers do not know that the aircraft is responding to an RA, they might issue an instruction in an attempt to resolve the conflict. That instruction could contradict the RA. Potential benefits of RA downlink include:
