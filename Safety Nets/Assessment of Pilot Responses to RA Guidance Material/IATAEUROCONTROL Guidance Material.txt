IATA and EUROCONTROL have jointly produced guidance on the assessment of pilot compliance to Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) RAs using Flight Data Monitoring (FDM). This document highlights that the most important single factor affecting the performance of TCAS is the response of pilots to RAs. The Guidance Material, which is based on the ICAO provisions, recommends that operators establish procedures detailing how their flight crews should operate TCAS and respond to RAs. The document provides general guidance on the assessment of pilot responses to TCAS RAs and contains a set of indicators and measurements to support such assessment. Third edition of the Guidance Material introduces two methods of the assessment of pilot responses to TCAS RAs and provides a tool to score the responses using both methods.
