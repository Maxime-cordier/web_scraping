Current Airborne Safety Nets include: Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS), which operates independently of ground-based equipment to provide advice to the pilot on potential conflicting aircraft that are equipped with SSR transponders.. Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), which provides timely and distinctive warning to the flight crew of sink rate, ground proximity, altitude loss after take-off or go-around, incorrect landing configuration and downward glide slope deviation, and includes a predictive terrain hazard warning function. More advanced systems, introduced in 1996 are known as Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems (EGPWS), although the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) uses the broader term Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS).. Other safety nets available, which are not as yet mandated or universally fitted, include: High Energy Approach Monitoring Systems which warn the pilots if the energy predicted at touch down exceeds a pre-determined safe level; Runway Overrun Protection Systems (ROPS) which provide the pilots with a real-time constantly updated picture in the navigation display of where the aircraft will stop on the runway in wet or dry conditions; and Systems which warn pilots of unusual attitudes, e.g. excessive bank or pitch angle. These may be combined with GPWS/TAWS systems.. High Energy Approach Monitoring Systems which warn the pilots if the energy predicted at touch down exceeds a pre-determined safe level;.
