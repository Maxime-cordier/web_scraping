All turbine engines must be certificated for operation in icing conditions on the basis that inadvertent icing encounters are always possible, even for aircraft not certificated for flight in such conditions. Turbine engine certification has historically been focussed on inlet ice protection which is addressed in CS E-780 in CFR14- Part 33.68. Just as the ‘discovery’ of the SLD hazard for airframes led to a recognition of the limitations of the definition of icing conditions in Appendix C, a similar ‘discovery’ of the hazardous effects of ice crystal icing on turbine engines has led to the investigation of this phenomenon in order to inform an effective extension of current certification requirements. Appendix C conditions were supplemented at CS25 Amendment 16 in 2015 also by Appendix P for ice crystal and mixed phase icing conditions. So far, the corresponding changes have not been introduced in 14 CFR Part-25. CS25 Appendix P provides a depiction of the ice crystal icing envelope. Within the envelope, total water content (TWC) in g/m3 has been determined based upon the adiabatic lapse defined by the convective rise of 90 % relative humidity air from sea level to higher altitudes and scaled by a factor of 0.65 to a standard cloud length of 32.2 km (17.4 nautical miles). Appendix P also displays TWC for this distance over a range of ambient temperature within the boundaries of the ice crystal envelope.
