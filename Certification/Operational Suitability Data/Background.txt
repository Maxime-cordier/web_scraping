The concept of operational suitability data (OSD) draws its origins from the operational evaluation board (OEB) existing under the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA). Operational evaluations have been conducted by the JAA and then by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) since 1997. Under the OEB scheme aircraft manufacturers submitted, on a voluntary basis, recommendations for the approval of aircraft type rating training courses (flight and cabin crew) and the minimum equipment lists (MELs). OEB reports have been published on the EASA website in support of approved training organisations (ATOs) and air operators for the aircraft, equipment and/or operations evaluated under the OEB reports.
