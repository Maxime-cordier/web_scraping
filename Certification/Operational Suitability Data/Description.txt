The European Commission has published a new requirement in aircraft certification with regard to operational suitability data, thereby mandating that aircraft manufacturers submit data EASA considers important for safe operations. Under Commission Regulation (EU) No 69/2014 of 27 January 2014 amending Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 laying down implementing rules for the airworthiness and environmental certification of aircraft and related products, parts and appliances (Part-21), the data is to be approved by EASA under the aircraft type certificate and then used by air operators and flight and maintenance training organisations. The mandatory OSD succeeds the voluntary OEB process. There exist five categories of OSD and these cover: pilot training, cabin crew training, the master minimum equipment list (MMEL), maintenance staff training and simulator qualification. It is under Commission Regulation (EU) No 70/2014 of 27 January 2014 amending Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 (itself laying down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to civil aviation aircrew (EASA AIR CREW) that the use of OSD is mandated and regulated for approved training organisations. Commission Regulation (EU) No 71/2014 of 27 January 2014 amending Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 (EASA AIR OPS which lays down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to air operations) mandates and regulates the use of OSD by air operators in the EU. Requirements regarding the use of OSD by Part-147 approved maintenance training organisations have yet to be published.
