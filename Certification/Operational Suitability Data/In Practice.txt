The process begins when the aircraft manufacturer proposes what data EASA will evaluate against the rule for approval. OSD are approved as part of the type certificate like the airplane flight manual, and are referenced in the applicable type certificate data sheet (TCDS). Since the holder of the type certificate is the owner of OSD, the manufacturer is required to keep the data current. The OSD then becomes the reference document for customised training and for MELs as developed by the users of the OSD (air operators and training organisations). OSD has both mandatory and recommended elements and it is up to the national aviation authorities (NAAs) to determine whether users must comply with a recommendation. Pilot qualification is at the heart of OSD. It defines a minimum syllabus for a type rating, as well as training areas of special emphasis. EASA has provided a transition period for the industry to comply with new OSD requirement. MMELs for in-production models, for example, must be approved by 18/12/2015, or before the aircraft is operated by an EU operator, whichever is the latest.
