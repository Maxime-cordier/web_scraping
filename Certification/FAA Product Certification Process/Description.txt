The FAA and Industry Guide to Product Certification (CPI Guide, 3rd edition), published in May 2017, notes significant changes in the certification processes over the previous 10-15 years that were effected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification and design approval processes to enhance product safety. The CPI Guide says a credible and concise product certification process better ensures safe aircraft and consists of: Timely, efficient and predictable product type design and production approvals,. Clearly defined and understood roles, responsibilities, and accountability of all stakeholders,. Timely identification of the certification basis, means of compliance, potential safety issues, and business practice requirements,. Effective issue resolution process that includes a pre-defined structured escalation to appropriate leadership within FAA and Applicant stakeholders. Emphasis should be placed on Applicants to have robust, internal issue resolution processes that maximizes internal Applicant vetting and minimizes need for FAA involvement,. Optimal delegation using a risk based approach with appropriate controls and systemic oversight, and. Maximum use of the Applicantâ€™s showing of compliance based on observed competencies.. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations defines a "product" as an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance.
