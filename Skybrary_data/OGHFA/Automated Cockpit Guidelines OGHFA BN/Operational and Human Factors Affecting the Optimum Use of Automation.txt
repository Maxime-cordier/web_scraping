The following operational and human factors are often observed in incidents and accidents where the use of automation is identified as a causal factor: Intimidation — noninterference with or late takeover from automation when needed. Overconfidence/overreliance — excessive delegation. Complacency — a passive attitude or lack of active supervision. Inadvertent arming or engagement of an incorrect mode. Failure to verify the effective arming/engagement on the FMA of the modes armed or engaged. Selection of an incorrect target such as altitude, speed or heading on the flight guidance control panel and failure to confirm the selected target by cross-checking the related target symbol on the PFD and ND. Selection of the target altitude to any altitude below the minimum en route altitude (MEA), minimum off-route altitude (MORA), mimumum safe altitude (MSA), approach-segment safe altitude or final approach intercept altitude. Insertion of an erroneous waypoint. Arming of the lateral navigation mode with an incorrect “TO” waypoint. Preoccupation with FMS programming during a critical flight phase, with consequent loss of situational awareness. Insufficient understanding of mode transitions and mode reversions, mode confusion or an automation surprise. Inadequate task sharing and/or crew resource management (CRM) practices preventing the PF from monitoring the flight path and airspeed. An example is when both pilots are engaged in the management of automation or in solving an unanticipated situation or abnormal condition. Engaging the AP with the FD bars being largely off-center, such as after hand flying the aircraft without following FD orders. Engaging the AP with the aircraft in an out-of-trim condition (conventional aircraft models only). Failure to arm the approach mode. Failure to set the correct final approach course. Failure to set the correct go-around altitude.
