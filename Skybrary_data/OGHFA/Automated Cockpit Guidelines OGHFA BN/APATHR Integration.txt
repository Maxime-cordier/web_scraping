Integrated AP-A/THR systems feature a pairing of AP pitch modes (elevator control) and A/THR modes (throttle levers/thrust control). An integrated AP-A/THR operates in the same way as a human pilot: The elevator is used to control pitch attitude, airspeed, vertical speed, altitude, flight path angle and vertical navigation profile, or to capture and track a glideslope.. Throttles/thrust levers are used to maintain a given thrust or airspeed.. Throughout the flight, the pilotâ€™s objective is to fly: Performance segments (e.g., takeoff, climb ordescent) at constant thrust or at idle; or,. Trajectory segments (e.g., cruise or approach) at constant speed. Depending on the task to be accomplished, maintaining the airspeed is assigned either to the AP (elevator) or to the A/THR, as shown in Table 1. : A/THR: AP/FD: . Throttles/thrust levers. Elevators.
