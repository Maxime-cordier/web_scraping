Interruptions (e.g., due to ATC communications) and distractions (e.g., due to a conversation among others on the flight deck) occur frequently during flight. Some cannot be avoided and therefore must be coped with by the flight crew. Others can be minimized or eliminated through training, adoption of effective procedures, discipline and the use of good judgment. If the number of interruptions and distractions is not minimized or the impact of residual interruptions and distractions is not controlled, flight safety can be affected. In particular, when a flight crew is disturbed while monitoring or controlling the aircraft, errors can occur and go undetected. This Briefing Note discusses the causes and consequences of interruptions and distractions and describes techniques for reducing and dealing with them. The focus in this material is on actions for both individual flight crew members and their companies.
