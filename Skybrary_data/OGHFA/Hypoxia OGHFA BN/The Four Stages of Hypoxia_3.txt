explains why it is more useful to talk about effective performance time (EPT) rather than time of useful consciousness. It is difficult to estimate universal values for EPT due to individual variability influenced by endurance, experience, physical exercise and the situation under which exposure to high altitude has occurred. Two factors are crucial: the proportion of O2 in the inspired gas prior to the decompression and the level of metabolic activity at the time of decompression. Approximated values of time of useful consciousness under air or O2 breathing, and for these two conditions at rest or under moderate physical exercise are shown in Table 1. Figure 2 emphasises the deleterious effect of rapid decompression at high altitude on EPT. At the optimal level of cabin altitude of 2,500 m (8,000 ft), the pressure of O2 in the lungs and in the pulmonary vessels (PAO2 and PvO2, respectively) are equal to 96 and 40 hPa, such that O2 will flow from the lungs to the blood. Upon rapid decompression at 12,000 m (39,000 ft), PAO2 plummets so drastically and so quickly that it becomes lower than PvO2. As a result, there is an immediate reversal of oxygen flow from the blood to the lung within four to five seconds following the decompression. This depletes the bloodâ€™s oxygen reserve and reduces the EPT at rest by up to 50 percent. Loss of consciousness usually occurs within 10 seconds. However, loss of consciousness does not mean that breathing will stop. If a pilot puts the O2 mask on his face within the 5 seconds following the decompression, the lung pressure in O2 increases to an effective value (80 hPa) and as result, recovery from hypoxia occurs within seconds. Two operational consequences result from this phenomenon: When a transport aircraft flies above 7,600 m (25,000 ft), the rapidness of loss of consciousness makes it mandatory to provide the crew an O2 device that can be fitted on the face within five seconds. In case of cabin decompression, putting the mask on the face becomes an immediate and time critical emergency. It is mandatory that the crew be effectively trained with the procedures for donning the mask effectively. Crews must be conditioned to apply this procedure by reflex prior to taking any other action.. The threat of large variations in PAO2 following a decompression supports the delivery of a gas enriched in O2 into the cockpit in case of decompression when flying above 2,500 m (8,000 ft). If the inhaled air contains at least 40 percent additional oxygen, PAO2 will generally remain within proper limits when between 2,500 - 12,000 m (8,000 - 39,000 ft). FAR 121.33e in the U.S. requires that above 25,000 feet (7,600 m) one of the two pilots always be fitted with an O2 mask. If the O2 mask is of the quick-fitting type, it is required to be worn only above 41,000 ft (12,500 m)..
