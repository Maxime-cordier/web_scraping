One major US airline changed the title of "Pilot Not Flying" (PNF) to "Pilot Monitoring" (PM) to describe what the pilot should be doing versus what he or she is not doing. Also, monitoring responsibilities are now clearly spelled out. The PF will monitor/control the aircraft, regardless of the level of automation used, while the PM will monitor the aircraft and actions of the PF. In an effort to reduce runway incursions, the same airline is now requiring both pilots to have taxi charts available, and both to monitor the taxi clearance. When ATC issues a taxi clearance, the captain will verbalize any hold-short instructions to the first officer. When the aircraft approaches an active runway, both pilots will ensure the aircraft holds short before continuing with non-monitoring tasks such as FMS, Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System, company radio calls and checklists. Since a high rate of altitude deviations can be tied to poor flight crew monitoring, several of the major airlines are now recommending that during the last 1,000 feet of altitude change, both pilots focus on making sure the aircraft levels off at the assigned altitude.
