Attention is a cognitive process that is important to virtually every activity people perform. It is one of the most studied processes in cognitive psychology and neuroscience and is considered to be the gateway to perception and all other higher level cognitive processes. Without attention, we could not selectively process information and discriminate important information from the unimportant “noise” that surrounds us. In turn, because we can control our attention, we can be vigilant and be prepared for dangers when they arise. Over the last few years, attention and vigilance studies have become recognized as vitally important to human factors, especially in aviation, because of the growing use of automation in modern aircraft. Such automation requires less action but more monitoring on the part of the crew who must retain the ability to act when necessary if a situation arises. This type of monitoring activity requires a great deal of attention and vigilance on the part of the crew.
