Attention and vigilance are relatively fragile in nature and can be adversely affected by many factors. The primary factors that affect attention and vigilance and their consequences are presented below. One of the first experiments showing the effect of time on task on attention was conducted by Mackworth in 1950.[1] In this experiment, subjects were asked to watch a clock and detect every critical signal (the double jump of the needle) while ignoring the non-critical signals (the single jumps). Human operators were shown to have a limited ability to maintain vigilance over extended periods of time. Another important factor that may affect performance in a vigilance task is the rest to activity ratio. Figure 1 shows that a short rest activity cycle (20 minutes of activity/20 minutes of rest) is better than a long rest activity cycle (60 minutes of activity/60 minutes of rest) especially when alertness tends to be low, e.g., during night. Figure 1. Performance (reaction time in the detection of aircraft) of air traffic controllers as a function of the rest-activity cycle and, time of the day and time on task The effects of the frequency of critical and non-critical signals on vigilance have been tested and shown to be related to performance on a vigilance task. Figure 2 shows that a low number of critical signals significantly reduces performance (expressed in reaction time) during a vigilance task. Figure 3 demonstrates that the lower the number of non-critical signals per minute, the higher performance will be (expressed in percentage of detection). That is to say, more non-critical signals per minute results in greater distraction and greater difficulty in identifying critical signals. These results demonstrate that level of performance is significantly influenced by signal-to-noise ratio. Figure 2. Effects of the number of critical signals on vigilance. Figure 3.
