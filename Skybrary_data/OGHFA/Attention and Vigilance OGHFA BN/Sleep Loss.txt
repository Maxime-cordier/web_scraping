Sleep loss is known to affect performance on a wide variety of tasks. Related to attention, sleep loss has been shown to induce lapses. As an individual gets sleepy (s)he functions normally until a microsleep occurs, which leads to a lapse. The effects of sleep loss can often be seen very shortly after a task has been started. Akerstedt examined this effect in a 34-minute visual vigilance task given to twelve subjects every three hours over a 64-hour period without sleep. After 24 hours of being awake, even the very first sets of tests showed decrements in subject performance when compared to baseline measures where subjects were well-rested. These results demonstrate that there is no "safe" duration for a monotonous task if the situation is undemanding/boring and the subject has substantial sleep loss.
