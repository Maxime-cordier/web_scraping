Motion sickness in flight is termed airsickness. Air sickness is a normal response of some healthy individuals when exposed to a flight environment characterised by unfamiliar motion and orientation cues. Causes: Motion sickness arises from conflicting or mismatched sensory input (e.g., visual, vestibular and proprioceptive pathways). Symptoms: Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, cold sweating, skin pallor, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision. Predisposing factors to airsickness: Fatigue, alcohol, drugs, medications, stress, illnesses, anxiety, fear and insecurity can increase individual susceptibility to motion sickness.. Airsickness is uncommon among experienced pilots, but it does occur with some frequency among student pilots.. Low mental workload during exposure to an unfamiliar motion has been implicated as a predisposing factor for airsickness. A pilot who concentrates on the mental tasks required to fly an aircraft will be less likely to become airsick.. Preventing and coping with airsickness: Repeated exposure to the flight environment decreases an individualâ€™s susceptibility to airsickness.. Pilots who are susceptible to airsickness should not take anti-motion sickness medications. Research has shown that most anti-motion sickness medications cause a temporary deterioration of navigational skills.. A pilot who starts to feel airsick should avoid unnecessary head movements, open air vents, loosen clothing, use supplemental oxygen and keep the eyes focused on a point outside the aircraft..
