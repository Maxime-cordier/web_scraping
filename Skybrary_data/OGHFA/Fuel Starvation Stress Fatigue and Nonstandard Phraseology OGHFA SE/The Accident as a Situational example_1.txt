You are the first officer on an international flight toward a congested area. It is your second sector. The flight is scheduled to arrive at night. As the flight proceeds to the destination, it is placed in holding three times by air traffic control (ATC) due to bad weather and heavy traffic. Total holding time has exceeded 1 hour 15 minutes when the en route controller advises you to expect further clearance in 20 minutes. What is your strategy for landing? You respond that you will need priority handling because you cannot hold longer than 5 more minutes, are running out of fuel and cannot reach your alternate airport. After consulting with approach control as to whether it could accept the aircraft, the en route controller clears you to your destination and instructs you to contact approach control. You are given routine radar service, including descents to lower altitudes and heading changes to sequence you with other airplanes. The controller also informs you of wind shear. Fully aware of the fuel shortage, you begin to discuss the procedure for a go-around, with less than 1,000 lb (454 kg) of fuel in the tanks. During the approach, a little more than 30 minutes later, the ground-proximity warning system (GPWS) starts triggering multiple warnings. How do you react to the warnings? The captain orders a go-around. You are subsequently cleared for a new arrival track, and the final approach controller asks if this new track is all right with you regarding fuel. Approximately 5 minutes later, and only miles from the outer marker for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach, all four engines flame out due to fuel starvation. The aircraft hits a hillside in a residential area. There is no fire. Among the people aboard the aircraft, almost half are killed, and the others are seriously injured, except for a few who suffer only minor injuries. 2 Data, Discussion and Human Factors Investigators determined that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the pilots to manage the fuel load and their failure to communicate an emergency fuel situation to ATC before fuel exhaustion occurred. Wind shear, crew fatigue and stress were factors that led to the unsuccessful completion of the first approach, and thus also contributed to the accident Fuel Management Investigators found a series of inadequacies in the dispatching services of the airline and in the flight plan issued to the crew. Despite this, sufficient fuel was loaded at the departure airport to complete the flight safely, and it was the flight crew that did not properly manage the fuel in flight. The dispatch function plays a critical role in operations planning and flight conduct, especially for situations involving deteriorating weather and ATC delays. In these situations, the dispatcher can help the pilots manage their fuel and provide assistance in their decision making about the most prudent actions to ensure safety of flight. That evening, numerous other flight crews who were waiting for clearances had contacted their
