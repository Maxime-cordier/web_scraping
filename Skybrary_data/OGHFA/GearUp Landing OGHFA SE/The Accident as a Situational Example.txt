The crew comprises a very experienced captain and instructor who is relatively new to the airline, you, the first officer, flying your last initial operating experience (IOE) flight, and the flight engineer, on his first flight after type qualification. One hour after takeoff, an oil leak forces you to shut down the no. 1 engine and to return to the departure airport. You are the pilot flying. The flight proceeds normally until the final approach. The landing gear warning sounds when the flaps are extended to 25 degrees. The captain comments about this, and the flight engineer remarks about extending the flaps simultaneously with the alarms ringing. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) require the captain to ask the flight engineer to check the five lights on his panel. The captain asks, casually, “How many lights do you have back there?” and the engineer replies, “Four greens.” After checking the backup system, the captain confirms this status in a monotonous voice. He believes the landing gear is extended correctly and proceeds with the final approach. You are concentrating on flying the approach and believe the same, without paying too much attention to the conversation. However, the approach speed is 26 kt above target, the flaps are still extending and the landing checklist has been interrupted by the alarm. The approach is not stabilized, but the captain decides to proceed due to the long runway available and because you have another rotation after this flight and you are approaching your maximum duty time. A few seconds later, the main landing gear touches the runway, but the nose landing gear is not extended. The airplane skids on its nose for about 800 m (2,625 ft) and comes to a complete stop on the runway centerline, without any injuries to the passengers or crew.
