To mitigate the risks associated with bad food and inadequate preparation, it is the responsibility of the crew to choose the proper restaurant when off duty. Most international hotel chains where crews stay between flights offer good quality food. To further reduce the risk of food poisoning, airlines often recommend that crewmembers chose different menu items when eating together, just as in flight where the captain and first officer get different meals. It is often said that the main protection against accidents includes the following: High level of technical skills;. Strict adherence to procedures;. Reduction of distractions;. Proper and timely decision making;. Conscious and renewed situational awareness; and,. Crew coordination and mutual backup.. However, critical errors are still made. One possible way to mitigate their consequences is to detect and recover from them before it is too late, and disseminate any findings throughout the community to avoid a repetition. This must be done in a positive way, not in order to assign blame or to find a culprit. People do not commit errors on purpose. The following principles of error management may aid prevention: Recognize that we, as human beings, make mistakes.. Apply standard operating procedures (SOPs).. Manage available resources, increase redundancy and decrease workload.. Make other team members aware of risks and intentions.. Evaluate the consequences of an action before undertaking it.. A conscious safety culture enables organizations to identify and manage risk through a formalized approach that identifies issues, corrects them and ensures they stay fixed. Formalizing risk management is imperative as we move from an after-the-fact accident investigation approach, to a diagnostic and more predictive one. We also need to share what we learn.
