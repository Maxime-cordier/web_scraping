Disciplined use of SOPs and normal checklists should begin during the transition training course because habits and routines acquired during transition training have been proved to have lasting effect. Transition training and recurrent training provide unique opportunities to discuss both the reasons for rules and procedures and the consequences of failing to comply with them. Conversely, allowing relaxed adherence to SOPs and/or a relaxed use of normal checklists during initial or recurrent simulator training may encourage corresponding deviations during line operations. Both the airline and the individual pilot must remember to: Train as you fly, fly as you train!
