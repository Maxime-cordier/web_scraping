To ensure effective compliance with published SOPs, it is important to understand why pilots intentionally or inadvertently deviate from rules or standards. In most cases of deviation from SOPs, the procedure that was followed in place of the published procedure seemed to be appropriate for the prevailing situation, considering the information available at the time. But, in fact, it was inappropriate or at least suboptimal. The following factors and conditions are often cited as making it more likely that a deviation from SOPs will occur: Corporate culture (e.g., the absence of company managementâ€™s clear commitment to SOPs and standardization). Ineffective or unclear company or airworthiness authority policies (e.g., regarding schedules, costs, go around, diversion, crew duty time). Inadequate knowledge of or failure to understand the rule, procedure or action. (e.g., quality of wording or phrasing; rule, procedure or action being perceived as inappropriate) Insufficient emphasis on strict adherence to SOPs during transition and recurrent training. Insufficient vigilance (e.g., due to fatigue). Distractions (e.g., due to cockpit activity). Interruptions (e.g., due to ATC communication). Task saturation resulting in degraded multi-tasking ability or task overload. Incorrect management of priorities (e.g., lack of or incorrect decision-making model for time-critical situations). Reduced attention (e.g., due to tunnel vision) in abnormal or high-workload conditions. Incorrect CRM techniques, especially the absence of cross-checking, crew coordination or effective backup. Personal desires or constraints (e.g., personal schedule, press-on-itis). Complacency. Overconfidence. The awareness that these factors can influence adherence to SOPs may be useful to you in assessing your company and personal exposure, and in developing corresponding prevention strategies and lines of defense.
