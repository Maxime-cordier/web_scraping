the first officer has entered in the flight management system (FMS), while you remain pilot flying. The diversion is made easier by the use of radar vectoring during descent with clear and concise English from the controller. Prior to 40W, the LOC/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) Automatic Direction Finding approach is reviewed in detail. The crew notes 2,800-ft terrain close to the airport and that, although the engine-out route for takeoff calls for a left turn, the missed approach requires a right turn. The approach chart shows several fixes with altitude constraints, with only three listed in the FMS at 15 nm, 8.7 nm and 2.6 nm with altitudes of 3,300 ft, 3,100 ft and 476 ft. ATC offers an early localizer intercept at your discretion. The signal is well received to follow the north shore of a fjord with excellent daylight visibility of terrain with steep hills. The runway is 9,500 ft (2,896 m) long and has a pronounced upward slope for a quarter of its length, making it appear short, with a precision approach path indicator (PAPI) on the left. The airport, which is well equipped to deal with such unplanned occurrences, cooperates fully. Inspection of the engine later shows a rupture between the main oil filter and the engine supply line, with 4 L (4 qt) of oil remaining after shutdown. Although the engine was not shut down during the incident flight — so as not to spoil extended operations (ETOPS) statistics — no damage resulted.
