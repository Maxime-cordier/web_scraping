This incident was well managed. The crew had lots of time to think and used this time productively. Even though the captain almost decided not to divert or to delay a diversion, the collective approach helped to implement the group decision as soon as necessary: The crew first had to ponder whether the oil quantity loss was a real problem or just an indication problem.. The crew then reviewed ETOPS diversion alternatives taking into account weather, airport characteristics and airplane condition.. The crew then collectively set up decision criteria as to when to divert, based on any additional problem such as oil pressure or temperature dropping.. When the critical additional problem became apparent, the pilots were entirely ready to implement the next step â€” that is, where and how to divert without pressure or haste..
