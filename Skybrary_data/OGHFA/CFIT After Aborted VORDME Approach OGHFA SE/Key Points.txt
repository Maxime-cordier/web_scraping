This accident was caused by poor coordination between ATC and the pilots, the crew‘s loss of situational awareness, the crew’s head-down attitude, inadequate CRM and language difficulties with ATC. The flight crew built an erroneous mental picture of the flight path. This accident might have been prevented if they had taken known steps to restore their situational awareness. In this situation, a focus on human factors issues reveals the importance of: Maintaining situational awareness at all times and assessing whether available information is sufficient to support mission goals.. Comparing the “outside” world with the “inside” world.. Checking the approach charts carefully and strictly following SOPs.. Allowing sufficient time to prepare for essential aspects of flight management such as studying the approach chart and conducting efficient briefings as a team.. Actively seeking information and challenging others and one’s own mental picture.. Performing dynamic decision making using all elements of technical knowledge and taking into account the operational facts of the situation.. Working together as a team to make appropriate decisions, taking into account the operational facts and actively seeking contributions from each other.. The first officer continuously monitoring flight progress and challenging the captain whenever he/she finds a reason to do so. No matter how experienced the captain, he should know that he is not always able to perceive the entire ongoing situation. The captain is also responsible for managing the first officer as a reliable resource..
