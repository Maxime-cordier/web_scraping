The crew lost situational awareness by not seeking and using all pertinent information from the controller and by failing to check and cross-check actions. In order to prevent the accident, the crew should have focused more on adherence to SOPs, using standard phraseology and preparing an effective briefing for the go-around maneuver. At the very least, they should have: Worked as a team to perform an accurate risk assessment based on the: Navigation display. Go-around trajectories. Clearly defined roles in relation to outside observation.. Navigation display.. Go-around trajectories.. Clearly defined roles in relation to outside observation.. Explicitly defined the task-sharing so it was clear who would monitor the DME distance and the radial from the VOR as related to altitude.. The crew also should have sought clearer information from ATC. They needed additional time to build situational awareness since they were rushed after sorting the flap problem. Applicable principles that would have helped them include: Actively searching for new information from all available sources since they were missing information to build situational awareness.. Communicating with each other to make sure that they worked as a team. Instead, they fixed attention on entering data into the FMS.. Using the resources available more effectively. In particular, the captain should have sought inputs from his first officer.. Focusing more attention on navigation. Particular attention should have been given to cross-checking the instrument data available with outside visual cues.. Call out and cross-check altitude and DME distance and radial according to SOPs since they were flying an unfamiliar track..
