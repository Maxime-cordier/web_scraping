Nearly a hundred sleep disorders are classified into four categories. This section focuses on the most common problems such as: Insomnia. Sleep apnoea. Narcolepsy. Periodic limb movement (Restless Leg Syndrome). Parasomnia.. Diagnosis and treatment are beyond the scope of this section.

Insomnia is not generally considered a disorder; rather it is more of a symptom or complaint. Insomnia is characterized by both a lack of sleep and excessive worry about sleep disturbances.

Feeling anxious, worried, depressed or irritable, especially at bedtime. Feeling physically or mentally tired during the day. Daytime sleepiness. Impaired concentration. Impaired memory. Types of insomnia: Causes: Transient insomnia: Lasting for only a few nights Short-term insomnia: Two or four weeks of poor sleep.

Chronic insomnia: Poor sleep most nights and lasting a month or longer. Often results from a combination of the above factors related to transient and short-term insomnia. One of the most common causes of chronic insomnia is depression. Other causes: arthritis, kidney disease, heart failure, asthma, sleep problems (e.g., apnoea), behavioural factors (e.g., caffeine or alcohol consumption).

Sleep apnoea describes a condition in which breathing stops for brief periods throughout the night. Each pause in breathing typically lasts 10 to 20 seconds or longer in some cases. These pauses can occur 20 to 30 times an hour. Sleep apnoea occurs when the muscles at the base of the throat relax, resulting in loud snoring and laboured breathing. When complete blockage of the airway occurs, breathing stops or is impaired so drastically that the individual is prevented from reaching the deeper stages of sleep, which results in extreme daytime drowsiness. The most common symptoms are: Loud snoring. Morning headaches. Trouble staying awake during the day. Memory or learning problems. Feeling irritable/depressed. Not being able to concentrate on work. Dry throat when waking up. Frequent urination at night. Waking up sweating. Types of sleep apnea: Causes: Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The upper airway can be obstructed by excess tissue in the airway (e.g., large tonsils, large tongue), and usually includes airway muscles relaxing and collapsing when asleep. Another site of obstruction can be the nasal passages.. usage of alcohol or sedatives before sleep anatomically narrow airways enlarged tonsils or adenoids overweight/obesity. usage of alcohol or sedatives before sleep. anatomically narrow airways. enlarged tonsils or adenoids. overweight/obesity.
