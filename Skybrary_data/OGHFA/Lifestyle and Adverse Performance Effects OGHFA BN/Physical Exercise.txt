Regular physical exercise improves tolerance to environmental stressors in aeronautics and decreases the duration of post-flight recovery. Three one-hour sessions per week or 15-minute daily workouts are recommended. To improve general physical fitness, all types of endurance activities (e.g., cycling, swimming, jogging, tennis) are recommended. To improve piloting performance (and to avoid any back or neck pain), physical training should focus on the postural muscles (cervical, back, abdominal and thigh muscles). Just prior to a flight (about 10 minutes) you should “wake up” your muscles in order to avoid any muscular tension while on board. Muscular stretching during the flight is also beneficial. Following a flight, stretching exercises can be very beneficial. However, it is best to wait two hours after landing before engaging in endurance types of exercise for relaxation or fitness. If your flight is scheduled in the morning, engage in endurance exercise at the end of the day. The reverse is not true, however, if you are scheduled for an afternoon flight. When flying afternoons, you should refrain from strenuous exercise that morning.
