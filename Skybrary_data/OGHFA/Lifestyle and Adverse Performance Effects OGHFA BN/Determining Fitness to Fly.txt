Your doctor and flight surgeon do not see you daily. They depend on you to seek them out when you think you have a health condition. On a day-to-day basis, however, you have to determine if you are fit to fly or should seek medical attention. If you think of the following question and answer, it will help you make a good decision. Am I fit to fly?” Yes, I‘M SAFE! I. Illness. Am I ill? Do I feel sick in any way?. M. Medication. I take drugs: will they impair my thinking, judgment or performance?. S. Stress. Am I mentally fit? Can I devote my full attention to flying?. A. Alcohol. When did I take the last drink? Am I suffering hangover effects?. F. Fatigue. Am I physically fatigued? Am I too tired to give 100%?. E. Eating. Am I hungry? Did I eat too much? Do I have indigestion?. This simple mnemonic, I’M SAFE, is a checklist to help you remember the main lifestyle risk factors that might impair your performance during flight.
