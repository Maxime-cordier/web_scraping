flying after taking a prescription or OTC drug. I can take a medication that has been prescribed to another member of my family or a friend suffering from the same symptoms. Wrong! The same symptoms can be related to different conditions, and each person may react to a given drug differently. The first few doses of the medicine I was prescribed did not cure my problem. I think I should double the dose or add another medicine. Wrong! There is an optimal dose for all medicines. Increasing the dose without a flight surgeon’s permission can be dangerous to your health and might impair your piloting abilities. Combinations of drugs can produce unpredictable reactions. Always check with your flight surgeon before mixing medicines. A little use of illicit drugs is not dangerous as long as I do it well before flight. Illicit drugs are dangerous to your health and your career. First, you never really know what is contained in drugs purchased illegally. You could be getting anything—even a dangerous poison. Second, the traces of some drugs such as marijuana, can remain in your system for days or even weeks and will be detected by drug tests.
