Developing a positive taxonomy is useless if safety investigators and analysts do not contribute to it. Assessing positive factors in addition to looking for the causal elements of a situation can influence the way an occurrence, particularly an incident that did not turn into an accident, is considered. Relevant questions that are typically not included when only looking for causes include: Why did this incident not turn into an accident?. Was there equipment, a decision or a procedure that prevented an accident from occurring?. In case of an accident, could it have been more serious?. What prevented it from resulting in more serious damage or injuries?. Were the results of this occurrence simply a matter of chance or did some prior factor predispose a more positive outcome?. Were there any positive human factors that mediated the outcome?.
