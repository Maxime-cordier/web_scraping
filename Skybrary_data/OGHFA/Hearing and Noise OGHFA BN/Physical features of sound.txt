Sound is a vibration that is transmitted through various media such as air or water. Sound is simply a series of compressions (where molecules are dense) and rarefactions (where molecules are sparse). A vibration will move at different speeds depending on the medium. In air at sea level (20 C, 68F), the speed of sound is approximately 343 m/s; in water (20 C) at sea level, the speed is 1,482 m/s. Sound waves travel outward in all directions from their source until they are blocked. As a wave, sound has two main characteristics, frequency and amplitude, and a vibration occurs over a single wavelength. Frequency is typically expressed in Hertz (Hz), a measure of how many vibrations occur in one second, and directly corresponds to the pitch of a sound (Table 1). For example, a pure sine wave of 440 Hz corresponds to the note A on the fourth octave of the piano. The higher the frequency the higher the pitch. When measuring sound in air, sound pressure level is almost always expressed in decibels (Figure 1). The logarithmic decibel scale uses a reference sound pressure of 20 micro pascals (Î¼Pa) which is considered the threshold of human hearing and is roughly equivalent to the sound of a piece of paper falling to the ground. Most measurements of audio equipment are made relative to this reference point. Frequency range: Examples: Infrasonic (<20 Hz). Inaudible to humans. Low bass (20 to 80 Hz). Explosions, thunder and the lowest notes of a musical organ. Upper bass (80 to 320 Hz). Drum kit, cello, trombone and bass. Mid-range (320 to 2,560 Hz). Much of the richness of instrumental sounds occur in this range. Upper mid-range (2,560 to 5,120 Hz). Frequency for which the human ear is the most sensitive; contributes to the intelligibility of speech. Treble (5,120 to 20,000 Hz). Brilliance or "air" of a sound, but can also emphasize noise. Ultrasonic (>20,000 Hz). Inaudible to humans.
