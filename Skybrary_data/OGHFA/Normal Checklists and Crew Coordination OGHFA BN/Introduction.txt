Strict adherence to standard operating procedures (Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)) can eliminate or at least mitigate the adverse effects of various operational factors and human errors that can lead to incidents and accidents. The unfailing and correct use of normal checklists is an important SOP and an essential part of good flight crew discipline. Every flight crew should appreciate the importance of normal checklists and crew coordination.
