This Briefing Note (BN) describes the mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms and the effects of circadian rhythms on pilot performance. The information should help flight crews develop strategies to cope with the effects of flight operations on circadian rhythms. This BN describes: Data on the relationship between circadian rhythms and performance. The biological clock that controls the circadian variations in biological and behavioral functions. The practical implication of circadian rhythms for night operations and transmeridian (across time zones) flights..
