Many human biological and behavioral functions vary regularly and systematically over a period of about 24 hours. These variations are called circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms persist even in the absence of all environmental and social time cues. Circadian rhythms are internally generated by a self-sustaining or autonomous biological clock located in the hypothalamus. In the absence of all time cues, the biological clock has a natural cycle of about 25 hours. With normal time cues, however, the biological clock is reset each day such that it is in synchrony with the solar day.. Changes in work shifts and transmeridian flight result in asynchrony between a crewmemberâ€™s circadian rhythms and both work requirements and environmental time cues. This lack of synchrony results in shift-lag syndrome (due to changes in work schedule) and jet-lag syndrome (due to transmeridian flights). The biological clock and the associated circadian variations adapt slowly following changes in the work schedule and following transmeridian flights. Adaptation after eastbound travel is about 50 percent slower than after westbound flight -- adaptation time following eastbound travel is about 1.5 days for each time zone change whereas adaptation time following westbound travel is about one day for each time zone change. The adaptation rate is not the same for all of the circadian biological and behavioral variations. The resultant disharmony among these functions contributes to jet-lag syndrome..
