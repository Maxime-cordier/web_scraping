As pointed out by the investigation, the core factor contributing to this incident was the loss of situational awareness. The crew did not succeed in detecting this because they did not react to the clues that indicated their loss of awareness: The feeling that the descent was premature and hasty.. Confusion about the arrival procedure.. VOR missing on the approach chart.. ATIS not received.. Wrong ILS frequency.. Difference of four tons in fuel level.. Most of these unresolved discrepancies and confusions were not shared among the crewmembers. Fatigue and press-on-itis contributed. Prevention strategies can be found in the Situational Awareness Checklist and can be summarized as follows: Assess factors reducing situational awareness: time pressure, fatigue.. Be on the lookout for clues of degraded situational awareness: Ambiguity — Unclear flight plans or ATC instructions. Confusion — Uncertainty or misunderstanding a situation or information. Unresolved discrepancies — Contradictory data or personal conflicts. Expected checkpoints not met — Flight plan, profile, time, fuel burn. Poor communications — Vague or incomplete statements. No time — Falling behind the aircraft.. Ambiguity — Unclear flight plans or ATC instructions.. Confusion — Uncertainty or misunderstanding a situation or information.. Unresolved discrepancies — Contradictory data or personal conflicts.. Expected checkpoints not met — Flight plan, profile, time, fuel burn.. Poor communications — Vague or incomplete statements.. No time — Falling behind the aircraft.. Finally, stick to standard phraseology and request clarification of ATC transmissions that are not compliant with the ICAO standard.
