Factors involved in this situational example include training, discipline and nonadherence to procedures, which led the pilots to run out of fuel and divert in flight: The safety net in maintenance activities could not prevent a faulty engine replacement.. The mismatched installation caused the fuel and hydraulic tubes to come into contact, which resulted in a fracture of the fuel tube and a fuel leak.. The flight crew did not detect that a fuel problem existed until an advisory message was displayed and a fuel imbalance was noted on the ECAM.. The crew did not correctly evaluate the situation before taking action.. The crew carried out an inappropriate procedure from memory, which resulted in extra fuel loss.. High workload and confirmation bias made the crew stick to its initial belief and ignore the fuel leak until engine flameout..
