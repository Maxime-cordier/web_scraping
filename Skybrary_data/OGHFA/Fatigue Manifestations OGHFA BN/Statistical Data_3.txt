people do not like to believe that their performance is degraded but will readily point out when the performance of others has declined. Attitudes towards interpersonal conflicts and situational awareness are the non-technical skills most affected by fatigue. When pilots are tired, they generally perform poorly when interpersonal conflicts arise. This poor performance is usually a result of an inability to remain focused on the problem or situation at hand. Often pilots will not listen actively to the ideas and opinions of others, admit mistakes or identify and resolve conflicts. Loss of situational awareness is related to a lack of vigilance and a reduction in active monitoring, scanning and cross-checking. You may have difficulty in activities such as attending to radio calls, making accurate switch settings, making or listening to altitude call-outs and meeting crossing restrictions. If you lack the essential information normally obtained by performing these activities effectively, you will have difficulty making good judgements and decisions. The various physical and mental manifestations of fatigue ultimately lead to pilot error. When you are tired, the probability of making errors increases particularly in the following situations: Difficult flights (e.g., high-density zone crossing, unfavourable weather, technical problems). During a high density of verbal exchanges (e.g., simultaneous or continuous solicitations from air traffic control, cabin crew and/or cockpit crew-members). Executing actions in a limited amount of time (e.g., cockpit preparation before the flight, system monitoring under time pressure)..
