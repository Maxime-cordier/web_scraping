Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency (the “Basic Regulation” for EASA) defines a qualified entity as follows: ‘qualified entity’ shall mean a body which may be allocated a specific certification task by, and under the control and the responsibility of, the Agency or a national aviation authority. Article 13 of the ‘Basic Regulation’, referring specifically to Qualified Entities, states: When allocating a specific certification task to a qualified entity, the Agency or the national aviation authority concerned shall ensure that such entity comply with the criteria laid down in Annex V. The role of Qualified Entity is therefore viewed in the context of provision of support to EASA, specifically in the field of certification activities. The criteria in Annex V of the Basic Regulation determining the suitability of an Agency or a national aviation authority to act as a Qualified Entity (QE) have therefore been specified accordingly and, inter alia, require: The independence of the QE from the design, manufacture, marketing or maintenance of the products, parts, appliances, constituents or systems or in their operations, service provision or use;. The possession by the QE of the greatest possible professional integrity and the greatest possible technical competence;. The freedom from any pressure and incentive, in particular of a financial type, which could affect their judgment or the results of their investigations, in particular from persons, or groups of persons, affected by the results of the certification tasks;. The employment of adequate staff, qualified, knowledgeable and experienced in certification tasks, as well as the means required to perform adequately the technical and administrative tasks linked with the certification process..
