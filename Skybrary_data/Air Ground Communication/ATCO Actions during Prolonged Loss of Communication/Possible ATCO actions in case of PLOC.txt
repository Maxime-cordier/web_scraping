Transmit blind on all the frequencies available on which the aircraft is supposed to be listening. Use other aircraft to attempt to relay messages to the aircraft suffering PLOC. Monitor 121.5 MHz constantly. Check with the upstream ATC unit whether the aircraft has been tranferred correctly. Forward information about the Radio Communication Failure (RCF) to relevant downstream ATS units. Check the flight plan for alternate aerodromes and other relevant information as level, route and speed changes, etc. En-route: separate the aircraft with RCF from the other traffic as appropriate. On approach: allow for a long final to be flown and hold all departures and arrivals. At the airport: keep the active runway clear. If the aircraft is approaching restricted, danger or prohibited airspace, ensure that a timely alert is passed to the appropriate military or other authority.
