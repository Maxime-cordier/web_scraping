Airâ€“ground communications is a key component for the safe and expeditious operation of aircraft. Conversely, a loss of communication can result in undesirable and sometimes unsafe situations. A prolonged loss of communication (PLOC) additionally creates a security concern and could result in military response measures, e.g. the activation of armed fighter aircraft (Quick Reaction Alert, QRA). The awareness of all stakeholders is required to avoid such incidents and to emphasise actions for a timely recovery of communications if a loss of communication should have happened. The following promotion material is available for all stakeholders to promote the issue and help reduce occurrences. Different forms of promotion and extent allow for a tailored distribution.
