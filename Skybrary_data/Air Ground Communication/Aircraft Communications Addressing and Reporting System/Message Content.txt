ACARS messages may be of three types based upon their content: Air Traffic Control (ATC). Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC). Airline Administrative Control (AAC). ATC messages include aircraft requests for clearances and ATC issue of clearances and instructions to aircraft. They are often used to deliver Pre-Departure, Datalink ATIS and en route Oceanic Clearances. However, whilst the ACARS system is currently fulfilling a significant 'niche' role in ATC communications, it is not seen as a suitable system for the more widespread ATC use of datalink referred to as Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC). AOC and AAC messages are used for communications between an aircraft and its base. These messages may be of standard form or as defined by users, but all must then meet at least the guidelines of ARINC Standard 618. Any message content is possible including such examples as: upload to the aircraft of final load and trim sheets;. upload of weather or NOTAM information;. download from the aircraft of status, position, eta, and any diversion;. download of spot weather observations from aircraft sensors:. download of technical performance data including automatically triggered exceedance or abnormal aircraft system status information, and. 'housekeeping' information such as catering uplift requirements, special passenger advice and ETA.. Free Text messaging is also possible.
