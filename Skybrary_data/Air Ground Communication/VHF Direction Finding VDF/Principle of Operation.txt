The receiving antenna of a VDF consists of several (3 or more) elements mounted around a pole. CopyrightCreated by SKYbrary author Each element receives the same signal but at a slightly different time (i.e. they receive different phases at the same time). This allows the system to calculate the direcion from which the signal has been received. An example of an antenna with three elements is shown below: CopyrightCreated by SKYbrary author The explanation below illustrates the priciple of how phase (time) difference of the received signal helps to determine the direction of the transmitting station. The dotted lines consist of equidistant point in relation to each of the elements. Thus, the space is divided into six areas. The signal is received by element 1 first, then by element 2 and finaly by element 3, this means that: Since element 1 receives the signal before element 2, the source is in one of the areas II, III or IV. Since element 2 receives the signal before elemen 3, the source is in one of the areas I, II or VI. Since element 1 receives the signal before element 3, the source is in one of the areas I, II or III. The only area that fulfills all three conditions is area II, hence the aircraft is east of the VDF. Real systems take into account the precise phase (time) differences, which allows them to calculate the bearing of the signal rather than just the general direction. Depending on the particular implementation (e.g. number of antenna elements), the accuracy of bearing determination may vary. ICAO classifies the accuracy as follows: Class A - within 2 degrees. Class B - within 5 degrees. Class C - within 10 degrees. Class D - worse than Class C. Similarly, the classification of estimated position accuracy (when an array of VDFs is used) is made in accordance with the following: Class A - within 5 NM. Class B - within 20 NM. Class C - within 50 NM. Class D - worse than Class C.
