If the intercepting aircraft is/are equipped with an altitude encoding transponder which is left active during the approach to the target, then the first indication the intercepted aircraft will have of the interception may be on the TCAS display. If an approach is obsrved, especially from behind, it is suggested that a response to any consquent TCAS RA may be inappropriate. See the example given at ACAS Bulletin 9. Once visual contact with intercepting aircraft is available, usually as they arrive alongside from behind, the intercepted aircraft should set the TCAS to TA.
