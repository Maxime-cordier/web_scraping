Controllers are trained to plan the situation well in advance to achieve smooth flow of air traffic. This sometimes means that the clearances have to be complied with without delay. There are also situations where things do not happen as intended, and prompt action becomes necessary. Examples of such situations are: Aircraft being unable to maintain the assigned level due to turbulence. Emergency descent. Unexpected aircraft maneuver (e.g. due to weather avoidance). Inadequate coordination between ATS sectors or units. Wrong ATC clearance or instruction (e.g. due to situation misjudgment). ATC clearance or instruction not properly complied with, including delayed pilot action. Airspace infringement. Runway incursion. The most commonly used words to indicate that a situation requires prompt action for safety reasons are “now”, “immediately” and “expedite”.
