For all ATC / Flight Crew communications, the first priority is to establish an 'operational context' that distinguishes the following elements: Purpose - clearance, instruction, statement or proposal, question or request, confirmation;. When - immediately, anticipate, expect;. What and How - altitude (climb, descend, maintain), heading (left, right), airspeed; and,. Where - (at [â€¦] waypoint).. The content of initial and subsequent messages should support this 'operational context' by: Following the chronological order of the actions;. Grouping instructions and numbers related to each action; and,. Limiting the number of instructions in the transmission.. The last point is of great importance, especially now that RTF frequencies have up to three decimal places, which has significantly added to the potential complexity of multiple insruction tranmissions and their correct recording and read back by flight crew. The intonation, the speed of speaking and the placement and duration of pauses may affect the understanding of any communication, whether in abbreviated or plain language.
