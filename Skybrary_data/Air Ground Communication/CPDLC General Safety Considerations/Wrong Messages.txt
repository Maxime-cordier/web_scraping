Background: With CPDLC it is much easier (compared to using voice) to transmit a message to an aircraft. Safety issue(s): With CPDLC it is possible to transmit a wrong message to an aircraft or to transmit a message to the wrong aircraft. Defences: In case a wrong uplink message has been used, controllers should quickly resolve the situation, preferably using voice (e.g. (call sign) DISREGARD CPDLC MESSAGE, (new instruction)). An attempt to use CPDLC to correct the previous message can easily lead to ambiguity or another error.
