Background: Use of CPDLC frees up the frequency and generally helps reduce miscommunication (e.g. due to similar callsigns). Safety issue(s): The use of CPDLC reduces pilotsâ€™ situational awareness as they cannot follow the data link communication between the controller and other aircraft. Defences: Depending on circumstances, voice can be preferred over CPDLC for situations where multiple aircraft are involved in a potential conflict.
