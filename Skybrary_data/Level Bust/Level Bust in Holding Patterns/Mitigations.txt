Accurate pilot-ATCO communication and adherence to flight clearance is essential when descending in a holding pattern because the overlay of aircraft data labels on the ATCOâ€™s radar display may not allow the immediate detection of an impending traffic conflict. The usual ATC safety-net of STCA is likely to be less effective. Properly used, ACAS provides an effective safety net. However, if a RA in the hold is not accurately followed and/or a return to the cleared level is not made immediately "clear of conflict" is annunciated, then the likelihood of a secondary loss of separation is increased by the probable presence of other nearby traffic 1000ft above and 1000ft below the assigned level. Multiple aircraft ACAS events are possible in a stack and have been recorded. It is crucial that all aircraft receiving a TCAS RA when in a holding pattern follow the RA strictly.
