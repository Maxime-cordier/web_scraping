Aircraft is cleared to descend below the transition level in the hold and pilot forgets to set QNH. (Altimeter setting procedures).. ATCO issues descent clearance to the wrong aircraft, perhaps due to call sign confusion.. Pilot takes a clearance intended for another aircraft, perhaps due to call sign confusion.. Two aircraft in the hold are issued with descent clearances. The lower aircraft descends too slowly or the higher aircraft descends too quickly. (controllers should note that, in the managed mode, FMS provides for 1000 fpm rate of descent). Pilot is slow to initiate descent following a reclearance..
