In Russia and parts of Central Asia including Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), level flight above the transition altitude is accomplished at the assigned flight level with reference to, and clearances given in, feet (eg. FL330) However, altitudes below the transition level are assigned in metres. Aircraft can fly at the assigned altitude using an altimeter that indicates in metres or, if fitted with altimeters that read in feet, by conversion of the assigned altitude/level. Conversion tables are published on the outer leaf of en-route charts and usually also published in the company ops manuals of operators who regularly operate in this region. Flight Level to metres conversion table based on the semi-circular system relative to the true meridian. Source ICAO Annex 2 Note also that metric altitudes are used elsewhere in Europe by some airspace users, mainly by gliders. See appropriate AIPs for further information.
