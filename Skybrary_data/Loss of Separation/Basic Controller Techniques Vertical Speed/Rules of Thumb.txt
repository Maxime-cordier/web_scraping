Vertical speed of 2000 ft/min gives 10 FLs in 5 minutes. Vertical speed of 2500 ft/min gives 10 FLs in 4 minutes. Combined vertical speed of 4000 ft/min (e.g. RoD 2500 and RoC 1500) gives 20 FLs in 5 minutes. Note: Combined vertical speed is the sum of the vertical speeds of a climbing and a descending aircraft, e.g. if aircraft A is climbing at 1500 ft/min and aircraft B is descending at 2000 ft/min, then the combined vertical speed is 3500 ft/min.
