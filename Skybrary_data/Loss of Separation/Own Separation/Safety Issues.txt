There are two major safety issues with the use of own separation: Sometimes the relevant ICAO SARPs are not correctly applied, e.g. because they have not been clearly understood or some circumstances have been misinterpreted.. Sometimes own separation is not compatible with ACAS logic.. Own separation is NOT to be used: On controller's initiative;. In airspace classes A, B and C;. At night;. In IMC;. Above 10,000 ft;. If all aircraft are maintaining their level;. If the use of own separation is not agreed by all pilots concerned..
