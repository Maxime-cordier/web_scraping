is mitigated by adjusting the transmitted energy and the antenna rotation speed.. Minimum range limit. The PSR operates on one frequency which means that it cannot emit and receive signal at the same time. If the target is too close to the radar antenna, the reflected signal may be received before the end of the transmission. If that happens, the target will not be detected. Note that shortening the pulse will also reduce the amount of emitted energy thus limiting the maximum range of the radar. This is mitigated by adjusting the pulse length and the antenna rotation speed.. The advantages of the PSR and SSR are often combined by co-locating them.
