Pilots of fixed wing transport aircraft rarely encounter passenger-carrying hot air balloons as a potential collision risk, leaving some vulnerable to complacency about this threat. Typically (though not exclusively) these encounters happen just before or soon after dawn, during the fixed-wing airplane's descent to the destination aerodrome â€” often at the conclusion of long-haul, night cruise flight segments. Hot air balloons also have been encountered in other scenarios. The purpose of this article is to increase flight crews' awareness of hot air balloons with the benefit of current guidance developed by the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority, which updated the guidance in the context of increased issuance of air operator's certificates to balloon operators that meet public transport standards for commercial ballooning.
