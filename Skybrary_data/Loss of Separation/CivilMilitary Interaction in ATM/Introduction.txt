Since the Chicago Convention explicitly states that it does not apply to state aircraft (a categorization which includes aircraft used in military, police and customs services) the very presence of military aircraft means that there is a high chance that different (from ICAO) rules and procedures may be followed by such aircraft. The differences in the procedures applied can vary between minor variation in a separation minimum (e.g. 2000ft separation within RVSM airspace) and situations where an apparent total lack of rules (e.g. military intruder interception) might require the best judgement of the controller to be used to protect civil aircraft in the vicinity.
