The advice given in this section is derived from experience and common sense and is not expected to replace or supersede local instructions. Resist the urge to accommodate requests (made either by pilots or controllers from adjacent sectors).. Unless there is a safety issue, avoid harassing adjacent sectors with requests to promptly respond to your proposal.. Take into account all aircraft in the immediate vicinity, regardless of colour representation by the automated system. Ideally each track should be checked and confirmed not to be a potential safety threat.. Extra attention should be given on controlled aircraft outside own area of responsibility. In such situations, most or all of the other aircraft in the vicinity of the controlled aircraft are represented as “unconcerned”. Therefore, the risk of a Blind spot is significantly increased.. Make sure that aircraft labels do not overlap and do not lead to confusion (e.g. due to crossing leader lines).. Use supporting tools. Most ATS systems provide some sort of assistance for short-term conflict detection, e.g. a tactical controller tool (TCT) or a “what-if” function and a simple input of the clearance (e.g. a CFL) before issuing it would usually trigger an MTCD check..
