A program was initiated by ICAO in 1982 involving worldwide studies to assess the feasibility of a reduction of the Vertical Separation Minima (VSM) above FL290 from 2,000 feet to 1,000 feet. The principal benefits which the implementation of the reduced VSM were expected to provide were: A theoretical doubling of the airspace capacity, between FL290 and FL410; and. The opportunity for aircraft to operate at closer to the optimum flight levels with the resulting fuel economies.. The program relies on the carriage and serviceability of specified aircraft equipment and the existence of appropriate operating procedures to ensure that the risk of loss of separation is no greater than it would be outside RVSM airspace.
