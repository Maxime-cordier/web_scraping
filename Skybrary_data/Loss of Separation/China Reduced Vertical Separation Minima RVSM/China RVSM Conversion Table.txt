A typical China RVSM Conversion Table is as depicted in the illustration. In this example, the dark blue lines are for eastbound traffic and the light blue for westbound. As an operational example, a westbound aircraft might be cleared by ATC to climb to and maintain (FL) 11600 metres. Referring to the table, 11600 metres converts to 38100 feet. The pilot would set FL381 in the aircraft altitude select panel and climb as cleared. Upon reaching FL381, if required for the region of flight, the pilot would report level at 11600 metres. In the same manor, an eastbound aircraft might be cleared to descend to (FL) 9800 metres. Using the Conversion Table, the pilot would extract FL321, set that flight level in the aircraft altitude select panel and descend calling level at the cleared metric flight level if required.
