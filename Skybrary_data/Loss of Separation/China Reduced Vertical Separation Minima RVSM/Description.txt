In November 2007, China implemented RVSM, between 8,900m (FL291)and 12,500m (FL411) inclusive, in the Shenyang, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Kunming, Wuhan, Lanzhou and Urumqi FIRs and Sector AR01 (island airspace) of the Sanya CTA. The China RVSM airspace is exclusive RVSM airspace and aircraft that are not RVSM compliant may not operate within it unless specific waivers (for example, State aircraft) have been granted. A Flight Level Allocation Scheme (FLAS) is the foundation for the Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) program. In most areas of the world, implementing States have used a consistent FLAS based upon flight levels expressed in the unit of feet. However, China, in developing its FLAS, has taken a different approach.
