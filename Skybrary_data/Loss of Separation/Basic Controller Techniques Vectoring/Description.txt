The goal of vectoring is to have the aircraft achieve and maintain the desired track. When an aircraft is given its initial vector diverting it from a previously assigned route, the pilot must be informed about: the reason for the deviation (e.g. due to traffic, for sequencing, etc.). the expected duration (e.g. for the next 5 minutes). General restrictions: Aircraft must not be vectored closer than a half of the separation minimum (i.e. closer than 2.5 NM if the separation minimum is 5 NM) from the limit of the airspace which the controller is responsible for, unless otherwise specified in local arrangements.. Controlled flights are not to be vectored into uncontrolled airspace, except in the case of emergency or in order to circumnavigate adverse weather (in which case the pilot should be informed), or at the specific request of the pilot.. When vectoring or giving a direct route to an IFR flight takes the aircraft off an ATS route, the clearance should take into account the prescribed obstacle clearance.. After vectoring, the controller must instruct the pilot to resume own navigation, giving them the aircraftâ€™s position if necessary. The 1 in 60 rule could be used for quick calculation of the necessary heading change.
