Forgetting that an aircraft is being vectored. This has a negative impact on flight efficiency but may also "surprise" the next ATS sector or unit, especially if the airway makes a sharp turn at the transfer of control point and the aircraft does not.. Miscalculation of wind impact (level flight). If a controller tries to sequence an aircraft after another one by vectoring but instructs it to turn so that the tailwind component increses, then the manoeuvre may have no effect (the tailwind will increase the aircraft's speed effectively reducing the expected benefit from vectoring).. Miscalculation of wind impact (climbing and descending aircraft). Wind may be different at different levels. Even if the direction is somewhat the same, the windspeed can vary significantly. Consequently the headwind/tailwind/crosswind component will also vary and this may impact the desired result. For example, the drifting angle at different levels may be different if the windspeed (and therefore the crosswind component) increases with height. This may lead to parralel tracks becoming converging. A common mitigation for this is to assign a parallel or slightly diverging heading to the aircraft being vectored.. Miscalculation of aircraft performance (climbing and descending aircraft). Generally, climbing aircraft increase their groundspeed and descending aircraft reduce it. The speed at cruising level can be twice that at e.g. FL 150. If this is not taken into account properly, the result may be loss of separation..
