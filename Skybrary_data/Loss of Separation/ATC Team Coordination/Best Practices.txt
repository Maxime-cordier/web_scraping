The best practices for inter-sector coordinations are mostly the same as those used between different ATC units (described in detail in the dedicated article). In summary: Identification of situations that are subject to coordination is critical.. A coordination done twice is usually better than no coordination. Verify instead of assuming.. Coordination is all about two controllers agreeing to and being comfortable with the same plan.. Coordinations should be timely.. A simpler plan is less ambiguous, easier to coordinate, implement and monitor and generally safer.. Electronic coordinations should be used whenever possible.. Controllers should try to stick to the standard procedures and reduce coordinations, except if: safety concerns arise. the workload is low. the coordination would reduce traffic complexity.. safety concerns arise.. the workload is low.. the coordination would reduce traffic complexity.. Rejection should only be used with good reason.. A "block" coordination applicable for a defined period of time and portion of the air traffic may sometimes be used to significantly reduce the workload.. In addition to the above, some specific aspects of inter-sector coordination are: Refrain from making non-operational conversations or calls.. Use the enhanced coordinations tools. They often provide richer options compared to those for external coordinations.. Use system support to draw attention. Marking an aircraft before initiating a coordination may help the other party distinguish the aircraft within the bunch by its e.g. blinking label or special colour.. Fixing aircraft trajectories in line with the clearances given allows the ATS system to correctly represent the aircraft to the neighbouring sectors..
