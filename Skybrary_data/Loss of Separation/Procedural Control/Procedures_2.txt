of the aircraft are adjusted in such a way that a lower separation minimum is applicable.. one of the aircraft will need to change the level so that vertical separation is applied, or. one of the aircraft makes an orbit for delay, so that the applicable time minimum is achieved, or. the speeds of the aircraft are adjusted in such a way that a lower separation minimum is applicable.. Note: the list of possible controller actions is not exclusive. Two aircraft are maintaining different levels but the lower one requests to climb to a level above the upper one. The controller compares the position estimates and determines the appropriate horizontal sepration to be used for the period of time when vertical separation would not exist. The climbing aircraft will also be required to report passing or reaching the level that is 1000 ft above the other one..
