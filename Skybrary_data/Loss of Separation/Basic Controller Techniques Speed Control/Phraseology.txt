Report speed (in case the current speed cannot be obtained by other means, e.g. Mode S information). Maintain/increase/reduce [speed] [or greater/or less] [reason] [condition]. Examples: Maintain 300 knots or greater Maintain Mach .83 or less due converging traffic until [point name] Reduce speed 260 knots or less for sequencing Increase speed Mach .82 or greater for the next 10 minutes.. Maintain 300 knots or greater. Maintain Mach .83 or less due converging traffic until [point name]. Reduce speed 260 knots or less for sequencing. Increase speed Mach .82 or greater for the next 10 minutes.. Resume normal speed (cancels a previously imposed speed restriction). No ATC speed restrictions (cancels a previously imposed speed restriction). On speed conversion [speed]. This instruction is sometimes used for climbing or descending aircraft when the speed control includes the moment of swithcing between IAS and Mach number. Note: while this instruction is used in a number of countries, it is not part of the ICAO standard phraseology..
