To counter the weakened ability of the eye to maintain a distant focus, good practices are to: Focus frequently on distant visible objects, e.g. on outlines of terrain at or near the horizon; this helps to stimulate the eyes to establish long-distance focal points;. Stimulate the eyes by focusing at own aircraft wing tips;. Consider flying above a haze/smoke layer if possible;. It may be preferable when scanning the sky for other aircraft to use peripheral vision to detect movement. Peripheral vision responds better in terms of detection of weak stimuli associated with slight movement than the central vision..
