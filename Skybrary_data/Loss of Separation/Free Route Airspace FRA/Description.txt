Free route airspace (FRA) is a concept of providing air traffic services in which an operator can choose their route subject to only a few limitations (e.g. fixed entry and exit points and the need to avoid danger areas, TRAs or TSAs) as opposed to the situation where standard airways should be used. In most cases the straight line between an entry point and an exit point will be chosen. If for some reason this is not appropriate (e.g. a danger area needs to be avoided) additional turning points can be specified. These can be navigational aids, published navigational points or points with specified coordinates. The following diagram gives an overview of the main FRA rules: In the example FIR depicted, INTRO and ENTER are entry points, ALTAV and EXITO are exit points, SNA is a VOR and REKRA is an RNAV point. When FRA is implemented, the green routes would be accepted and the red routes would be rejected by the ATC flight plan processing system.. The reasons for rejection include the crossing of a danger area (INTRO-ALTAV) and the requested route not remaining within the FRA (ENTER-ALTAV). The approved routes can be either direct from an entry to an exit point (e.g. ENTER-EXITO) or with intermediate points (navigational aids (SNA), published points (REKRA) or randomly selected points (42°39’26” N, 23°22’42” E)).
