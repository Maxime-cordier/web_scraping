The following measures can be used to mitigate the safety issues and to cope with the challenges posed by FRA implementation. The list is not to be considered exclusive. Large scale deployment of FRA would increase the overall efficiency benefits.. Step-by-step deployment of FRA would reduce the safety risks. Airspace-specific safety risks could be detected more easily and addressed in a timely fashion.. Appropriate changes to the airspace design and updates of the letters of agreement (entry and exit points, sectors, restricted areas, ATS delegation, etc.). Dedicated training to help controllers familiarise themselves with the new operational issues arising from FRA (e.g. new conflicts, unfamiliar traffic flows, etc.). As far as reasonably practicable, both the transferring and accepting controllers should make their best effort to ensure that the aircraft exiting or entering their area of responsibility are not in immediate conflict with other aircraft and be ready to initiate timely coordinated measures for solving the conflict.. Controllers should coordinate flights flying along sector boundaries with the adjacent sector or unit.. Restricted areas (TSAs, TRAs, danger areas, etc.) should have buffers so that aircraft can fly safely close to their borders. If a restricted area does not include a buffer airspace, controllers shall ensure that aircraft fly at a safe distance from the area boundaries.. Re-evaluation and optimisation of existing sector definitions might be necessary; flexible ATC sector configuration management might be applied to manage controller workload in line with changes in the traffic flow and its complexity. Development of controller support tools (e.g. Tactical Controller Tool (TCT)) would reduce ATCO workload..
