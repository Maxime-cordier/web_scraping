As far as practicable, the rules and procedures of ICAO and the provisions of EU regulations are to be used as a basis and national authorities may establish additional requirements. Therefore, aircrews need to consult the relevant documents (e.g. AIP, EUROAT chapters) of the States they intend to over-fly to ensure appropriate regulatory compliance. The following requirements are defined in the EUROAT document: General. Aircraft to be used as OAT need to be in the appropriate technical condition, and the crews must be qualified, medically fit and proficient in English.. Diplomatic clearance. State aircraft require a valid diplomatic clearance to cross national borders.. Flight Plan. A flight plan using the ICAO format must be filed before such a flight.. ACAS. If equipped with ACAS/TCAS, single aircraft must operate in the TA/RA mode. In a standard military formation, this must only be done by the lead aircraft.. Altimeter settings. Standard atmospheric pressure (1013.2 hPa) is to be used at or above the transition level (or if climbing above the transition altitude). QNH or QFE are to be used at or below the transition altitude (or when descending below the transition level).. Supersonic flights. These can only be conducted if permitted by the appropriate national authority upon prior individual request..
