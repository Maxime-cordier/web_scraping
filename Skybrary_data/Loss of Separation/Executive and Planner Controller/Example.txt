This section contains an example scenario explaining workload distribution between EXE and PLN. Note that there are multiple solutions to the scenario. On receiving an estimate about IVB995, the PLN examines the label and the flight path. The current level is FL 320 and the requested level is FL 400. The planned trajectory within the sector is ENTRY-FIREX. Then, the PLN checks whether FL 400 is achievable at the exit point. PLN notices that ABC123 is already maintaining FL400 and is also exiting via FIREX. Therefore, PLN sets the exit flight level of IVB995 to FL 380. However, PLN also notices that there is a crossing conflict with DJK0905 at FL 360. Therefore, PLN advises EXE to initially clear IVB995 to FL 340. Several minutes later, IVB995 checks in on the frequency, EXE informs the crew that they are identified and asks the pilot to confirm the requested cruising level. The respond is FL 400 (as expected) and EXE clears the flight to climb to FL 340 (so that there is procedural separation with DJK0905). A few minutes later EXE notices that the rate of climb is high enough and discusses with PLN the option to reclear the flight to FL 380. Both controllers find this feasible so EXE asks the pilot if they are able to continue climb at this rate. The pilot confirms and EXE clears the action. Meanwhile EXE notices that IVB995 and DJK0905 are diverging after FIREX (the yellow and blue lines) and asks PLN to coordinate a direct routing for IVB995 with the next sector so that the requested level is achieved earlier. The planner contacts the next sector with this request and obtains an approval. EXE waits until IVB995 has climbed above DJK0905 and clears it to fly on a direct route (red line). Then, when IVB995 and ABC123 are safely separated, EXE clears IVB995 to climb to FL 400.
