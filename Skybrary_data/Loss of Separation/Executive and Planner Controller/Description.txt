Air traffic controllers often work in teams of two with one person designated as the executive controller (EXE) and the other one as the planner controller (PLN). While being responsible for the provision of ATS in the same volume of airspace, they are performing different (but interconnected) tasks and ultimately, working as a team. This arrangement is somewhat similar to flight crews, however while the pilot in command makes the final decision and bears the responsibility for it, controllers are of equal authority (unless otherwise stated in the local procedures). The EXE's main responsibilities are air traffic management within the sector (area of responsibility, AoR) and performing the tactical tasks (which is why they are sometimes called "tactical controller"). The main tool of the EXE is the microphone (or equivalent means of communication) which is used to communicate with aircraft, pass instructions and clearances to provide separation and deliver useful information. The PLN's main responsibility is to coordinate with the neighbouring sectors and units about the conditions under which aircraft will enter or exit the AoR. The overall aim is to ensure that there are no surprises to the EXE and that the traffic enters and leaves the sector in a well organized way. The main tool of the PLN is the telephone (or equivalent means of communication).
