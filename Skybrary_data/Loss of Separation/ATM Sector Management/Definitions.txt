Declared capacity. A measure of the ability of the ATC system or any of its subsystems or operating positions to provide service to aircraft during normal activities. It is expressed as the number of aircraft entering a specified portion of airspace in a given period of time, taking due account of weather, ATC unit configuration, staff and equipment available, and any other factors that may affect the workload of the controller responsible for the airspace. Note: Declared capacities are given as number of aircraft that can be serviced per hour. The exact value is determined using a variety of methods (e.g. simulation, expert assessment, etc.). The calculation takes into account airspace size and structure, expected traffic flow, the equipment used etc. Declared capacities are to be periodically reviewed by the ANSPs. Over-delivery. An occurrence when the declared rate of the ATFM regulation is exceeded by the actual number of aircraft that enter a regulated sector during a particular period. Overload. An occurrence when an air traffic controller reports that he/she has had to handle more traffic than they consider it was safe to do so. An overload could be caused by an inadequate flow management strategy or by over-deliveries or by both.
