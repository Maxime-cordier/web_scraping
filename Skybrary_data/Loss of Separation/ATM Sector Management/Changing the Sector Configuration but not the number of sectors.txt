Sometimes traffic flows shift in such a way that a different configuration with the same number of sectors is considered preferable than opening a new sector or merging existing sectors. For instance, a configuration of one upper and two lower sectors (which managed a high number of departing and arriving traffic) may need to be replaced by three vertically split sectors (lower, middle and upper) in order to cope with the expected increase of overflying aircraft. As in the other cases, the decision for changing the sector configuration is made by the supervisor based on the traffic demand. The procedures to be followed are described in the ATSU manual of operations and typically include: Informing the concerned sectors/units about the new frequencies;. Coordination between the sectors as necessary (e.g. for conflicting aircraft that are now in a different sector);. Performing handover/takeover between the sectors as necessary;. Risks, associated with changing the sector configuration while preserving the number of sectors: At least some of the controllers will face a (completely) different situation (in terms of airspace, aircraft and procedures);. Increased inter-sector coordination is to be expected in the transition period (aircraft within the sector group may have to change frequency);. Some of the controllers will inevitably control (for a few minutes) aircraft that are well outside the boundaries of their new sector while at the same time their situational awareness will be reduced (due to e.g. colour representation of the aircraft that are entering the airspace that is now controlled by a different sector)..
