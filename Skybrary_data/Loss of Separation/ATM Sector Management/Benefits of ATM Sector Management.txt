Flexibility – different sectors configurations can be used depending on expected traffic flow (e.g. the sector can be divided horizontally or vertically, split into three or more sectors, etc.). Optimal use of personnel – sectors can be merged after traffic levels have decreased. This gives the management options to handle the traffic with less controllers as opposed to the strategy where all possible sectors are manned at all times regardless of traffic levels.. Increase of overall efficiency – when looking at air traffic control from a global perspective, the widespread use of ATM sector management helps to better handle the “bottlenecks” of air traffic flow, thus reducing delays, costs and emissions.. Safe ATS provision – appropriate sector configuration ensures optimal controller workload preventing overload and distraction caused by too low traffic levels..
