The closing/merging of sectors is based on local particularities and should be described in the Manual of Operations of the ATSU. While there are no strict rules for, this some typical criteria are: Expected traffic is and is expected to remain below a specified threshold, e.g. 90% of the merged sector capacity;. The number of expected aircraft on the frequency at the same time is and is expected to remain less than a specified threshold;. Traffic complexity, e.g. few aircraft departing from/ arriving to nearby aerodromes;. Weather improvement;. A combination of the above.. The procedures to be followed in case a new sector is open should be described in detail in the Manual of Operations of the ATSU. The typical steps are as follows: The supervisor makes a decision for closing/merging sectors when traffic levels are low and most situations (conflicts) have been resolved;. The controllers from the sector being closed inform the concerned sectors/units;. The controllers from the united sector perform a takeover/handover procedure and assume control of all aircraft within their area of responsibility;. The frequency of the closed sector is usually monitored for a period of time (e.g. at least 30 minutes).. Risks, associated with the closing/merging of sectors: Premature closing/merging, resulting in the overload of the united sector; this can be avoided if correct timing for the procedure is used;. Underestimation of traffic, leading to overload shortly after the sectors have been merged; this risk can be mitigated with adequate interpretation of traffic forecasts..
