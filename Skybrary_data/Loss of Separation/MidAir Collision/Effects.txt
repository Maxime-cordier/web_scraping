Possible consequences of a MAC are temporary or permanent Loss of Control as a result of damage, avoidance manoeuvre, or mis-handling, potentially resulting in collision with terrain, or an emergency landing as a result of damage to the aircraft and/or injuries to crew and passengers. It is commonly assumed that any MAC would cause loss of both aircraft and all people on board. In fact, accident and serious incident reports show that there have been a few non-fatal MAC accidents. However, in most cases, total loss is the result. A crash following MAC may also cause fatalities among people on the ground.
