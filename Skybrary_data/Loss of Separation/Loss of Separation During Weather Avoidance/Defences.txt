As a controller: Inform pilots as soon as practicable about any reports of adverse weather ahead, especially about those relating to turbulence and in-flight icing.. In the case of turbulence avoid, insofar as is possible, the use of opposite flight levels to solve crossing conflicts. Vectoring or 2000ft separation are usually more appropriate better options.. Be prepared to ask pilots about the likelihood of their taking weather avoiding action or making a weather-predicated change of track within the next few, say 3-5, minutes in order to help build an adequate short-term plan.. Assign safe (non-conflicting) flight levels to climbing and descending aircraft.. Issue instructions for traffic to cross other traffic at conflicting levels only after ensuring that the crossing will be safe using rates, locked headings or equivalent conditions.. If unsure whether an intended clearance in relation to adverse weather will be acceptable, ask pilots that question before issuing it.. Assign required minimum or maximum rates of climb/descent to make sure climbing/descending aircraft remain separated, even in case of a sharp unexpected turn.. Remember that assigning different flight levels to aircraft on converging flight paths is generally preferable to speed control or vectoring. Be aware that the number of aircraft on converging flight paths may increase if exit points become unavailable.. Advise adjacent sectors or units for aircraft that are unable to maintain RVSM due to turbulence.. Think ahead - work out the essentials of alternative plans for separating flights in adverse weather conditions; take account of things like an aircraft being be too heavy to climb higher and the natural reluctance of pilots to accept significantly lower cruise levels due to concerns about increased fuel burn..
