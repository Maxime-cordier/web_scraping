Probe generally shares the same human-machine interface with the clearance tools (trajectory modification, level allocation, etc.). The controller is presented with a choice - either enter the modification or trigger a what-if check. This may be done e.g. by using different mouse buttons (left=execute, right=probe) or by adding a special button to all input features (if the button is pressed, then use Probe, if not - proceed with the change) or some other solution. If Probe is chosen, the software creates a new, temporary trajectory and sends it to the MTCD subsystem. The MTCD processes the proposed change and provides information about the potential conflicts (or lack thereof) that would happen should the clearance be issued. The controller may then choose to proceed with the clearance or to go for an alternate plan. Probe-like features have been available in the ATS systems for some time. For example, inputting a cleared level (without issuing a clearance) would send the controller input to the MTCD subsystem. If a conflict is found, the controller may revert to the previous value. Therefore, this feature may be considered as a what-if predecessor. The difference between those and the "real" Probe function is that the latter presents the results of the two situations (actual and hypothetical) at the same time to allow comparison. Also, undoing the change when using Probe could take considerably less time in case of route modification.
