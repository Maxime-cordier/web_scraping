Probe shares any MTCD-related issues. If the latter often shows false alarms the controllers may refrain from using it as they would not want to put extra effort and get unreliable results.. Probe is a fairly complex calculation and therefore may require a few seconds to complete. This may be too long for the controllers to wait as they are usually quickly switching between tasks.. Probe is subject to uncertainty due to the clearance not being issued yet (unlike e.g. MTCD, TCT, etc. which use the current flight parameters). Therefore, it is not suitable for situations where a mile or two make the difference between a safe situation and loss of separation.. Depending on local implementation, Probe may only be applicable to vertical clearance and not be available for horizontal manoeuvres.. Double controller input is required (one for Probe activation and another for the confirming the modification).. HMI output may not always be easy to interpret, e.g. if there are several conflicts in the original trajectory and several other on the one being tested, the screen may become too cluttered..
