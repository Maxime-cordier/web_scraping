Loss of separation is not a hazard on its own in many cases. However, if the situation is not corrected promptly (by restoring the applicable minima), an incident may quickly develop into an accident, e.g.: Loss of separation from other aircraft may result in collision;. Injury, especially to unsecured cabin crew or passengers, may result from violent manoeuvres to avoid collision with other aircraft;. Injury to aircraft occupants may also result from a wake vortex turbulence encounter.. Additionally, a loss of separation may cause high levels of stress for the pilots and controllers involved, and may lead to reduced performance (and possibly, other incidents).
