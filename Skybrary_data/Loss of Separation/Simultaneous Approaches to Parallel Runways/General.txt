Pilots will be advised that simultaneous dependent approaches, simultaneous approaches, or simultaneous close parallel PRM approaches are in use. This information may be provided through the ATIS. Parallel approach operations require heightened pilot situational awareness. A thorough review of the Approach Chart should be conducted with emphasis on the following approach information: name and number of the approach. location and proximity of the assigned runway relative to adjacent parallel runway(s). localizer frequency. inbound course. glide slope intercept altitude. glideslope check altitude. decision height. missed approach procedure. special notes or procedures. The close proximity of aircraft conducting approaches to adjacent runways demands strict and timely compliance with ATC assigned speeds, altitudes and headings. Precise final approach course tracking is critical to maintaining required separation. Pilots should notify ATC immediately in the event of loss or degradation of aircraft or navigation systems. Strict radio discipline is mandatory during simultaneous parallel approach operations. Lengthy or unnecessary radio transmissions must be avoided. Full and proper call signs should be used to prevent the inadvertent execution of clearances intended for another aircraft or confusion due to similar sounding call signs. Pilots must be alert to unusually long periods of silence or any unusual background sounds in their radio receiver as a stuck microphone could block the issuance of ATC instructions. Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) provide an additional element of safety to parallel approach operations. Pilots should follow recommended TCAS operating procedures in the event of a Resolution Advisory (RA).
