Lateral separation is achieved by various means, which include the following: By position reports which positively indicate the aircraft are over different geographic locations (see Fig. 1).. By requiring aircraft to fly on specified tracks which are separated by a minimum angle. Both aircraft must be established on radials or tracks which diverge by a specified amount depending on the type of navigation aid in use, and at least one aircraft must be at a distance of 15 NM or more from the facility (see Fig. 2)..
