To avoid collisions you must scan effectively from the moment the aircraft moves until it comes to a stop at the end of the flight. Collision threats are present on the ground, at low altitudes in the vicinity of aerodromes, and at cruising levels. Before take-off, check the runway visually to ensure that there are no aircraft or other objects in the take-off area. Check the approach and circuit to be sure of the position of other aircraft. Assess the traffic situation from radio reports. After take-off, continue to scan to ensure that there will be no obstacles to your safe departure. During the climb and descent beware of the blind spot under the nose â€“ manoeuvre the aircraft so that you can check. Especially during climb or descent, listen to radio exchanges between air traffic and other aircraft and form a mental image of the traffic situation and positions of aircraft on opposing and intersecting headings, anticipating further developments. Scan with particular care in the area of airway (route) intersections and when near a radio beacon or VRP. You should remain constantly alert to all traffic within your normal field of vision, as well as periodically scanning the entire visual field outside the aircraft to ensure detection of conflicting traffic. Remember that the performance capabilities of many aircraft, in both speed and rates of climb/descent, result in high closure rates, limiting the time available for detection, decision, and evasive action.
