Required Navigation Performance (RNP) is a family of navigation specifications under Performance Based Navigation (PBN) which permit the operation of aircraft along a precise flight path with a high level of accuracy and the ability to determine aircraft position with both accuracy and integrity. RNP offers safety benefits by means of its precision and accuracy and it reduces the cost of operational inefficiencies such as multiple step-down non-precision and circling approaches.
