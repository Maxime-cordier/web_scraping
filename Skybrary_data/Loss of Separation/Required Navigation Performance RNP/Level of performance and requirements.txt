RNP refers to the level of performance required for a specific procedure or a specific airspace block. An RNP of 0.3 means the aircraft navigation system must be able to calculate its position to within a circle with a radius of 3 tenths of a NM. The aircraft is required to have both aircraft and operational approval for RNP and the operator must know the level of monitoring provided. FMS equipment with GPS multi-sensor capability meeting TSO-C146 (SBAS/WAAS GPS) meets basic RNP requirements, when installed in an RNP-compliant aircraft installation. The FMS is a key component of an RNP compliant installation. The aircraft operator has to ensure that the aircraft meets the requirements for the specific approval being sought. An operational approval issued by one certification agency will typically be accepted by all, but the operator should ensure that the aircraft meets the requirements for the specific approval being sought or risk denial of access or violation.
