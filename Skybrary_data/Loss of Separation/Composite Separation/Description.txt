Composite separation is a combination of vertical separation and one of the other forms of horizontal separation (lateral or longitudinal). It allows using minima for each which may be lower than, but not less than half of, those used for each of the combined elements when applied individually. Composite separation is applied on the basis of regional air navigation agreements. It should be noted that composite separation is not meant to be used in surveillance environment, i.e. the combination of 500 ft vertical and 2.5 NM horizontal separation is out of scope. Composite separation is a means of improving airspace utilization and safety in route systems where conventional lateral separation is 90 NM or greater, due to the dispersion of some flights to other routes and altitudes. Composite separation may be considered where navigation is dependent on long-distance station-referenced aids and/or on self-contained systems and the frequency of flights crossing the axis of the track system is not significant. There are two types of composite separation provided for in ICAO Annex 11: composite lateral/vertical separation and composite longitudinal/vertical separation. An example of the former is shown on the pictures below. Prior to implementing composite separation, existing traffic flows are examined and aircraft navigation performance and expected dispersion are evaluated. After the introduction of composite separation, navigation performance is monitored so that the safety levels can be maintained. Composite separation requires that aircraft are properly established at the correct level and on the correct track on entry into the system. Aircraft position at the end points of the route structure where composite separation is applied needs to be accurately determined either by means of surveillance coverage or establishment of appropriate procedures.
