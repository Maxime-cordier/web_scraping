Useful for evaluating runway crosswind from reported wind, the crosswind is a function of the SINE of the angle between the runway and the wind direction. Therefore, crosswind can be estimated as follows: Angle between wind and runway (degrees): and runway (degrees) Crosswind component (% of wind strength): (% of wind strength) Sine of angle between wind direction and runway in degrees: wind direction and runway in degrees 0. 0. 0. 15. 25. 0.26. 30. 50. 0.5. 60 or more. 100. 0.87. The analogue clock face provides an easy way to remember this: 15 min = ¼ of an hour 15 degrees off = ¼ of the total wind across 30 min = ½ of an hour 30 degrees off = ½ of the total wind across 60 min = A full hour 60 degrees off = All of the wind across A similar process can be used to estimate wind effect on groundspeed Combining Max drift and Crosswind component: Flying at 420 kt groundspeed (7 nm/min) in the vicinity of a 60 kt wind (approx. 8½ degrees max drift) headwind from 30 degrees off track, the expected drift angle is just over 4 degrees. Flying at 420 kt airspeed in the vicinity of a 60 kt wind from 30 degrees off track, groundspeed will be approximately 360 kt (~6 nm/min) so max drift is 10 degrees and the expected drift angle will be 5 degrees.
