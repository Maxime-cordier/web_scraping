Since the ‘lift bonus’ attributable to ground effect is primarily a consequence of a reduction in induced drag, the way in which this changes with height above ground is effectively a proxy for changes in the lift coefficient. As can be seen from the diagram below, induced drag increases non-linearly as the distance from the ground increases and reaches its free air value at a height above ground equivalent to the wing span of a fixed wing aircraft or the rotor diameter of a helicopter. In both cases, this means a rapid drop off of ground effect as height above ground increases so that it is typically reduced to half of the adjacent-to-surface maximum at a height above ground which is equal to 10% of the wing span or rotor diameter, to a quarter of this at a height equivalent to 25% of the wing span or rotor diameter and to 10% of it by the time this height is equivalent to 90% of the wingspan or rotor diameter. The detail, but not the principle, of this height-based change in ground effect will be affected by the extent to which a wing is swept back. Taking the wing span of a fixed wing aircraft which is usually expressed in metres and converting it to feet as usually used for measuring height above the ground, it is worth noting that wing spans of most modern twin aisle aircraft are typically around 200 feet and those of most single aisle jets and large turboprops are typically in the range 100-120 feet. In the rotary wing case, typical rotor diameters of larger helicopters are typically in the range 55 to 60 feet. Ground effect is maximised in calm wind conditions and over a smooth and level hard surface. The effect over grass, an uneven surface and sometimes over water is likely to be much less. Not surprisingly, fixed wing aircraft with low wing fuselage attachment receive maximum ground effect.
