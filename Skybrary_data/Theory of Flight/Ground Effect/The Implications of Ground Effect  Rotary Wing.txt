For the rotary wing case, the main interest is the reduced power required to hover in ground effect (IGE) compared to in free air and the significance of the transition to or from free air in respect of control. The implication of IGE hover taxiing are that the increased outflow ‘distortion’ of the blade tip vortices may disturb adjacent unsecured ground equipment and/or cause the control surfaces of adjacent parked fixed wing aircraft to be forced against their stops with a potential for damage.
