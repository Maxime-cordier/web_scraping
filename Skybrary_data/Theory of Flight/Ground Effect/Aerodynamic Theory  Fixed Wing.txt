The increase in Liftlift created by Ground Effect comes primarily from a reduction in the amount of induced drag generated which improves the lift/drag ratio. In most circumstances, this increased lift is supplemented by a direct increase in the lift generated by the wing. The reduction in induced drag - so called because it is a function of the lift generated by the wing - occurs at the wing tip. When generated in proximity to the ground, the form of the wing tip vortex, which is always generated when an aerofoil moves through the air, because pressure beneath a wing is always higher than that above it, is modified. Instead of being circular, vortices in proximity to the ground become elliptical as the airflow is pushed outwards. This causes the effective aspect ratio of the wing to become greater than the geometric aspect ratio and reduces induced drag. Both lift (and airspeed for any given engine power setting) are increased. The direct effect on lift arises because a reduction in both upwash and downwash, as the air beneath a wing is compressed by ground proximity, creates a cushion effect. The effect is proportional to the chord of the wing but the extent to which it occurs is dependent upon the profile of the lower wing surface. If this lower surface is markedly convex, and the angle of attack is small, then the effect on lift eventually becomes negative. The overall effect of an improved lift/drag ratio when a wing is in ground effect is that a given amount of lift will be produced at a lower angle of attack than would be required in free air.
