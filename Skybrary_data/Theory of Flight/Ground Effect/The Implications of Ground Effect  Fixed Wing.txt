In normal flight operations, awareness of ground effect is important during the landing flare since it will exacerbate any tendency of an aircraft to float if either airspeed over the threshold or pitch control is not optimum. It is also taken into account in Fly-By-Wire system design in respect of the normal law transition from flight to ground status and vice versa. Also, it has been suggested that wake vortices descending into ground effect may not necessarily move laterally away from the runway upon reaching it as usually stated but can rebound. The existence of this effect has not been reliably substantiated - but neither has it been proved not to occur, so it is sometimes recommended that landing an aircraft significantly smaller than the preceding one in calm conditions should be accompanied by a degree of caution if landing beyond the previous aircraft touchdown position, even if wake vortex separation criteria are met. On the same basis, a landing or take off soon after a much larger aircraft has landed or rotated for take off on an intersecting runway may invite similar considerations. In the case where either rotation for take off or an attempt to conduct a go around after touch down is initiated at too low a speed for the aircraft configuration or weight, ground effect may lead to an initial airborne state which cannot be sustained as distance from runway surface increases and the lift premium from ground effect reduces. However, it may be possible in some of these cases to accelerate in ground effect to attain a speed compatible with flight in free air before pitching up and leaving ground effect.
