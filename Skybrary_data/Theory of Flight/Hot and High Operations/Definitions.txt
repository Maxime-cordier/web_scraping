Aerodrome Elevation – the elevation of the highest point of the landing area (ICAO). Pressure Altitude – aerodrome elevation corrected for ambient pressure. Simplistically, if the subscale of the aircraft altimeter is set to 1013.2 mb while the aircraft is on the ground, the altimeter will indicate Pressure Altitude. For example, ambient pressure greater than 1013.2 mb will result in a pressure altitude lower than aerodrome elevation and vice versa. Density Altitude – pressure altitude corrected for ambient temperature. Density altitude increases with an increase in ambient temperature.
