In all circumstances, performance calculations must take density altitude into consideration when calculating maximum takeoff weight, climb gradient, missed approach climb gradient and stopping distance. In addition, the following items should be considered to reduce the impact of “hot and high” operations: Plan operations around the coolest time of the day. Use the runway which provides for the best aircraft performance (usually, but not always, the longest runway). Limit payload or plan for an intermediate fuel stop at an en-route airfield.. Avoid tailwind operations and be mindful of maximum tyre speed. Allow for increased turn radius when manoeuvring. Ensure that engine at takeoff thrust/torque/power is meeting charted values. Where charts are provided, calculate an acceleration/time profile. Fly the aircraft in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines.
