The Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board (STSB) is an extra-parliamentary commission that investigates incidents in aviation, public transportation and high seas navigation in accordance with the country's Ordinance on the Safety Investigation of Transportation Incidents. The STSB's webpage states that the investigations' only goal is to increase safety in transportation, i.e. to prevent similar incidents in the future.
