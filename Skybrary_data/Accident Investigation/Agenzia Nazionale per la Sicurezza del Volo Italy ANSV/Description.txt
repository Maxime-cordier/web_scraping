"The ANSV is a public institution, with an autonomous decision making authority and it is settled as an independent body within the Civil Aviation System; therefore the objectivity of its dealings is assured as requested by the EC directive 94/56/CE. To guarantee such independent position ANSV has been put under the surveillance of Presidency of the Council of Ministers. It is the only Civil Aviation institution which is not under the surveillance of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport." "The ANSV has two main tasks: a) to conduct technical investigations for Civil Aviation aircraft accidents and incidents and to issue safety recommendations as appropriate (with the exclusion of accidents and incidents to State Aircraft); b) to conduct studies and surveys aimed at increasing flight safety."
