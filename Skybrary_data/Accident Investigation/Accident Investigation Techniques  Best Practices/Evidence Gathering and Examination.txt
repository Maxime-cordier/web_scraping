The stages of gathering evidence and their subsequent examination are very important for conducting an objective investigation. The following practices can prove very helpful: examination of evidence should start only after all of it has been gathered and categorized.. categorization of evidence is critical for the later stages of the investigation.. a systematic approach is essential to the success of the investigation. No conclusions should be drawn until all evidence has been examined and compared.. existing evidence should not be "tailored" to fit the conclusions and contradicting evidence should not be neglected just because it does not fit.. taking a lot of photos is essential for preserving the scene. This is especially true for the positions of gauges and switches whose position can be unintentionally changed when moved away from the scene.. creating a sketch of the scene takes little time but can be very useful, especially in the first days of the investigation when computer models are not yet ready..
