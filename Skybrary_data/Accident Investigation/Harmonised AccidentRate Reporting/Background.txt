Calculated accident and incident rates — the number of accidents or incidents during a given period divided by some measure of exposure, such as number of flights, over that period — is a basic tool used to measure and report safety performance in commercial aviation. But aviation regulators, trade organisations and other stakeholders can have varying definitions and accident classifications and often measure different but overlapping segments of the industry. In 2010, the European Commission, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) signed an agreement to develop a Global Safety Information Exchange (GSIE). The objective of the GSIE is to identify information that can be exchanged among the parties to enhance risk-reduction activities. At the time, ICAO said the GSIE was formed to help reduce the risk of accidents and improve the overall level of aviation safety worldwide. In 2011, GSIE began work on developing a harmonised accident rate. ICAO and IATA worked to align accident definitions, criteria and analysis methods used to calculate the harmonised rate, which is considered a key safety indicator for commercial aviation operations. The analysis includes accidents meeting the ICAO Annex 13 criteria for all typical commercial airline operations for scheduled and nonscheduled flights. The GSIE harmonised accident rate is measured in accidents per million sectors and includes scheduled and nonscheduled commercial operations, including ferry flights with a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of more than 5,700 kg. ICAO and IATA worked to develop a common taxonomy that would allow integration of accident data between the two organisations.
