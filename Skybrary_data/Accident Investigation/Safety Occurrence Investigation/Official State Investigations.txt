The international standards and procedures for safety occurrences reporting and investigation are outlined by ICAO in Annex 13 - Aircraft accident and incident investigation, Doc 9756 - Manual of Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation and Doc 9156 - Accident/Incident Reporting Manual. The responsibility for accident investigation is vested in the States. In order to discharge this responsibility in an effective and impartial manner many States have created specialised investigating bodies, often referred to as Air Accident Investigation Agencies. Such agencies must be wholly independent of the regulatory entities and aviation service providers so as to be able to examine the possibility of shortcomings in State Safety Regulations or State Safety Programmes. An example of such an agency which covers only aviation is the UK Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) and an example of a multimodal agency which includes aviation investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the USA. Many investigation agencies publish the final reports from their investigations online to promote access to hazard and risk-related information for the benefit of aviation safety worldwide, although if the state language is not English, many publish only in the state language with only a selection of reports - or none at all - also available in English translation. In Europe, full transparency is not mandated. Council Directive 94/56/EC requires only that the reports and the safety recommendations from the official investigations “… be communicated to the undertakings or national aviation authorities concerned and copies forwarded to the Commission” and that “Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the safety recommendations made by the investigating bodies or entities are duly taken into consideration, and, where appropriate, acted upon without prejudice to Community law”.
