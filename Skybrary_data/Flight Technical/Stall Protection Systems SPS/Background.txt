Stick pushers were originally developed to address crashes in aircraft susceptible to Deep Stall - generally T tail configuration aircraft in which the airflow over the elevators would be blocked by the wing in the event of a stall, thus making the aircraft unrecoverable. The pusher was incorporated to prevent this by pushing the nose down in the event that the aircraft reached the triggering angle of attack (AoA). The system is found in many corporate and commercial pattern aircraft
