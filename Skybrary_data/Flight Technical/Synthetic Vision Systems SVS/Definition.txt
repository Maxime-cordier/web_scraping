A synthetic vision system (SVS) is an aircraft installation that combines three-dimensional data into intuitive displays to provide improved situational awareness to flight crews. This improved situational awareness can be expected from SVS regardless of weather or time of day. In addition the system facilitates a reduced pilot workload during complex situations and operationally demanding phases of flight, e.g. on approach. SVS merges a high resolution display(s) with databases of terrain and obstacle data, aeronautical information, data feeds from other aircraft, and GPS to show pilots where they are and what is in their immediate surrounding area. SVS displays a model of the real world, presenting information to the flight crew in a way that is easy to understand and rapidly assimilated. The picture presented on the SVS display(s) replaces conventional sky and ground depiction to include a 3D representation of the external environment with details of terrain, obstacles, weather, the approach path, runway and aerodrome manoeuvring areas, and other traffic.
