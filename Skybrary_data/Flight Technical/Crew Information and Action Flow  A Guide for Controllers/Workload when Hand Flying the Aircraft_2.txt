verbal calls from the PF in order for the PM to select both the target value and the appropriate mode on the MCP. As the PM must physically use his hand to transmit a reply to any ATC instructions (i.e. to press the transmit switch) and also that, in order for the PM to hear the command from the PF correctly, the PF must wait until the PM has finished that transmission before verbally calling for the MCP selections, the MCP selections cannot therefore be commenced until such transmissions are completed, unlike the case of when the auto-pilot is engaged as described above. Below is an example of such sequence of events as required by SOPs: ATC instruct: “[Callsign] fly heading 150°, descend to altitude 4,000ft, QNH 1003”.. PM replies: “Fly heading 150°, descend to altitude 4,000ft, QNH 1003 [callsign]”.. PF calls: “Set heading 150°, select Heading Select. Set 4,000ft, select Level Change. Set QNH 1003”.. PM makes the MCP selections.. PF calls the FMA changes: “Idle, Heading, MCP Speed, altitude 5,900ft”.. PM replies: “Idle, Heading, MCP Speed, altitude 5,900ft checked”.. As illustrated above, this can therefore lead to a protracted, time consuming, chain of events when hand flying the aircraft. If a second radio transmission is received immediately after the first transmission – an instruction to change to another frequency, for example - or another (distracting) event occurs, it can be seen that this interrupts the flow of accomplishing the first action. This can therefore lead to the first action not being completed correctly or being forgotten, or the second transmission being mis-heard or not heard at all. In a busy traffic environment or in situations of high workload, flight crews are aware of such consequences of hand flying the aircraft and therefore will often make the best use of the ‘automatics’ in such situations.
