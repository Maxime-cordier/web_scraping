pilot interface allowing a limited number of waypoints to be entered and basic navigation information to be displayed. then (1980â€™s) referred to a similar system as above but with the additional capability of feeding inertial data to other aircraft systems such as the Flight Director and Autopilot. nowadays is predominantly used to describe an Inertial Platform, Inertial Reference System (IRS) and Inertial Reference Unit (IRU); and often used to describe all three of these units (as one system) typically installed on a single aircraft. INS Position refers to the latitude and longitude, and altitude, being fed from the IRU to other systems for reference, or as selected for display by a pilot on the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS). There are many other interchangeable terms in use such as: Inertial Guidance System, Air Data Inertial Reference Units and Systems, Inertial Measurement Unit etc, which can all be used when referring to INS. For the purposes of this Article, the definition of INS (what it is and what it does) that is likely to be most commonly used in the aviation community is as follows: Regardless of the technology used and the configuration of individual components, an Inertial Navigation System (INS) refers to the Inertial Platform, Reference System and Unit, and associated Inertial Outputs. Its purpose is to provide a continuous dead-reckoning position, altitude and speeds to the FMS, where this data is compared with inputs from other systems, such as ground-based and space-based navigation systems. This other navigation data can be used to update the INS. Data from the INS can also be used for input to flight control and guidance systems.
