As noted, effectively mitigating the risks of uncontained engine failures has a long history. Such failures can affect both the fan section and the turbine section; therefore, related engine and airframe designs must address both scenarios. Scientists and engineers pursue aircraft design features and turbine engine design features partly in response to information sources such as the results of engine-failure investigations (such as the 2019 example below). This pursuit of improved containment requires systems safety assessment, common cause analysis, particular risks analysis (e.g., engine “rotor burst”) and zonal analysis (an aspect of assessing effects of uncontained engine failures). Often-cited design features that help assure containment are the: Fan blade containment ring — This structural component provides a measure of protection in the event of fan blade separation;. Aircraft systems–routing segregation — This engineering practice addresses rotor burst and rapid depressurisation scenarios; and,. Fuel tank dry bays — Positioning empty sections within the most likely disk-shrapnel trajectories to reduce the risk of aeroplane fire ignition.. Design features also must minimise the hazards to the aeroplane in the event of a fire originating within the turbine engine that burns through the engine case.
