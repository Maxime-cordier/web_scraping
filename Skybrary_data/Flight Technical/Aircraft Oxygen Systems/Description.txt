This article describes the systems onboard commercial transport aircraft designed to supply supplemental oxygen to crew and passengers when required to sustain life. Oxygen systems are designed to store or to generate a supply of pure oxygen and to regulate, dilute as required and then distribute that oxygen to crew or passengers. Oxygen systems are installed in many military aircraft and in most commercial and business aircraft types. Depending upon the type and the role of the aircraft concerned, the oxygen system(s) may be used for normal operations, to provide supplemental oxygen for specific situations or for provision of emergency oxygen in the event of smoke, fire, fumes or loss of pressurisation.
