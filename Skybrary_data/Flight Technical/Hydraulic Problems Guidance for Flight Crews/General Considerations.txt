Manufacturers provide aircrew with comprehensive abnormal and emergency procedures for use in the event of a single or multiple failure. These procedures and the associated protocols will include the immediate actions required to secure the emergency, limitations and system losses resulting from the failure and, when applicable, the appropriate configuration and performance penalties to be utilized for continuing the flight and subsequent landing. The consequences of multiple failures are taken into consideration where applicable. As is the case with any unusual or emergency situation, pilots should complete the required memory items and then comply with the manufacturerâ€™s procedures, checklists and protocols and with any applicable company policies or directives. They should then consider the consequences of the failure and the associated impact on the continuation of the flight. Pilots should consider all available information, inclusive of but not limited to, aircraft controllability, range, operating altitudes, runway requirements and weather, and exercise their best judgement when making diversion decisions. In all cases, the primary pilot responsibility is to FLY THE AIRCRAFT.
