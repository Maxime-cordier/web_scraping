Plan for slower taxi speeds with gentler turning radii. If it is known that the tyres (and brakes) may be hot then the following precautions may be prudent in order to allow the components time to cool: Leave the gear down for a protracted period after take-off.. If at all possible, avoid committing to a landing very soon after take-off.. Follow the Flight Manual guidelines on cooling periods, for example after an emergency stop at whatever speed.. Ground controllers should consider where they would place an aircraft that requires a prolonged cooling period on the ground so as to minimise disruption to other traffic. Ensure adequate FOD control measures are in place and adhered to.
