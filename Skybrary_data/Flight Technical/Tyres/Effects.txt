There are 2 primary hazards associated with tyres: Deflation; the tyre deflates in a controlled manner with minimal direct consequence to other systems.. Explosive break-up; the tyre (and sometimes the wheel holding the tyre) deflates or breaks-up in an uncontrolled manner with a significant probability of secondary damage to other unrelated systems.. These hazards are associated with 4 distinct periods of aircraft operation: Ground operations e.g. taxiing. Take-off (up to gear retraction). Post take-off (gear stowed). Landing (to the end of the roll-out). The various combinations of hazard and flight period can have markedly different influences, but all can affect operations to some degree.
