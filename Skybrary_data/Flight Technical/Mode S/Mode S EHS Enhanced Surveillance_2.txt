the significant variations cased by a number of factors, such as turbulence, small but rapid aircraft vertical movements, etc.. TCAS downlinked resolution advisories.. In addition to the benefits for Mode S ELS, identified above, aircraft with Mode S EHS also provide the following operational benefits: Improved situation awareness. A clearer air situation picture, enhanced tracking and access to pertinent information direct from the aircraft enables the controller to benefit from quicker and more accurate recognition of airborne events.. Progressive reduction of R/T workload per flight. There is scope for R/T usage between controller and individual flight under service to be reduced following the progressive introduction of Mode S Enhanced Surveillance. It applies in particular to the current requirement for SSR code verification procedures and also where system enhancements and/or the display of downlink aircraft parameters obviate the need for certain voice communication exchanges, e.g. “ABC123, report heading”.. Safety enhancement. Access by controllers to aircraft intent DAPs, such as selected altitude enables cross-checking of climb/descent instructions and helps the early identification of potential level bust incidents..
