Crews must be aware of the AFM/FCOM information on fuel penalties and limitations for gear down ferry flights. The appropriate amount of fuel must be loaded before flight, the FMS fuel predictions should be ignored and range and endurance must be calculated on the basis of fuel flow indications. In the event of a system failure leading to an Abnormal Aircraft Configuration, crews must be aware of the increased fuel flow during the execution of the ECAM/EICAS/QRH procedures and take the reduced range and endurance into consideration when making their landing/diversion decisions. Manufacturers should make every effort to remind the flight crew of the increased fuel consumption by means of notes and cautions in the ECAM/EICAS/QRH procedures.
