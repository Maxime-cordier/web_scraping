The brakes themselves have also evolved over the years. Drum style brakes were still prevalent on many aircraft designed and built in the 1940s. Inefficient drum brakes have given way to disk brakes, initially with single and now more commonly with multiple rotors. The rotors are most commonly made from iron or steel but in the last 20 years, more and more aircraft have been equipped with carbon fibre brakes. There are multiple reasons for this evolution but the two most compelling ones are weight reduction and efficiency. Efficiency is particularly critical, for as aircraft get larger and their weight increases, the brakes must be capable of dissipating more energy. The kinetic energy of an aborted takeoff or a landing is largely converted to heat by the wheel brakes. Carbon brakes are still fully functional and retain the ability to absorb energy and slow the aircraft at and well beyond temperatures at which steel brakes have lost their efficiency and have started to “fade”.
