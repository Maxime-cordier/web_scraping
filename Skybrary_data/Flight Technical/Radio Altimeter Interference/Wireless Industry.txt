On 27 Oct. 2020, CTIA submitted to the FCC docket a response letter to the RTCA MSG Report. The following explanations of its positions and counter-arguments are from this filing: “As an initial matter, the [FCC] concluded in the C-Band Order that the 3.7 GHz Service technical rules and the spectral separation of at least 220 megahertz from radio altimeter operations “are sufficient to protect aeronautical services in the 4.2-4.4 GHz band.” The [FCC] “nonetheless agree[d] with [aviation interests] that further analysis is warranted on why there may even be a potential for some interference given that well-designed equipment should not ordinarily receive any significant interference (let alone harmful interference) given these circumstances.”. CTIA quoted an FCC finding about radar altimeters that “[w]e expect the aviation industry to take account of the RF environment that is evolving below the 3980 MHz band edge and take appropriate action, if necessary, to ensure protection of such devices.”. CTIA disputed the methodology of the RTCA report, including non-identification of radar altimeter models tested by Texas A&M University’s Aerospace Vehicle Systems Institute (AVSI), the researchers’ choice of least-likely aircraft landing scenarios, unwarranted margins for RF interference–tolerance thresholds, and inclusion of radar altimeter models that have not been certified for 40 years, are outdated, and possibly are out of service in current aircraft fleets.. CTIA questioned RTCA’s understanding of C-Band 5G–radar altimeter coexistence given that “RTCA is an aviation organization, it has no representation from the wireless industry, and it is not a cross-industry multi-stakeholder group.” Also, challenged was RTCA non-inclusion or minimal of wireless industry feedback to its draft version of the report..
