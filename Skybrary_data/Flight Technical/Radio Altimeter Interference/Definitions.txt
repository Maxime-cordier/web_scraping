Radio altimeter/radar altimeter — Airborne electronic devices capable of measuring the height of the aircraft above the terrain immediately below the aircraft. They operate in the 4.2–4.4 GHz band. Use of the radio altimeter is integral to terrain awareness and warning systems and to the landing of aircraft during CAT 2/CAT 3 approaches, for example.. 5G mobile telecommunications — According to CTIA – The Wirless Association, “5G is shorthand for the next generation of wireless. 5G will use a mix of low-, mid- and high-band spectrum — the invisible radio waves that mobile data travels on. … High-band spectrum will enhance high capacities by using what the industry calls mmWave technology — tiny radio wavelengths, measured in millimeters.. “5G … speeds will allow us to stream high-definition video in seconds and power innovations in fields like virtual reality. 5G will also reduce latency, or the delay that occurs when data is transmitted across distances, to nearly zero. This will allow autonomous vehicles to smoothly interact with each other and for advancements like remote surgery to be possible. And 5G networks will be able to handle 100 times the number of connected devices, enabling the Internet of Things and smart cities.”
