Aircraft design has featured bleed air systems for a number of decades. However, with the introduction of the B787, Boeing has incorporated a new no-bleed systems architecture that eliminates the traditional pneumatic system and bleed manifold. Most functions formerly powered by bleed air such as the air-conditioning packs and wing anti-ice systems are now electrically powered. According to Boeing, the no-bleed systems architecture offers operators a number of benefits, including: Improved fuel consumption due to a more efficient secondary power extraction, transfer, and usage.. Reduced maintenance costs due to elimination of the maintenance-intensive bleed system.. Improved reliability due to the use of modern power electronics and fewer components in the engine installation.. Expanded range and reduced fuel consumption due to lower overall weight..
