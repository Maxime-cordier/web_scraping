Good knowledge of the performance and characteristics of the aircraft, as well as comparison between the information in the logbook, gauges and the level in the tanks are necessary to avoid fuel starvation. These elements are an essential part of flight preparation. Good fuel management during the flight will then allow the right decision at the right time: to divert or continue the flight. Since most fuel starvation events can be attributed to pilot factors, the following fields offer greatest opportunities for improvement: Pilot training and procedures Emphasise the importance of the pilot’s responsibility for fuel management checks; Demonstration of fuel system management knowledge and skills as an essential requirement for routine flight checks; Standardisation of fuel selection and management systems within operators’ fleets; Consideration of ergonomic and procedural issues in aircraft fuel systems, when determining airworthiness standards..
