Manufacturers of most aftermarket coatings currently available typically make claims that their product(s) will contribute to all or some of: Increased paint life. Increased surface smoothness. Corrosion protection. Decreased adherence of dirt and other contaminants. Decreased drag and reduced fuel consumption. Application of an aftermarket aircraft coating usually involves a three step process: Surface cleaning. Polarisation (inducing a positive charge) of the surface. Application of the coating. Many coatings are composed of nanoparticles[1] which are small enough to fill even the tiniest of cracks and imperfections. Manufacturers claim that the extremely smooth surface which results from product application can reduce both contaminate adhesion and aerodynamic drag. British Airways has conducted a surface coating trial with one of their transatlantic route-dedicated Airbus A318 aircraft and report positive results.[2] As an alternative to aftermarket coatings, Lufthansa Technik AG and Airbus are experimenting with a paint application process that would emulate the drag reduction characteristics of shark skin[3]. Using specialized application, stamping and drying techniques, tiny riblets are formed in the surface of the paint. At high speed, the riblets reduce drag by reducing turbulence perpendicular to the airflow. Further research and development are required before large scale implementation of this process might be practical. However, existing research indicates that specialized paint application processes could result in a one percent fuel savings.
