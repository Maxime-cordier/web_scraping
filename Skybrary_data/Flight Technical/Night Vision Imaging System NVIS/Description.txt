Visual reference to the aviator’s outside world is essential for safe and effective flight. During the daylight hours and in visual meteorological conditions (VMC), the pilot relies heavily on the out-the-windshield view of the airspace and terrain for situational awareness. In addition, the pilot’s visual system is augmented by the avionics which provide communication, navigation, flight control, mission, and aircraft systems information” . During night flying, the pilot can improve the out-of-the-windshield view with the use of a night vision imaging system (NVIS). While NVISs have been developed with the aim of improving flight safety, their operation may also represent a flight safety hazard due to, e.g., equipment failure and compatibility, improper flight preparation, issues with regard to flight crew experience and recency, (lack of) regulatory oversight and inadequate standard operating procedures (SOPs).
