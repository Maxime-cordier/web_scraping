Greater emphasis is now being given to the prevention of ground collisions and runway incursions. Procedures are therefore being adopted with the philosophy that both pilots are to monitor the taxi route and avoid being ‘heads down’ in the cockpit whilst taxiing. Common procedures that will be seen during the ground phase of the flight will therefore be: The ‘Before Taxi/After Engine Start’ checklist being completed before commencing taxi;. The taxi route being confirmed between both pilots;. Crews that are unfamiliar with the airfield may take a relatively long period of time to check the cleared taxi route on the aerodrome charts before commencing taxi;. Turning points, holding points, runways and runway incursion hotspots being verbally called out.. In keeping with this philosophy it is therefore best practice for controllers to refrain from issuing any instructions when aircraft are approaching any such turning points or runways in order to avoid the pilots becoming distracted at those locations. Things to look out for. The taxi clearance, when it is given and the complexity of it. How the flight crew cross check the taxi clearance and navigate to their cleared point. The precautions the crew take when approaching turning points, holding points, runways and runway incursion hotspots.. The taxi clearance, when it is given and the complexity of it..
