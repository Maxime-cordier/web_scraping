The cost index entered into the FMS by the flight crew will have a dramatic effect on the FMS commanded climb, cruise and descent speeds. During fam flights controllers can observe such variance in speeds by asking the flight crew to demonstrate this. This can be accomplished by entering on the relevant FMS page the two extremes of the cost index value (i.e. zero and the maximum value) and then viewing the speed consequently given on the FMS ‘Climb’, ‘Cruise’ and ‘Descent’ pages.
