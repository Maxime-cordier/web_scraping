A simpler form of automation is based on manual input from the Flight Crew, which is inputted through the MCP/FCU. MCP/FCU manipulation is used for tactical operations i.e. actions undertaken to achieve a specific short term objective. The mode selector controls are used to choose roll and pitch modes for the autopilots and auto-throttles. Basic inputs such as heading, speed, vertical speed, flight level/altitude can be input. Once these modes have been selected as active the aircraft will then adjust the pitch attitude, heading and thrust to achieve the selected parameters. Use of these modes does not require a vertical or lateral profile to be input into the FMS.
