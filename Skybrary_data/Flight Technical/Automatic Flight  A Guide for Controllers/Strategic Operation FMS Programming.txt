The higher level of automation is based on the FMS which allows strategic input i.e. operations to achieve a longer term goal. The FMS is the aircraft’s ‘central brain’ and is interlinked with an array of onboard systems including all navigation systems, the autopilot and the auto-throttle. It is typically able to control all phases of flight (takeoff, en route, approach and landing) with full engine thrust management. The FMS also provides fuel and time management. The FMS is able to determine the most accurate navigation solution for both vertical and lateral navigation (including holding). It can calculate the most efficient speed, level etc. for the vertical profile based on the route to be flown, winds, temperature, aircraft weight, atmospheric pressure and cost index (cost vs. speed ratio). Therefore following the FMS calculated profile will normally be the most precise and efficient navigation solution. The lateral profile tends to be restricted by the flight plan routing and approach/departure procedures. A global AIRAC database of all navigation data is periodically uploaded into the FMS by the maintenance crew and then accessed by the Flight Crew. The FMS database should adhere to the standard AIRAC cycle, and the ‘valid from’ and expiry date should be checked by the Flight Crew before flight. The aircraft will automatically fly a selected profile provided that VNAV and LNAV navigational modes have been selected. These profiles can be modified by the Flight Crew if needed.
