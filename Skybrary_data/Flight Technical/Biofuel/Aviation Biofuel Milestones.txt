Prior to in-flight use, HEFA fuels were exhaustively tested under both laboratory and ground engine run conditions. Blends containing conventional jet fuel and up to 50% biofuel were compared against unblended petroleum based fuel with no significant performance variances observed. Inflight testing milestones include: February 2008 - Virgin Atlantic 747-400 flight with one engine burning a 20% biodiesel blend. December 2008 - Air New Zealand 747-400 flight with a 50/50 blend of Jatropha based biofuel and convential fuel. January 2009 - Continental Airlines operates the first flight with an algae derived biofuel. January 2009 - Japan Airlines 747-300 flight with a 50/50 blend of jet fuel and Camelina/Jatropha/Algae based HEFA fuel. June 2011 - Boeing Company 747-800 freighter transAtlantic flight with all engines burning a 15% HEFA fuel blend. August 2011 - Aeromexico 777-200 transAtlantic flight with revenue passengers using a 30% Jatropha based blend. Since 2011, the use of blended biofuel in commercial operations has become increasingly more common although price and availability have, thus far, limited its widespread utilization.
