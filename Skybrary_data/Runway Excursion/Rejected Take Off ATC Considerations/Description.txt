The take-off phase of each flight is critical as the error-tolerance margin becomes very slim as the aircraft approaches the calculated take-off decision speed (V1). Normally, a rejected take-off (RTO) will be successful if initiated prior to reaching V1 and properly executed. Beyond V1, a RTO should only be considered should there be a strong reason to doubt the aircraftâ€™s ability to fly. Any ATC instruction to reject take-off issued after reaching V1 is likely to be considered as inappropriate. It is impossible for the controllers to assess when the aircraft is at or near that speed, therefore any instructions to reject take-off are most effective when they are issued during the early stage of the take off run.
