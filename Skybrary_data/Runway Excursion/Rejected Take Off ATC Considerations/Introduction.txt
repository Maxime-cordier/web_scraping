This article describes typical reasons for high speed rejected take-off events associated with inappropriate ATC instructions and identifies a number of potential mitigation actions to be implemented by ATCOs. It further provides an overview of the factors to be considered before issuing an instruction to reject take-off and identifies best defensive controlling techniques and practices. There is no set of ready out-of-the-box rules to be followed universally. The controllers should exercise their best judgment when dealing with rejected take-offs. The examples and advice provided in this article are not intended to be exhaustive and shall not have prejudice to local ATC procedures.
