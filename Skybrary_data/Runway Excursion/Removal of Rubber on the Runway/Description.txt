When an aircraft touches down, the landing gear weels start rotating. The friction forces peel some rubber off the tyres and this process continues until the wheel rotation speed matches the aircraft speed. Therefore, the touchdown zone is prone to rubber deposit accumulation. The adverse effects of these deposits are that they obliterate the runway markings (which may confuse the pilots). become slippery when wet (e.g. due to rain) which may contribute to a runway excursion.
