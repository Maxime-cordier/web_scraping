This article summarises the origin of wind velocity measurements made at airports and communicated to aircraft to assist their safe take off and landing. It also provides some guidance on how this information should be applied by flight crew, which concerns aircraft performance calculations, operating within prescribed AFM limits and the tactical handling of the aircraft during take off and landing.
