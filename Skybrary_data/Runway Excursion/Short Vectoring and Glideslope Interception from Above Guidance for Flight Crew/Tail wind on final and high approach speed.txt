This event can also be classified as a controller induced go around. However, once again, the pilots accepted the clearance, this time a speed restriction, without question. The video clearly demonstrates why both pilots and controllers need to be aware of, and make adjustments for, both runway wind and the winds on approach to ensure a successful, stabilised approach. For a 3 degree glide path, the 1000' stabilisation gate is located just over 3 miles from the runway threshold. Between that gate and the termination point of the speed restriction, there must be sufficient distance (time) for the aircraft to slow to approach speed and become compliant with all other stabilisation criteria. Whilst it is convenient to think of speed reduction in terms of knots lost per nautical mile flown (and many aircraft manufacturers provide information in those terms), this is an over simplification. In reality, it is actually knots lost per unit of time with the nominal time interval being that required to fly a mile while decelerating in no wind conditions. With that in mind, a speed reduction in headwind conditions will take less distance over the ground (than in still air) whereas in a tailwind, the ground distance will be increased, sometimes substantially. Controllers must either adjust the requested speed or the distance to which that speed is to be maintained (or both) in circumstances of strong tailwinds on approach. Controllers can determine the existing wind by pilot report or by comparing reported IAS with the ground speed of the aircraft. Pilots of modern aircraft generally have both wind and ground speed information available and, although one does not fly based on ground speed, they should be aware of the values and use the information to determine whether or not a speed restriction is appropriate and acceptable. If it is not, they must be prepared to refuse the clearance.
