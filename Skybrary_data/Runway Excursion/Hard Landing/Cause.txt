The most common cause of a hard landing is an unstable approach. Amongst other reasons, these can occur due to tailwind, a "rushed" approach, an attempt to comply with an overly demanding air traffic control clearance, adverse weather conditions or the improper use of automation. Abnormal speed or excessive rates of descent can make execution of the landing flare more difficult as the usual visual cues may be skewed or accelerated and the aircraft response to control inputs somewhat different to that normally experienced; that is, the input may cause the aircraft to balloon or, conversely, fail to arrest the descent. Gusty winds, active precipitation and reduced visibility can all make execution of the landing more difficult and can, therefore, increase the potential for a hard landing.
