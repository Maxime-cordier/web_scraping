The main reasons why runway excursions occur during rejected takeoffs can be categorised as: the decision to reject the takeoff is made after V1 and there is insufficient runway length left to come to a stop on it.. the flight crew actions required to achieve a rejected takeoff are not carried out in a sufficiently prompt and/or comprehensive manner.. stopping devices are not used to their full capacity.. directional control is not maintained during the takeoff roll.. it is found at Vr that it is impossible to achieve rotation..
