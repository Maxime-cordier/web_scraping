The Global Reporting Format (GRF) is a globally harmonized methodology for assessing and reporting runway surface conditions. The GRF was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to help mitigate the risk of runway excursions. The GRF is applicable globally on 4 Nov. 2021 after being delayed a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
