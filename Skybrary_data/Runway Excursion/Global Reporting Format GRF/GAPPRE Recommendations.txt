The Global Action Plan for the Prevention of Runway Excursions (GAPPRE) makes the following aerodrome-related recommendations relevant to runway surface condition reporting: Ensure that the procedures to assess runway surface conditions according to the GRF include reactive as well as proactive surface assessment to make sure hazardous changes are all identified and communicated in a timely manner.. Ensure robust procedures are in place for communicating information regarding changing surface conditions as frequently as practicable to the appropriate services according to the GRF. Roles, responsibilities of stakeholders and coordination procedures should be formalised.. Runway condition codes assessed should be compared against braking action reports by the pilots to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to the pilots..
