Best practice embedded in the ASSIST principle could be followed: (A - Acknowledge; S - Separate, S - Silence; I - Inform, S - Support, T - Time)A - acknowledge the gear problem, ask for the crews’ intentions when the situation permits, and establish whether the crew is able to extend the gear into locked position. Dtermine the number of souls on board (SOB); determine the aircraft fuel on board and endurance in minutes. Update the endurance value as appropriate to the situation but at least every 15-20 minutes to help reduce the potential for a fuel emergency (if the gear problem arises during approach the controllers may expect the declaration of minimum fuel or even an impending fuel emergency very soon as it may be very common today to arrive with less than 10 minutes of extra fuel in excess of minimum diversion fuel at the destination);S - separate the aircraft from other traffic, prioritise it for landing (allow long final if requested), keep the active runway clear of departures, arrivals and vehicles;S - silence the non-urgent calls (as required) and use separate frequency where possible;I - inform the airport emergency services and all concerned parties according to local procedures;S - support the flight experiencing gear problems with any information requested and deemed necessary (e.g. type of approach, runway length and aerodrome details, etc.);T - provide time for the crew to assess the situation, don’t press with non urgent matters.
