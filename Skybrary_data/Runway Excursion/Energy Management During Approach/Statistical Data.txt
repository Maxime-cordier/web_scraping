The Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) Approach-and-landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) Task Force found that unstabilised approaches (i.e. low/slow or high/fast approaches) were a causal factor in 66% of 76 approach-and-landing accidents and serious incidents worldwide in 1984 through 1997. These accidents involved incorrect management of aircraft energy, resulting in an excess or deficit of energy, as follows: Aircraft were low/slow on approach in 36 percent of the accidents/incidents; and,. Aircraft were high/fast on approach in 30 percent of the accidents/incidents..
