A baulked landing is an infrequent occurrence and is considered a high risk manoeuvre. Initiation of the baulked landing occurs from a very low height with the aircraft in a low energy state. Modified go around procedures are necessary, as standard actions could lead to loss of control. For many locations, obstacle clearance mitigation strategies must be considered to reduce the potential for CFIT.
