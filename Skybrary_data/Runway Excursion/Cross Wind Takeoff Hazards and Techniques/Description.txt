Poorly executed cross wind takeoffs, or attempting a takeoff when the cross wind component is beyond the Manufacturer's limit for the aircraft type, can lead to runway excursions. That outcome is often associated with prevailing runway surface friction being other than dry - possibly wet but more often contaminated. Some of the issues following also apply to the maintenance of directional control during a landing. Runway excursion on landing is a more common occurrence than during takeoff and is covered in the article Cross Wind Landings.
