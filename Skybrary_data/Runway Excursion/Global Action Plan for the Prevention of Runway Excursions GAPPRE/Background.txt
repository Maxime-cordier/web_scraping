Runway excursion is the most frequent accident type in aviation, represents one of the most serious risks in aviation and is one of the most economically significant safety events. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 2020 Annual Safety Review categorizes runway excursions as one of the top two key risk areas for large aeroplanes. An International Air Transport Association (IATA) study of incident and accident data found that from 2005 through the first half of 2019 approximately 23 percent of the accidents in IATA’s global accident database involved runway excursion. It has been estimated that the direct cost of runway excursion events in 2019 was more than US$4 billion. Data shows that the industry has been effective in reducing the rate of commercial aviation runway excursion accidents, but the absolute number of accidents and incidents and their severity indicate a very high risk. Runway excursion risk is a complex combination of factors involving different segments of the aviation industry including operators, airports, aircraft manufacturers and air navigation service providers. Mitigating the risk is best done cooperatively among the stakeholders. The complexity of runway excursion prevention efforts is derived from the fact that the effect of the risk and resilience factors is highly cumulative – runway condition maintenance and reporting; aircraft performance and operations; collaborative approach path management; and adherence to robust policies for safe descent and approach planning, stabilised approach, safe landing and go-around all play roles.
