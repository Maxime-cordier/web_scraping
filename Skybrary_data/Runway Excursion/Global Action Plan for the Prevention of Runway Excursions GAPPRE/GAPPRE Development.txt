The Global Action Plan for the Prevention of Runway Excursions (GAPPRE) was developed by an international group of aviation professionals from more than 40 different organisations divided into six working groups. The work was coordinated by EUROCONTROL and Flight Safety Foundation (FSF). GAPPRE was reviewed and validated by EASA, IATA, the Civil Air Navigations Services Organisation (CANSO) and Airports Council International (ACI). GAPPRE comprises a set of consensus-based recommendations representing industry best practices and interventions that go beyond regulatory compliance. The recommendations address both risk and resilience factors. Some of the recommendations can be addressed and implemented right away and others will need to be developed over time.
