The landing flare is executed during a critical phase of flight and, except for autoland operations, is dependent upon the judgement, skill and experience of the pilot. There are numerous potential threats that can affect the outcome of the manoeuvre. These include: Excessive speed during final approach: B738, Mangalore India, 2010 E145, Nuremberg Germany, 2005 GLF4, Teterboro NJ USA, 2010. B738, Mangalore India, 2010. E145, Nuremberg Germany, 2005. GLF4, Teterboro NJ USA, 2010. Excessive rate of descent during final approach: MD11, Hong Kong China, 1999. MD11, Hong Kong China, 1999. Initiating the flare at a height which is either too high (early flare) or too low (late flare): MD11, Riyadh Saudi Arabia, 2010: Late Flare B734, Amsterdam Netherlands, 2010 (1): Early Flare. MD11, Riyadh Saudi Arabia, 2010: Late Flare. B734, Amsterdam Netherlands, 2010 (1): Early Flare. Insufficient flare which could fail to arrest the rate of descent or fail to achieve landing attitude prior to touchdown: A321, Manchester UK, 2008 (1). A321, Manchester UK, 2008 (1). Overly aggressive pitch changes which could result in ballooning (altitude gain). Inappropriate power/thrust reductions including any one of, or combinations of, too early, too late, too little or too much: CRJ2, Providence RI USA, 2007: Early DH8D, London Gatwick UK, 2009: Early D328, Mannheim Germany, 2008: Too little, late. CRJ2, Providence RI USA, 2007: Early. DH8D, London Gatwick UK, 2009: Early. D328, Mannheim Germany, 2008: Too little, late. Excessive hold off: CRJ7, Kanpur India, 2011 MD11, New York JFK USA, 2003. CRJ7, Kanpur India, 2011. MD11, New York JFK USA, 2003.
