The ESIMS Programme relies on the conduct of safety oversight audits to individual States. The conduct of the safety oversight audits is organised around two phases: In the first, the State’s organisation and establishment of safety oversight mechanisms and the implementation of ESARRs, is determined through the review of the duly completed Compliance Checklists for all relevant ESARRs, and through the review of other documents and information relevant to the scope of the ESIMS audits.. In the second phase, the State being audited is visited by a EUROCONTROL audit team, who will validate the information provided by the State and conduct an on-site audit of the State’s overall safety oversight capability, focusing on the areas covered by relevant ESARRs, and tailored to the size and level of complexity of aviation activities in the State audited.. States are asked to develop a corrective action plan, within an agreed period, to resolve any unfavourable findings. The implementation of the action plan is monitored by EUROCONTROL through follow-up activities. The States that participated in the ESIMS Programme are the EUROCONTROL Member States and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Member States who are not members of EUROCONTROL and who have agreed to participate in the ESIMS Programme.
