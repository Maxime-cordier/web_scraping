ESARRs further expand upon ICAO SARPS or address areas not covered by ICAO annexes. The EUROCONTROL SRC has reviewed the need for States to file differences to ICAO standards as a consequence of implementing ESARRs. Only one case has been identified on the understanding that ‘where national regulations of States call for compliance with procedures that are not identical but essentially the same… no difference should be reported…’ . It is recommended that States, having implemented ESARR 2, need to file a difference to the provisions of ICAO Annex 13, Chapter 8 only if they have not implemented a mandatory incident reporting system or if a voluntary system does not have appropriate non-punitive provisions.
