ESARR 5 sets out the general safety regulatory requirements for all ATM services’ personnel responsible for safety related tasks within the provision of ATM services across the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) area, as well as specific safety regulatory requirements for air traffic controllers and for engineering and technical personnel undertaking operational safety related tasks. The overall objective of the requirement is to ensure the competency and, where applicable, the satisfaction of medical requirements, of ATM services’ personnel responsible for safety related tasks within the provision of ATM services. ESARR 5 develops further ESARR3 requirements on competency. The basis for development of the safety regulatory requirements relating to air traffic controllers is International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Annex 1. It is to be noted that provisions are not foreseen in ICAO SARPS in respect of the mentioned category of technical and engineering ATM personnel.
