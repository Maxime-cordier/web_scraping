In order to achieve a harmonised European air traffic management system, EUROCONTROL Member States have agreed to implement a range of EUROCONTROL Safety Regulatory Requirements (ESARRs), aimed at defining minimum levels of ATM safety for implementation by States, within a total aviation safety system approach. ECAC States which are not members of the EUROCONTROL Organisation, are strongly encouraged to implement ESARRs to ensure consistent safety levels in ECAC. The safety regulatory authorities of the EUROCONTROL member states are responsible for the transposition of the ESARR provisions into national safety regulatory requirements. To date, six ESARRs are in force. ESARR 2 addresses the Reporting and Assessment of Safety Occurrences in ATM. In the case of each ESARR, it is the intention to support ESARR implementation through the publication of ESARR Advisory Material.
