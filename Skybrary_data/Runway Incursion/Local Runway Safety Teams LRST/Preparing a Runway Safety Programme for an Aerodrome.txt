A runway safety programme should demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the safety implications of several key factors. These include the runway and taxiway layout, the effects of the traffic intensity and mix, the taxiway designations, and both visual and non-visual aids such as markings, lighting and signage. The context provided by AYS procedures, including the use of radar systems and communication of the prevailing runway safety situation through the AIP and through NOTAMS, also should be recognised in the programme. Each action item should include designation of a responsible person or organisation for completing the item's relevant tasks. There may be more than one person or organisation affected by an action item; however, one person or organisation should take the lead and be responsible for the completion of all the tasks associated with that action item. A realistic time frame to accomplish the tasks should also be associated with each action item. The aerodrome LRST can also consider the operating procedures employed by different companies at the aerodrome. As noted, one objective for a runway safety programme will be to create or enhance procedures that minimise the risk of runway incursions and runway excursions. Extra care should be taken when examining existing or proposed runway capacity enhancing procedures and noise abatement schemes involving preferential runway systems. A major lesson learned from aerodrome LRSTs' experiences to date is that it may be unrealistic to presume all flights crews are familiar with local runway procedures. So LRSTs must write their runway safety programme with that basic understanding and corresponding mitigations. Another lesson learned is the likelihood that runway safety difficulties may be encountered at aerodromes where compliance with ICAO SARPs has not been respected.
