While the term "holding position" is used in ICAO documents, it is replaced by "holding point" in radio-telephony. A controller taxi instruction would be something similar to: Airjet 123, taxi to holding point runway 22. The name of the holding position as well as the taxi route (i.e. which taxiways are to be used and in what order) would be added to the taxi clearance if there is a risk of confusion. The reason for substituting "position" with "point" is that a similar sounding instruction existed in the United States, "Taxi into position and hold" which had a completely different meaning - it was an authorization to line up on the active runway. Therefore, in order to avoid confusion and reduce the risk of runway incursions, the ICAO radio-telephony term was changed. In September 2010 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) amended JO 7110.65 (Air Traffic Control) by replacing the phrase "Taxi into position and hold (TIPH)" with "Line up and wait (LUAW)".
