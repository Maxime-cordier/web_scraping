The procedures for application of multiple line-ups are described in ICAO Doc 7030, Part 3 - European Regional Supplementary Procedures, Section 3.1.1: Line-up instructions may be issued to more than one aircraft at different points on the same runway taking into account that intersection take-off criteria shall be complied with, provided that: a) minimum visibility is established by the appropriate authority. Those minima shall permit the controller and the pilot to continuously observe the position of the relevant aircraft on the manoeuvring area by visual reference; b) local considerations, such as the airport layout, available radar equipment and local weather phenomena, are defined. The effect of jet blast/prop wash shall be taken into consideration; c) air traffic service for aircraft involved in multiple line-ups on the same runway is provided on the same radio frequency; d) pilots shall be advised of the position of any essential traffic on the same runway; e) the slope of the runway does not render preceding aircraft in the departure sequence invisible to succeeding aircraft on the same runway; f) pilot readback of line-up instructions is required and contains the runway designator, the name of the intersection (if applicable) and the number in the departure sequence; and g) wake turbulence separation is applied.
