An airport has two runways, runway 01/19 and a crossing runway 08/26. Two ramp areas exists, the main one located west of threshold runway 19 and north of runway 08/26, a smaller on the opposite side of threshold runway 19. There are no taxiways east of runway 01/19 except for a short intersection from runway 08/26 to the minor apron. Weather: summer conditions, good visibility, overcast and daylight. The red aircraft, a general aviation jet aircraft, lands on runway 19. Being unfamiliar with the airport it proceeds slowly on the runway, exiting to the right. Following instructions from the controller it proceeds slowly north on taxiway Alpha, a taxiway parallel to runway 19. The clearance also includes instructions to turn right east on runway 08, to hold short of runway 01/19. The controller ensures that the stop bar on runway 08 at the holding point for runway 01/19 is activated (no paint or signs mark the holding point). In addition, the holding point has runway guard lights on each side of runway 08. Turning on to runway 08, the pilot slightly increases the taxi speed. On the other side (i.e. east of runway 19) a "follow me" vehicle waits without any lights activated. The flight crew on the general aviation aircraft cross the holding point and stop a few metres from runway 19 where a landing aircraft (yellow) crosses in front of them. ICAO Annex 2, para 3.2.2.7.2 states “An aircraft taxiing on the manoeuvring area shall stop and hold at all runway holding positions unless otherwise authorized by the aerodrome control tower”. ICAO Doc. 4444, para 7.5.3.1.1.2 however states “When a taxi clearance contains a taxi limit beyond a runway, it shall contain an explicit clearance to cross or an instruction to hold short of that runway”. ICAO Doc. 4444 can be seen as concerning ATC only. If a clearance to a point beyond a runway is given without an explicit clearance to cross the runway, the pilot may mistakenly believe that ATC has authorised the crossing in accordance with ICAO Annex 2.
