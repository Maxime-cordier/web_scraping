The following points could be considered when developing SOPs for follow me vehicles: Ensure that the vehicle's ‘bridge’ lights or ‘light bar’ are not switched on until the marshalling actually starts.. If appropriate, ATC may make clear to pilots where the marshalling begins and ends.. In some circumstances it may be better to mention the presence/use of ‘Follow Me’ vehicles/marshallers only at the last minute to avoid confusing the pilot.. As a rule, ‘Follow Me’ vehicles should not be positioned on the far side of an active runway that needs to be crossed as part of the taxiing; however, there is a potential downside to this since it may involve an additional crossing of the active runway by the ‘Follow Me’ vehicle for it to be in the correct location. (see example scenario below). ‘Follow Me’ vehicles may be used in LVPs - but pilots need to know when the marshalling ends, e.g. at the Holding Point, and not be tempted to continue following a 'Follow Me’ vehicle that has completed its function..
