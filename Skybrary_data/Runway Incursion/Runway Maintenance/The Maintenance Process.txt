The integrity of runway surfaces is assured by regular inspections. Pavement maintenance requires periodic renewal of the top or wearing surface. The interval between surface re-making will vary according to the type of surface. The most commonly used hard surface types are concrete and asphalt. To aid surface water dispersal, the former is frequently grooved laterally to allow surface water to drain in the grooves and the latter employ a porous top layer, which allows surface water to run off below the surface rather than across it. Certain types of asphalt can also be grooved. Minor repairs such as joint re-sealing, crack stopping and the removal of rubber deposits from the TDZ may need relatively little continuous occupancy time but major works will either involve complete or partial runway closure for a continuous period of several weeks or a carefully managed programme of night closures during which a complex resurfacing programme can be progressively accomplished. In such cases, the friction characteristics of various parts of the available surface may vary on a daily basis which will invite very careful pre flight attention to NOTAM information, especially if adverse weather conditions may occur.
