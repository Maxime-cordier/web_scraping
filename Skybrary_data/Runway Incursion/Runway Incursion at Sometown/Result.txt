What happened? Well, the two groups of controllers were fighting each other, and the number of reported runway incursions increased from 15 for the first six months 2006 to 46 for the last part of the year. The pilots were complaining, the new strict sector borders often resulted in an extra stop by runway 18/36 and an extra frequency change made no pilot happy. In addition the Airport Operator, although at first supporting the change, now was not pleased at all. But there were no serious incidents similar to those reported before the change. What are the lessons learned? The full extent of the problem became visible. Force of habit is enormous. Perhaps this was an area where the method of handling the traffic was smart and smooth, but not necessary always perfectly safe. The change seems at least to have made it safer, but it needs acceptance from the operational people involved. This will take time.
