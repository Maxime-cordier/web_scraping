Two taxiing aircraft from runway 09R avoided collision only by one pilot braking hard to avoid the other aircraft. The incident happened on runway 18/36; the first aircraft taxiing towards the apron via runway 18/36 was under control of an Apron Controller, while the second aircraft about to cross the same runway, was on an ATC Tower frequency. The part of the runway where the incident occurred was temporarily handed over from the ATC Tower to the Apron Tower and a third person, an Apron Controller.
