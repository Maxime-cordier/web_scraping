An ARIWS operates based on a surveillance system which is designed and sited to monitor the existing situation on a runway and which automatically transmits this information to warning lights located at both the runway takeoff threshold and at selected runway entrances. The system provides warnings as follows: When an aircraft arriving at a runway is short final or one departing from the runway has commenced its takeoff roll, red warning lights at the runway entrances will illuminate, indicating that it is unsafe to enter or cross the runway.. When an aircraft on the runway threshold awaiting takeoff and another aircraft or vehicle enters or crosses the runway, red warning lights will illuminate at the threshold area, indicating that it is unsafe to commence the takeoff roll.. For a more complete description, refer to the article Runway Status Lights (RWSL) In general terms, an ARIWS consists of an independent surveillance system, be it primary radar, multilateration, specialized cameras, dedicated radar or some other detection tool, and a warning system in the form of extra airfield lighting systems which are connected through a processor which generates alerts directly to the flight crew or vehicle operator independent of ATS input or action.
