An airport which has approved procedures to continue with aircraft movements in low forward visibility will have a formal set of procedures which apply whenever Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) are declared to be in force. Typically, all non-essential airside vehicular traffic will be prohibited and remaining traffic will be required to drive within reduced speed limits and use different runway entry holding points. In addition, taxiway and runway lighting will be in use which may not necessarily be the case otherwise during daylight.
