Improving the awareness of both flight crew and vehicle drivers of the entrance points to active runways, continues to be a major feature of attempts to reduce runway incursions. Surface markings of runway holding points and their accompanying signage may be supported by lit stop bars and runway guard lights. Whilst Runway Guard Lights are usually operated in day or night conditions and lit stop bars are now usually controllable from the TWR, the use of lit stop bars is sometimes restricted to use at night and during Low Visibility Procedures (LVP).
