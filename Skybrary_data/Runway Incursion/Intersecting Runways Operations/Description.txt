Many airports have intersecting runways, often as a consequence of expansion but also to provide a minimal crosswind option where wind direction is variable. Although the use of both runways simultaneously may serve to increase flight efficiency, shorter approach tracks and taxi routes for example, there are significant inherent risks associated with simultaneous operation of intersecting runways; strict procedures must be in place to prevent a runway incursion. In terms of total throughput, using just one runway in mixed mode will in most cases provide a similar capacity to that which is possible with both runways operating, but with a substantially reduced potential for runway incursion incidents.
