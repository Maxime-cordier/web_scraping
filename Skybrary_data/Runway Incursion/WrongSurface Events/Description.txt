The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) are among the regulators and industry organisations that have warned since 2017 about an increasing trend of what are variously described as wrong-surface events, incorrect-airport surface approaches and landings, or Wrong Runway Use. FAA defines a wrong-surface event as occurring “when an aircraft lands or departs, or tries to land or depart, on the wrong runway or on a taxiway. It also occurs when an aircraft lands or tries to land at the wrong airport.”.
