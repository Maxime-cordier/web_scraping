Fewer formalities – since most of these aerodromes are domestic, some features such as security checks, customs, etc. are either absent or simplified.. Less time-consuming – the time between the arrival at the aerodrome and the take-off is usually much less at small aerodromes due to the few formalities and low air traffic levels.. Cheaper - services such as vehicle and aircraft parking are usually much cheaper as compared to large aerodromes.. Simple layout - most small aerodromes only have one runway and a few taxiways. This makes it easier for trainees and novice pilots to use the aerodrome.. Low traffic levels make such aerodromes convenient for pilot training, especially PPL training.
