Financing – most of the small aerodromes do not produce sufficient revenue to be able to afford services such as air traffic control, a MET office, rescue and fire fighting services, medical staff, etc nor are they likely to provide ATIS or precision approach capability such as an ILS. Insufficient funds can also lead to safety and security issues.. Security – most small aerodromes only offer the most basic means of security (if any), such as perimeter fencing.. Runway incursions – this is one of the main issues, related to small aerodromes. Some of the contributing factors are: Higher percentage of non-professional pilots (compared to e.g. large international aerodromes) Easy passenger access to the apron (and from there to the maneuvering area, and runway). Limited or lack of air traffic services. Relatively few flights which can easily cause negligence or reduced vigilance amongst passengers and staff, including but not limited to pilots leaving passengers unattended, passengers roaming freely, vehicles unequipped with radio or the radio not being used, etc..
