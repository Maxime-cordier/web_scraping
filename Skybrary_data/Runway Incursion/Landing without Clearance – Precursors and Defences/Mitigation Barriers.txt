Sometimes all prevention barriers are breached and the aircraft lands without a clearance, causing a runway incursion. In such cases, mitigation barriers may activate to prevent incidents. The most effective mitigation barriers are: ATCO prevents conflict after detecting it with system support before or with an intended RWY entry clearance.. Runway conflict resolution by flight crew/vehicle driver after detecting the risk with system support. This is in fact an airborne safety net to help flight crew in identification and resolution of runway conflicts.. Crew/driver prevents conflict after detecting it, based on traffic monitoring (listening to R/T or visually), before or with an intended RWY entry clearance. This barrier is relatively weak but offers the benefit of a “double” opportunity for conflict detection – visual and listening to the R/T.. Runway conflict resolution by flight crew/driver after visual conflict detection. This barrier is relatively weak but offers the benefit of limited delay (no need of an ATC-crew communication loop) for crew action in case of conflict detection..
