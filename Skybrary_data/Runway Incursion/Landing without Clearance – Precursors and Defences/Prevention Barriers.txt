Prevention barriers are intended to reduce or eliminate safety risks. Studies have shown that the following barriers have the greatest potential to prevent a landing without clearance: Alert to the pilot via ATC for lack of landing clearance, e.g. selection of visual alert.. Automatic alert to the pilot for occupied runway (for example visual alert in the case of Final Approach Runway Status Signal type of Runway Status Lights).. System supported detection by the ATCO of landing aircraft or of potential conflict for the landing aircraft (for example ASMGCS and RIMCAS).. ATCO memory aid for issued (not issued) landing clearances (correct positioning of the flight information strips, use of electronic flight strips in order to distinguish issued/not issued landing clearance according to the local procedures)..
