The following barriers, when deployed and employed correctly, are capable of alerting ATC to a runway incursion or a ground safety event in sufficient time for ATC to act in order to prevent a ground collision: ATCO direct visual detection;. ATCO visual detection using remote camera displays;. ATCO detection following pilot/driver report;. ATCO detection using basic SMR;. ATCO detection it using A-SMGCS level 1;. ATCO detection it after alert from A-SMGCS level 2;. ATCO detection after alert from ITWP;. ATCO detection after alert from airport ground systems that detect entry onto the runway (e.g. magnetic loops or lasers).. Depending on the stage of the conflict, all these (except for the last one) can be either prevention or mitigation barriers. They give the controller a chance of a last-minute conflict resolution.
