It must be possible to adjust the intensity of runway lighting so as to be suitable for the full range of horizontal visibility and ambient light in which use of the runway is intended. It must also be compatible with the intensity set for the nearest section of the approach lighting system, when such a system is also provided. Flight crew can be expected to request ATC to adjust runway lighting intensity in order to ensure that, for their particular case, it is of sufficient intensity to be useful but not so bright as to hinder overall visual clarity. Whilst automatic or careful manual control of lighting intensity based upon the degree of available natural light will produce a generally acceptable lighting intensity, the intensity preferred by a particular crew may differ because of variation in pilot eye height above the runway surface (broadly proportional to aircraft size) or because of the effect of the reflective properties of moisture particles when forward visibility is restricted.
