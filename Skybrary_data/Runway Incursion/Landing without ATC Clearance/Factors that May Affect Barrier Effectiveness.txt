Each aerodrome has its own specific set of features that may affect the prevention and mitigation barriers (some of these may also vary with time): Radar guided approaches (affect the possibility of communication loss being detected when transponder code 7600 is used);. Meteorological conditions (in-flight/ground visibility affect the pilots’/controllers’ ability to detect potential threats in good time);. Runway status (active, inactive, closed);. Clearance conditions (multiple clearances, conditional clearances, procedures for issuing landing clearances);. Physical visibility (control tower position, aerodrome layout, temporary obstacles)..
