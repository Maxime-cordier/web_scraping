When, for any reason, it is judged that an approach or landing cannot be continued to a successful landing, a missed approach or go-around shall be flown. Reasons for discontinuing an approach or landing may include the following: The required visual references have not been established by the Decision Altitude/Height (DA/DH) or Minimum Descent Altitude/Height (MDA/MDH) or is acquired but is subsequently lost;. The approach or landing is, or has become unstabilised;. The aircraft is not positioned so as to allow a controlled touch down within the designated runway touchdown zone with a consequent risk of aircraft damage with or without a Runway Excursion if the attempt is continued;. The runway is obstructed;. Landing clearance has not been received or is issued and later cancelled;. A go-around is being flown for training purposes with ATC approval..
