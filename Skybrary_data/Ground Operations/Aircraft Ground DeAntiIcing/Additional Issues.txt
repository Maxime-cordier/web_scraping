Use of thickened Type 2 and Type 4 ground de/anti icing fluids has sometimes resulted in fluid residues accumulating in aerodynamically quiet areas of the external airframe structure, particularly in the gap between the leading edge of the elevator and the horizontal stabiliser and also in the gap between the leading edge of the ailerons and the wing structure. When this residue is subsequently re-hydrated and then exposed to sub zero temperatures in flight, it freezes and can then result in primary flight control restrictions on aircraft types such as the BAE 146/Avro RJ series and the DC9/MD 80/90 series which have at least some unpowered flight controls. After a number of Serious Incident Reports, many Operators of affected aircraft types have adapted their aircraft maintenance procedures to carry out appropriate inspections and residue removal when these fluids have been applied.
