The mitigation of risks associated with refuelling is described in the article Refuelling with Passengers on Board. Passengers should be instructed to remain seated while the aircraft is taxiing to reduce the risk of injuries. While it is standard procedure for airlines to make an announcement stating that all passengers are to remain in their seats after landing until the aircraft has come to a full stop, there are passengers who choose to ignore the message. In such cases it is up to the cabin attendants to intervene and make sure that the passengers comply with the instructions.
