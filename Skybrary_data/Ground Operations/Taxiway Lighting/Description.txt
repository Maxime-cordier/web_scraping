The purpose of taxiway lighting is to help ensure that both flight crew and vehicle drivers follow the correct taxiway routings at night and in low visibility and correctly stop as their ATC clearance limits. Lighting embedded in the useable surface of a taxiway or marking the edge of available movement areas can be expected to follow the international standards specified in ICAO SARPs unless information to the contrary is published for a particular airport in a State AIP. Taxiway lighting is designated as either high intensity or low intensity. Lighting provided in support of low visibility operations can normally have the degree of luminance remotely selected to suit environmental conditions. The intensity options are usually set up by the ANSP, which will have operational control of the lighting system; the settings can be varied upon request by the user. The performance specification for high intensity lighting is defined by the need to provide guidance by day in low visibility conditions; the highest intensity settings are normally used in these conditions. Lower intensities are suitable for night operations. Low intensity lighting is provided where operations are carried out at night but not in low visibility conditions and the luminance intensity is normally not adjustable.
