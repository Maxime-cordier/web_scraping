These are provided at LVP airports and consist of a row of lights spaced evenly across the taxiway normally at right angles to the centreline and showing red towards an approaching aircraft when lit. Where installed, they are positioned before all taxiway/runway intersections (see Runway Status Lights (RWSL)) and may also be provided at other appropriate points within the taxiway system. At some airports where a Stop Bar is located on or close to a bend in a taxiway, additional elevated red lights may be positioned just beyond each edge of the taxiway so as to improve awareness of the Stop Bar location.
