There are four basic hand signals (see illustrations below) that ground rescue and fire-fighting personnel are expected to understand and use clearly during emergencies to communicate with flight deck and/or cabin crew, and which all crew members should understand the meaning. As well as just hands, these signals can be made with a variety of paddles, batons and wands â€“ both lit and unlit.
