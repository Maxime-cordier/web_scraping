Hand signals are used, on aerodromes, as either primary or back-up communication for many different tasks and between a wide-range of personnel. These include ground marshallers giving steering directions to pilots; pilots indicating the application of handbrakes to ground crew; cabin crew communicating with step drivers; and de-icing operatives giving pilots the “all clear”. To avoid misinterpretation it is important that hand signals are unambiguous, clearly and precisely delivered, and universally understood. To help achieve this, Appendix 1 to ICAO Annex 2 Rules of the Air includes descriptions and pictures of the main marshalling, and emergency, hand signals; these have been reproduced[1]by many National Authorities and trade organisations. The ICAO list is not comprehensive, for example, it does not include hand signals to relay typical messages during de-icing and anti-icing operations. Commercial pilots operating from some military facilities may also be unfamiliar with some hand signals used in these places[2].
