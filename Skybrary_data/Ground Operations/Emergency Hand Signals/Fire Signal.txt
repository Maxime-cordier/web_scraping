ICAO describes this signal as moving the right-hand wand in a "fanning" motion from shoulder to knee, while at the same time pointing with the left-hand wand to area of fire (which might be an engine, APU, brake, or elsewhere). IFALPA also indicates that the signal could be made with a rapid horizontal figure-of-eight motion at waist level with either arm, pointing at the source of fire with the other arm[3].
