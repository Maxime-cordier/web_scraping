The great majority of collisions occurring whilst approaching, on, or leaving the gate are preventable. Robust training, appropriate and well promulgated procedures, consistent adherence to those procedures and a mature Safety Management System (SMS) all play a role in collision prevention. In particular flight and ground crew should: ensure gate assignment is appropriate to the aircraft type. maintain the gate centerline whilst approaching and pushing off the gate. ensure that the gate safety areas are clear whilst the aircraft is approaching or departing the gate. be aware of wing and tail clearance at all times and using wing walkers when appropriate. make appropriate use of marshalling services both when the aircraft is approaching the gate and when vehicles are approaching the aircraft.
