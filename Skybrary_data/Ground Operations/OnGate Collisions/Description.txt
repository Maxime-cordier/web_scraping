An airport is a complex interface between the air and the ground environments, where access must be controlled and separation between aircraft or between aircraft and vehicular traffic must be maintained and optimised. While most occurrences on airport aprons and taxiways do not have consequences in terms of loss of life, they are often associated with aircraft damage, delays to passengers and avoidable financial costs. This article examines collisions whilst aircraft are on, approaching or departing their assigned gate. The article Taxiway Collisions provides insight into collisions occurring on the airport taxiway environment.
