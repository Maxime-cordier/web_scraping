Since various organisations and different professions are involved in the aircraft turnaround process, RRM training should ideally be provided by airports as part of their Safety Management System (SMS) activities, as prescribed in ICAO Annex 14, or to fulfil proposed amendments. GSP’s, in turn, may provide additional RRM training which addresses the particulars of the GSP’s organisation and procedures. Other options include that RRM training is provided by airlines that operate a ground services department, by organisations involved in cargo handling, aircraft catering or cleaning, or by other independent organisations with the required instructor skills and expertise, like aviation training providers, safety institutes or consulting agencies. RRM training should be provided when ramp workers apply for an airside badge, and is preferably given after the basic airside safety training has been completed. Recurrent training may be provided at badge renewal or at shorter time intervals when deemed appropriate or necessary by the organisations involved. A training course is only as good as its instructor or facilitator. The selection of the right instructor is paramount to the success of the course. Some background in team training, (safety) culture, psychology and/or human factors is recommended. However, the most important instructor attributes are motivation to deliver the course and a belief in the benefits of the content. RRM training is a useful tool to improve ground handling safety. However, it is only one of many tools required in a safety management system. All these tools should be used to make a positive impact on safety.
