The great majority of ULD are designed and sold as certified ULD, however there are some exceptions. These can be identified by the first letter of their identification code: Certified container: A. Non Certified container: D. Certified pallet: P. Non-certified pallet: F. Certified ULD must be used on all aircraft which have holds that are of insufficient strength to contain their contents during extreme flight conditions and rely on the ULD being locked to the floor of the hold. Non certified ULD may be used in an aircraft having a hold structure which is deemed capable of withstanding the forces from the contents during extreme flight conditions. An example of this is the B767 Series, which not only has holds designed to withstand these forces but also uses a base size for its containers that is unique to the aircraft type (units known as DPE (LD2), DQP (LD4) and DQF (LD8)). While airlines may choose to make their own definitions as to exactly what types of ULD may or may not be loaded on their aircraft, it should be remembered that many ULD are transferred between aircraft and even other airlines before reaching their destination. Whether certified or non certified, no damaged ULD or pallet should be used for aircraft loading purposes.
