Containers are typically lightweight structures comprising a structure of aluminium extrusions, a relatively thick ( 2.5mm - 4mm) aluminium base sheet, aluminium or composite side and roof panels, and a fabric or metal door. By necessity they are made as light as possible, however they may be subjected to extremely severe handling conditions. The rapid growth of air travel, especially air cargo, over the past 10 years has resulted in some ULDs being handled in sub standard facilities using inappropriate handling practices. Any resulting damage is not only a cost to aircraft operators but may also creates a condition which is hazardous to aircraft safety. The various published industry standards covering handling of ULD all call for ULD to be supported at all times on dollies/roller beds/racking. These standards also state clearly that unless a ULD is specifically designed to be handled by a forklift it should not be so handled; otherwise damage may result.
