The solutions to these safety risks are found in: Provision of correct ULD handling infrastructure, guidance for which can be found in the IATA Airport Handling Manual. While such equipment is not cheap it is a necessity when it comes to ULD handling.. Provision of training to all parties handling ULD to ensure correct procedures are followed. ULD may look simple, indeed a person loading ULD maybe considered less skilled than - say - a driver, however the person loading a ULD is actually performing a flight safety critical function, and can put the lives of all on board the aircraft at risk. “On the Job” training delivered by a worker who likely has had no formal training himself is not a sufficient method to manage to risks associated with ULD operations.. Sufficient diligence by all parties in the ULD process to ensure that safety breaches are not allowed “just this time” but are caught and rectified each time. Letting an unserviceable or badly loaded ULD go “just this time” is as dangerous as ignoring any other defect on an aircraft and should never be permitted. An unserviceable ULD should never make it to the aircraft door, the defects should be picked up at the pre loading inspection and the ULD rejected at that stage by having suitably trained staff carrying out the loading process.. A culture of “ask if not sure” needs to be observed. Guess work has no place in flight safety and this applies to ULD operations as much as to any other field of aviation..
