Given the variety of different SEG systems with apparently similar indications, crews should ensure they understand which SEG system they are using and what to expect under normal operation. Flight crew need to check that the SEG system markings/displays correspond to their aircraft type. Flight crew operating more than one aircraft type variant or who may have recently undergone type conversion need to be absolutely sure they cross check the appropriate type/variant they are operating with what is marked / displayed on the SEG system. Whenever an aircraft is taxyed onto a gate, it should be done at a very low speed and the aircraft braking system status should be checked upon arrival at the turn-in point to ensure that this system is functioning normally. Fixed rather than moveable air bridges are less common than they used to be. When they are encountered, they are likely to result in closer proximity to moving aircraft than for the more common movable bridges. The closeness of the fixed bridge reduces the margin for error by the person taxying an aircraft onto the gate. Movable bridges will have a stowed position marked on the stand surface; the airbridge should be positioned within the marked area when not in use. If the airbridge is not correctly stowed then the aircraft should not continue towards the parking position.
