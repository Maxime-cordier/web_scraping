A stand identifier should be passed to the flight crew before approaching the parking stand. Whatever type of guidance system is in use, it is important to check that the stand displays the correct stand identifier and, where displayed, the correct aircraft type. Airport procedures should specify which aircraft types are permitted to use which gates, though this does not necessarily mean the information is published where it is available for operating flight crew. Flight Crew on board documentation should provide equivalent information. Allocation of an appropriate gate will depend upon the Flight Plan having been filed with the correct aircraft type and variant. Errors in this area are particularly common when a flight operates on a stored RPL and an aircraft substitution, even just a variant, is made.
