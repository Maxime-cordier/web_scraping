The TALPA Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) set up by the U.S. FAA proposed the following corrective actions: New standards for runway condition assessment and reporting. Correlation of the reported runway condition with aircraft performance data. New operational rules for landing performance calculation at the time of arrival.. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) developed an improved global runway condition assessment and reporting format based on the proposals of the TALPA ARC. The methodology, intended for global application, relies on the following: An agreed set of criteria used in a consistent manner for runway surface condition assessment, aircraft (performance) certification and operational performance calculation;. A unique Runway Condition Code (RWYCC) linking the agreed set of criteria with the aircraft performance data, which can be correlated to the braking action experienced and reported by flight crews; and. A standardised common terminology for runway surface condition description reported by the airport operatorâ€™s runway assessors, air traffic controllers and Aeronautical Information Services (AIS) for use by flight crews..
