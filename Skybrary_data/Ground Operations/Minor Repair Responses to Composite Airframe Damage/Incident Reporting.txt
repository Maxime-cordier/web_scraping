A major issue with composite airframes is that minor surface damage does not accurately reflect the extent of damage beneath the surface. What may appear to be insignificant damage on the surface could mask damage to the layers of material beneath the surface, compromising its strength. This could allow an aircraft with potentially significant damage to be operated. Therefore, ramp workers need to be aware of the importance of reporting even minor (or what appears to be minor) contact with the aircraft. As most ramp employees may not have sufficient knowledge about composite aircraft maintenance, it is critical that supervisors know that even the most minor damage needs to be reported.
