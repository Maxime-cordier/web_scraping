International Air Transport Association (IATA) Resolution 753 (R753) on baggage tracking, effective 1 June 2018, requires IATA member carriers to maintain an accurate inventory of passenger baggage by monitoring the acquisition and delivery of baggage. The intent of R753, according to IATA, is to encourage airlines to further reduce mishandling by implementing cross-industry tracking for every baggage journey. Implementation of R753 is being driven by IATA, Airlines For America (A4A) and Airports Council International (ACI). Under terms of R753, and a similar A4A resolution, member carriers of the two organisations are obligated to demonstrate delivery of baggage when custody changes; demonstrate acquisition of baggage when custody changes; provide an inventory of bags upon departure of a flight; and be capable of exchanging this information with other members or their agents as necessary. In addition, R753 sets a minimum of four recorded bag tracking points: Acquisition of the bag from the passenger by the member carrier or its agent;. Delivery of the bag to the aircraft;. Delivery and acquisition of the bag between member or their agents when custody changes between carriers; and,. Delivery of the bag to the passenger.. RFID technology is not required by R753, but IATA recommends that its members use it because it is more effective than bar code technology. RFID scanning is listed as one of the acceptable methods for recording and tracking bag data in the IATA Resolution 753/A4A Resolution 30.53 Implementation Guide, available on the IATA website. The other technologies deemed acceptable for baggage tracking include laser scanning, manual recording, optical character recognition (OCR), and other technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or GPS, according to the guide.
