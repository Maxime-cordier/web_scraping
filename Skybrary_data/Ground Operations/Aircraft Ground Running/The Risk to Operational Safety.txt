The risks which may arise from engine ground running relate to the potential for loss of control of the aircraft by those persons occupying the pilot seats in the flight deck. In most cases, such persons will be maintenance personnel holding specific company-issued approval for the required tasks. The consequences of loss of control during taxi or towing are the same as apply to these operations generally and this article is concerned only with the risks arising from the static running of one or more aircraft engines. Unwanted consequences from such static running are mainly related to those arising from the unintended movement of the aircraft during engine running - effectively a loss of control - especially during high power engine running. Damage can occur to the aircraft itself, other aircraft nearby or to airside structures. In addition, there is a risk of injury to ground support personnel who may be in relatively close proximity to the aircraft.
