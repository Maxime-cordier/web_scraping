It is essential that an airside vehicle driver remains positively aware of their location at all times.. If position uncertainty occurs, STOP at once and seek assistance from ATC.. Be especially careful at night or when Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) are in force.. Monitor ATC instructions to other vehicles and aircraft and mentally ‘position’ them relative to the actual and projected position of your vehicle.. Focus 100% on the driving and navigation task; if a colleague is in the driving compartment of the vehicle with you, involve them in tracking vehicle position - but do not devolve that responsibility to them.. If about to cross a runway having obtained an ATC clearance to do so, always carry out a visual inspection in both potential directions of the full length of the runway, and up the approach paths if visible, to ensure that no aircraft or other vehicles which might conflict with the received crossing clearance are visible.. Make full use of all aerodrome surface markings, signs and lights to aid situational awareness..
