Be aware of the extent of the airside area which requires prior ATC clearance to proceed.. If there is more than one ATC designated for control of airside vehicle movements, including active runway crossings, ensure each of their control areas is understood so that frequency changes on expected or likely routes can be anticipated.. Note promulgated speed limits and any variation of these in different airside areas.. Check for any temporary restrictions and changes in the extent of the authorised movement area.. Review any issues which might arise because of reduced forward visibility or frozen surface deposits.. Have a current aerodrome chart which shows all taxiway and runway designations available in any vehicle being driven.. Consider expected routes in advance of a request for clearance to destination, taking particular note of runways which may be in use and in proximity to or likely to be encountered on these routes.. Re-check that you are familiar with the meaning of light signals which may be used by ATC if radio communications cannot be maintained.. Satisfy yourself, either before setting off or immediately as you do, that the vehicle being driven appears to be serviceable and that adequate forward visibility through the windscreen is available..
