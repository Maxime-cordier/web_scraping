Although there is some disparity among the Member States in the designation of the RFFS capacity of a given aerodrome, the basic premise for determining the normally-declared RFFS requirement is the size of the largest aircraft that it is intended to accept. In most cases, the size determination is based on both the length of the aircraft and the maximum fuselage diameter. As an example, the following chart has been extracted from the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARS). Aircraft Category for Fire Fighting: Aircraft Overall Length: Aircraft Maximum Fuselage Width: 1. < 9 m. 2 m. 2. 9 m ≤ length < 12 m. 2 m. 3. 12 m ≤ length < 18 m. 3 m. 4. 18 m ≤ length < 24 m. 4 m. 5. 24 m ≤ length < 28 m. 4 m. 6. 28 m ≤ length < 39 m. 5 m. 7. 39 m ≤ length < 49 m. 5 m. 8. 49 m ≤ length < 61 m. 7 m. 9. 61 m ≤ length < 76 m. 7 m. 10. ≥ 76 m. 8 m. To meet the requirements of the Aircraft Category for Fire Fighting, it is necessary for the aerodrome to have a declared minimum fire fighting capacity measured on the basis of the number of available vehicles and their foam production capability. In this respect, the declared Category is that actually available at the time of an aircraft approach, which may temporarily be lower than the Category normally available and so promulgated in official reference publications. When the Category actually declared is less in this way, NOTAM action and, when appropriate, tactical alerting action by ATC is necessary. As an example only, the corresponding requirements from the Canadian Regulations are as follows: Critical Category for Fire Fighting: Quantity of Water: Quantity of Complementary Extinguishing Agents: Minimum Number of Aircraft Fire-fighting Vehicles: Total Discharge Capacity: 1. 230 l. 45 kg. 1. 230 l/min. 2. 670 l. 90 kg. 1. 550 l/min. 3. 1200 l. 135 kg. 1. 900 l/min. 4. 2400 l. 135 kg. 1. 1800 l/min. 5. 5400 l. 180 kg. 1. 3000 l/min. 6. 7900 l. 225 kg. 2. 4000 l/min. 7. 12100 l. 225 kg. 2. 5300 l/min. 8. 18200 l. 450 kg. 3. 7200 l/min. 9. 24300 l. 450 kg. 3. 9000 l/min. 10. 32300 l. 450 kg. 3. 11200 l/min.
