Precipitation, freezing fog or blowing snow can all result in engine inlet, compressor core or fan contamination and/or icing. This contamination can occur prior to engine start or during arrival and departure ground operations with engines running. If present during the preflight inspection, engine ice or contamination must be removed prior to engine start. Should engine core or fan ice be suspected after engines are started, the engine manufacturer's procedures for removal must be carried out prior to takeoff. Pilots must be ready to make the necessary performance corrections if the aircraft flight manual permits takeoff with engine anti-ice ON. In the case of older engine types considered vulnerable to excessive fan icing during descent, at low thrust settings in moderate or worse icing conditions, ice shedding procedures may be specified for inflight use. If the aircraft flight manual permits it and engine anti-ice is switched ON in flight after an ice build-up has occurred (or is suspected) it is sensible not to select engine anti-ice to ON on all engines at the same time.
