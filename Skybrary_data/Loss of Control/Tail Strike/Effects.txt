Any tail strike can cause substantial damage to the aft fuselage of the aircraft which can be time consuming and expensive to repair. Beyond the cost of the repair itself, further expense will be incurred as a result of schedule disruption and the loss of the aircraft for the duration of the repair interval. A tail strike on landing tends to cause more serious damage than the same event during takeoff. In the worst case, the tail can strike the runway before the landing gear touches down, thus absorbing large amounts of energy for which it is not designed. The aft pressure bulkhead is often damaged as a result. There are several documented cases where improperly repaired tail strike damage has resulted in a catastrophic failure at a later point in time. In the case of Boeing 747 accident, an improperly repaired pressure bulkhead, that had been damaged by a tail strike, lead to the in-flight loss of the vertical stabiliser and subsequent crash of the aircraft seven years later.
