The vestibular organs are part of the human body’s mechanism for achieving posture and stability. Changes in linear acceleration, angular acceleration and vertical acceleration (gravity) which occur as a result of flight control inputs, made to accomplish a change in the flight path, are detected by the vestibular system and may create either or both of these illusions. Either illusion may arise in one of three ways In the presence of an imperceptibly slow change in motion - in the case of roll at a rate of less than approximately 2° per second. After sustained - 10 to 20 seconds - acceleration in any one direction, it may be perceived that the acceleration has stopped.. When sensory stimulation from the angular motion of the head and of the aircraft occur simultaneously in two different planes - for example interrupting looking ahead to look up to an overhead panel whilst the aircraft is also in angular motion.. Both somatogravic and somatogyral illusions are most likely occur in conditions of marginal external visual reference or in visual ‘dark night’ conditions.
