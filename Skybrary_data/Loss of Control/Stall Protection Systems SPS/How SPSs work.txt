SPSs limit the actual aircraft AoA to a specific AoA. This is achieved by a "pusher system" (stick pusher) to forcibly reduce the angle of attack and prevent a stall. SPSs normally consist of at least two independent computers with two or more independent AoA sensors. Both computers must issue stall warnings, and both have to agree to push. Normally, the pilot is required to test the operation before every flight as it is preferrable to have SPSs that fail safe— with no push— than SPSs that push inadvertently. A dual-channel SPS computer monitors the following inputs: Angle of attack (AoA) - LH, RH angle of attack vanes;. Lateral acceleration = internal reference system (IRS);. Flap position; and. Pressure altitude - air data computers (ADCs). The SPS uses these inputs to continuously calculate AoA trip points while in flight. The AoA trip points are biased with the lateral accelerometers (sideslip and skid), flap position and pressure altitude. SPSs allow pilots to extract maximum performance from the aircraft for any given set of flight conditions, without the risk of stalling or remaining in a high drag state for a prolonged period of time. The maximum AoA command may be scheduled as a function of aircraft configuration, aircraft icing state, flight conditions and other relevant parameters. The maximum AoA command cannot be readily overridden by the flight crew through inadvertent or habitual, reflexive action.
