A partly-full cabin with passengers distributed differently to the load and trim sheet presented to the aircraft commander - a particular possibility when departing from an intermediate stop on a multi-stop flight.. Total number of passengers on board substantially different to the number recorded on the load and trim sheet and the discrepancy not detected by cabin crew head counting.. Where there are financial disincentives to check baggage into the hold, there is a risk that excessive cabin baggage will be brought on board. This can be controlled by strict regulation of permitted size, weight and number of items but if this does not occur, overloading of overhead locker in respect of capacity or placarded maximum weight may occur..
