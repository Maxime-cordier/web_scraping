A failure to promptly recognise and respond to erroneous flight instrument indications can result in loss of control. A simultaneous effect of the primary problem on a Fly-By-Wire aircraft may be the reversion to Flight Control Laws (or Modes) which provide less Flight Envelope Protection than the Normal Law / Mode. The autopilot may also disconnect as a consequence of the fault. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the Air Data systems, Autopilot (AP) and Flight Director (FD) systems and individual AP/FD channels on the specific aircraft type is essential if such a situation is to be managed safely. With knowledge of pitot static systems and an understanding of the types of erroneous indications that can occur, pilots can identify that there is a problem and follow procedures to establish and maintain the aircraft in a safe condition by reference to remaining reliable information, in particular by reference to the aircraft attitude in relation to the thrust setting and altitude as verified from at least two similar displays from independent data sources.
