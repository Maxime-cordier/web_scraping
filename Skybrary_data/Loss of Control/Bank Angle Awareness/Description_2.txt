alert pilots to abnormal bank angle. This comes as an option with various forms of TAWS as an inclusion in GPWS Mode 6. As a result of TAWS becoming ICAO-mandated equipment, most multi crew aircraft operated have the ‘enhanced Mode 6’ option of ‘Bank Angle Alert’. If linked with other GPWS Modes this may come with the usual cut off above 2500 feet agl (and below 30 feet agl). The Alert call is activated at a bank angle which increases with height in this range - at 10 degrees bank angle at 30 feet agl increasing linearly with increasing height to trigger at 40 degrees at 150 feet and then remaining at 40 degrees at greater heights. There is also a version of TAWS equipment available which provides bank angle alerting at heights above 2500 ft agl without limit and aircraft fitted with this have an important additional protection for the cruise where many documented losses of control en route have begun.
