During the early stages of the takeoff roll and well below Vmcg, the right engine suffered a catastrophic failure. The pilot countered the yaw with full left rudder input but did not immediately retard the throttle of the left engine. The aircraft left the runway and was substantially damaged - the pilot was able to get out of the aircraft with minor injuries.. Shortly after becoming airborne, the right engine failed. The pilot wrongly applied full right rudder resulting in loss of directional control. The aircraft entered a spin and crashed. All on board suffered fatal injuries.. Shortly after becoming airborne, the left engine failed. The pilot correctly applied full right rudder to counter the yaw and banked approximately 5 degrees towards the live engine to counter adverse roll and was able to maintain directional control. However, the landing gear was not retracted and the pilot failed to lower the nose of the aircraft to compensate for the loss of power. The airspeed decayed and the aircraft stalled and crashed. The pilot and both passengers suffered fatal injuries..
