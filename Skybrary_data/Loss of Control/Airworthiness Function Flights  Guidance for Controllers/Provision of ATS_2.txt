crew may not be able to maintain level flight and the requirement for an emergency descent is also possible. These factors might lead to airspace infringement. If it is necessary to perform a flight or a part of it above such areas, the crew should be informed about the nature of the area (danger, prohibited, etc.) and its lateral and vertical limits. If applicable, the airspace user should be notified about the flight and appropriate coordination and other potential actions should be considered (e.g. temporary interruption of the activity in the danger/restricted area in case of an emergency descent).. Conducting an airworthiness function flight within a temporary restricted (TRA) or a temporary segregated area (TSA) does not generally demand much of the controllerâ€™s attention. Nevertheless, there are some issues to be considered: The risk of an emergency remains higher the risks associated to normal operations; Extra attention should be paid to flights below the TSA/TRA lower limit, as the airworthiness function flight might unexpectedly descend, leaving the reserved airspace..
