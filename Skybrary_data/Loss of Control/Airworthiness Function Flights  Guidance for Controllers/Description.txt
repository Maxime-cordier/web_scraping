This article addresses airworthiness function flights from the controller’s point of view. It is intended to give background knowledge about the specifics, expected crew and aircraft behaviour and to outline best practices for providing air traffic service (ATS) to such flights. The guidance provided shall not take precedence over applicable local procedures. It must be remembered that an airworthiness function flight is a non-routine activity (e.g. higher risk of incident, non-standard behaviour, etc.) and, as such, requires special consideration of the associated risks. The controller’s interference (issuing instructions and clearances, requesting reports, etc.) should be kept to a reasonable minimum to allow the crew to conduct their tasks properly. This is not a higher priority flight, however, and it is not supposed to disturb normal traffic flow. Therefore, proper coordination and timely dissemination of relevant information to concerned parties is essential for its safe and successful completion.
