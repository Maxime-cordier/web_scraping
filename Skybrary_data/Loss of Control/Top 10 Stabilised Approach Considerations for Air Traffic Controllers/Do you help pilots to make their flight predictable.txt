1. Delayed descent instructions or significant shortcuts may result in pilots requesting additional distance or contribute to high energy unstabilised approaches. read more... 2. The crew typically conducts the approach briefing before reaching top-of descent. Changing runway, especially when reducing the distance to fly, induces significant crew workload. read more... 3. Non-precision approach implies higher crew workload and less possibility for deceleration during the final approach compared with an ILS approach. Controllers should aim to position the aircraft on final at a greater distance from touchdown. read more... 4. Flight crew uncertainty about distance to touchdown affects the optimal profile management and can result in aircraft being high and fast on final approach. read more...
