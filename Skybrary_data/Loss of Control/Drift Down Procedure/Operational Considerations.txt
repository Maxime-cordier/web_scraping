If at the time of engine failure, the aircraft is above the OEI service ceiling, a descent will be required. Prevailing circumstances such as terrain, ATC requirements or if following an organised track system will dictate whether that descent needs to be a) the shallowest possible profile (drift down), b) delayed or c) can be carried out using normal economy speeds. Liaison with ATC will be required. It may be necessary to declare an emergency to ensure that ATC permit the required flight profile. 1) Maximum Performance (shallowest profile for terrain avoidance) Required This will need accurate handling of the auto-flight system. To achieve best performance, it is important that the aircraft manufacturer’s/ operator’s procedures are well understood and carefully followed. In particular the indications of and required selections on any FMS/ FMGS fitted to the aircraft need to be well understood to make the aircraft follow the best Engine Out Speed with Max Continuous Power set. 2) Delayed Descent Required If the descent needs to be delayed due to traffic, ATC or organised track turn back requirements, once Maximum Continuous Power is applied descent can be delayed by allowing the speed to reduce below command speed, but no lower than the flaps up manoeuvring speed, before commencing descent. Once again a clear understanding of how to make the required selections on the FMS/ FMGS will be needed. ATC procedures and collision avoidance may dictate the direction of initial descent, particularly on oceanic tracks and when communication is either degraded (HF only) or not available. In this situation, fuel and time factors may require that a faster descent is made to below the restriction so that the aircraft can be turned towards the alternate airfield. 3) Terrain or delayed descent not a factor In this case maximum performance is not needed and the aircraft can be flown using OEI and normal company speeds/ normal VNAV descent as required.
