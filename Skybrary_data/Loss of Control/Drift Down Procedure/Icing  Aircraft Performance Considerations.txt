Only engine icing is considered in fuel planning, but airframe icing will adversely affect aircraft performance aerodynamically and by adding weight. Moreover, with one engine out, wing de-icing could be asymmetric. If the OEI descent involves either descent through an icing layer or stabilisation within the layer, the Commander should consider increasing descent speed to minimise the time spent within the layer and, if necessary, establishing a lower single engine cruise altitude that is below the icing layer. Where the icing layer extends below Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA), this should have been considered before the flight at the planning stage. The availability of oxygen escape routes may be helpful for such decision-making. Smaller twin-engined aircraft with less excess power and operating at lower altitudes are likely to need to consider MSA, icing and escape routes on a more regular basis. NOTE: In this context MSA is used generically and the Operator may provide guidance on the use of Grid MORA and minimum altitudes on an escape chart. As well as icing, other factors can prevent an aircraft from meeting the performance published in the manuals and aircraft age, servicing and an incorrect ZFW may contribute to a lower drift down altitude and single pressurisation pack performance may not be able to maintain the required cabin altitude. These factors could also influence the outcome of the crewâ€™s decision-making process.
