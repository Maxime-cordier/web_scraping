as in the case of the Boeing 787, review the systems concerned so that they clearly alert the crew for as long as the calculation of the minimum take-off speeds (V1min, VRmin, V2min) and the associated protection are not available. [FRAN 2018-021]. that the EASA, in the scope of an update of its impact assessment, assess the safety benefit of TOPMS-type systems, taking into account in particular of existing systems (Airbus TOM). [FRAN 2018-022]. that the EASA, in the scope of an update of its impact assessment, assess the safety benefit of gross error detection/warning systems, taking into account in particular existing systems (Airbus TOS, Boeing FMS/EFB messages and protections, Lufthansa Systems LINTOP, etc.). [FRAN 2018-023]. that the EASA in coordination with the FAA, encourage manufacturers to develop, for commercial aeroplanes which are the most prevalent and the most exposed to this risk, systems adapted to the characteristics of each aeroplane family, providing increased protection against the use of erroneous parameters at take-off. [FRAN 2018-024]. that the EASA inform European national aviation authorities and operators about systems which exist or which are being developed for each aeroplane family which are likely to provide increased protection against the use of erroneous parameters at take-off. [FRAN 2018-025]. The Final Report was published in English translation on 25 January 2019 after the initial and definitive publication in French on 21 December 2018.
