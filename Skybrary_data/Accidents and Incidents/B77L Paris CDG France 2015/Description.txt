On 22 May 2015, a Boeing 777F (F-GUOC) being operated by Air France on a scheduled cargo flight (4U9525) from Paris CDG to Mexico City with an augmented crew commenced a daylight takeoff on runway 26R with thrust set for a takeoff weight of 243 tonnes instead of the actual weight of 343 tonnes. Automatic activation of the tail strike protection system during rotation was followed after no response from the operating crew by a call of "TO/GA" from one of the augmenting crew and the aircraft becoming airborne just before the end of the runway with an eventual resumption of a normal climb.
