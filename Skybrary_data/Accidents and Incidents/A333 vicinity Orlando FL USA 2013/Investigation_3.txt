of considering an appropriate modification to Trent 700 engines but they were unable to give an indicative timescale for resolution. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Rolls-Royce plc modify the oil pressure indication and failure detection systems of the Trent 700 engine to minimise the possibility of an activation of the Electronic Engine Controller oil pump failure logic as a result of high vibration or an Integrated Drive Generator failure. [2013-15]. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 12 September 2013.
