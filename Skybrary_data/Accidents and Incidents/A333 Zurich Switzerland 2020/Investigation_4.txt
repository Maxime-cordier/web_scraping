A330-300 which was also considered to have been “among other things, a consequence of the selected configuration and the dynamics of the rotation rate” and had also gone undetected by the flight crew and been followed by completion of the planned flight in an un-airworthy aircraft. Four Contributory Factors to the tailstrike were identified as follows: Because of forecast windshear during the climb, the flight crew selected a configuration generating low resistance (CONF 1+F) for takeoff;. Because of the reported fluctuation in the surface wind, the flight crew selected a tailwind component so as to incorporate a safety margin in the takeoff calculation instead of using the actual headwind. This resulted in a significantly lower rotation speed VR;. The takeoff was made with reduced engine thrust, which reduced the rate at which the speed increased during the takeoff roll and especially so during the rotation phase.. When the aircraft was rotated, windshear resulted in a decrease in the indicated airspeed to below the rotation speed VR.. The Final Report was approved on 18 October 2021 and subsequently published on 26 November 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
