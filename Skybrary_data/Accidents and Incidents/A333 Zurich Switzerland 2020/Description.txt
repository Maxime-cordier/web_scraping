On 26 February 2020, an Airbus A330-300 (HB-JHC) being operated by Swiss International Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Zurich to Nairobi and then on to Dar es Salaam as LX294 became airborne in day VMC at an excessive pitch attitude and the occurrence of a tail strike was not recognised by either the flight or cabin crew or by ATC. The flight to Nairobi was therefore completed but on arrival, the station engineer there advised the Captain that the rear fuselage showed evidence of a tailstrike which rendered the aircraft un-airworthy. It was therefore withdrawn from service and the leg to Dar es Salaam was cancelled. After consultation with Airbus, a temporary repair was eventually approved and completed 12 days later.
