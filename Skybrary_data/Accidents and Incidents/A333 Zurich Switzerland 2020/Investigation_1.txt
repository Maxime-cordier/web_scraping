A Serious Incident Investigation was carried out by the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board (STSB). Relevant data from the DFDR was downloaded but relevant data on the CVR had been overwritten. It was noted that the Captain, (a Swiss citizen born 1964) had a total of 14,931 hours total flying experience which included 3,933 hours on type and the First Officer (a German citizen born 1988) who was acting as PF for departure, had a total of 3,889 hours flying experience which included 429 hours on type. Shortly after the Scheduled Time of Departure (STD) for the flight, the crew contacted the Clearance Delivery frequency to obtain a SID and, after being offered but declined a takeoff from the takeoff runway in use, 28, (the surface wind was westerly) they were give an Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) of STD +35 minutes for runway 16. However due to intended clearance of wet snow from both runway 16 and runway 28 and aircraft ground de-icing because of continuing snow showers at the airport it was announced that runway 32 would become the takeoff runway and a new SID was obtained. The crew then performed a takeoff performance calculation on their EFB which output a CONF 2 takeoff using a reduced thrust (flex temperature-based) setting. On repeating this calculation 20 minutes later based on the new ATIS surface wind of 280° /19 - 32 knots and with windshear being reported at an altitude of approximately 3000 feet QNH (equivalent to 1500 feet aal), it was decided to change to a CONF 1+F takeoff and, in view of the variable wind and the reported runway condition (10% covered with 3mm of slush), to input a 6 knot tailwind and reduce the flex temperature from the maximum possible 35°C to 34 °C. They also decided to takeoff with the engine and wing anti-icing on and the air conditioning packs off. This produced a V1 of 136 KIAS, a VR of 148 KIAS and a V2 of 153 KIAS. Takeoff clearance was eventually given with a spot wind from 260° at 19-28 knots and it commenced at STD+01:41 hours. Rotation with the control column pulled back to about ¾ of full travel was initiated at VR (148 KIAS) but the airspeed then dropped to 142 KIAS and the PF responded by returning it to about half of full travel which, taken together, resulted in the aircraft attaining a pitch angle of 11.2° within 4 seconds. Two seconds later, at a pitch angle of 13.7° and a speed of 154 KIAS as the main gear was about to lift off, the rear lower fuselage contacted the runway without either the pilots or the rear-stationed cabin crew noticing anything unusual. The flight thereafter was completed as planned without further event. The Investigation was sought to establish exactly what happened and how this related to the flight crews’ compliance or otherwise with the relevant SOPs. It was noted at the outset that in 2013, an Airbus A330-300 being
