to expressly require “the direction and degree of any turns” to be taken into consideration. The Cause of the collision was found to be “the failure of the aircraft to follow the guide line for this aircraft type to taxi out of the parking stand”. Three Contributory Factors were also identified: the decision to use only one engine for the manoeuvre and. the decision to use the engine (which was) on the inside of the turn. the lack of coordination between the Company’s handling personnel and the crew.. The Final Report of the Investigation was approved on 27 September 2017 and subsequently made available in English language translation. In view of the action by AENA to require all aircraft to be pushed back out of stand 29, it was deemed unnecessary to issue any Safety Recommendations. It was, however, noted that whilst this action was “viewed favourably”, the lack of a pushback requirement for the A319 involved was “not regarded as the primary cause” of the investigated event.
