On 19 June 2016, an Airbus A319 (G-EZGE) being operated by Easy Jet on an international passenger flight from Ibiza to London Stansted collided with the airbridge which had previously boarded its passengers whilst beginning the self-positioning from its gate at Ibiza at night in good visibility and dry conditions. One member of the cabin crew fell over and sustained a minor injury and minor damage was caused to both the airbridge and the aircraft right wing tip and outboard slat.
