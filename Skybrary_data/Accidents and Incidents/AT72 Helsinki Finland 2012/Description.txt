On 19 August 2012, an ATR 72-200 (OH-ATH) being operated by Flybe Finland on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Tampere to Helsinki under callsign FCM992T departed the right hand side of the 60 metre-wide runway 22L after a daylight touchdown in benign weather conditions. Damage to the aircraft was only minor and it subsequently regained the runway without impacting any ground installations with none of the 31 occupants sustaining any injuries.
