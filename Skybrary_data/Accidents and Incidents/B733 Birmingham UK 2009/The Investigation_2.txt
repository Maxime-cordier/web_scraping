via the longest route and led to the aircraft being at the back of the queue on arrival there. The takeoff then commenced just inside the revised holdover time and the Captain stated that he was “very aware of this situation at the point at which the decision was made to reject”. He also reported being acutely aware of snow and potential ice accretion in relation to his assessment of available hold over time. Consequently, when the First Officer said he could not rotate the aircraft, the Captain quickly made the decision to reject the takeoff having judged there was sufficient runway remaining to do so and believing the aircraft was not capable of flying. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 9 July 2009. No Safety Recommendations were made.
