On 1 April 2011, a Boeing 737-300 being operated by Southwest Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Phoenix to Sacramento was climbing through FL 340 in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when sudden depressurisation occurred. An emergency was declared, an emergency descent actioned and an off track diversion was successfully completed to Yuma where it was discovered that the crown of the fuselage at mid cabin had ruptured leaving a hole approximately 1.5metres long by 0.2 metres across. There were no injuries except to one of the cabin crew who failed to get onto oxygen before becoming temporarily unconscious and sustaining minor impact injuries during their subsequent fall and an off duty company employee who tried to assist him and who suffered in the same way.
