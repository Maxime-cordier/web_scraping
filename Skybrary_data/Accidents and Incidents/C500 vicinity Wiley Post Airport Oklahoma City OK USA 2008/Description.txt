On 4 August 2008, a Cessna 500 (N113SH) with the appearance of being operated by InterState Helicopters on a business charter flight from Wiley Post, Oklahoma City to Mankato MN encountered a big flock of very large birds in day VMC shortly after take-off and impacted some of them. Wing impact damage to the left wing led to immediate loss of control and terrain impact some 4 miles south of the departure airport. The aircraft was destroyed by terrain impact forces and the effects of a post crash fire, and all 5 occupants were killed.
