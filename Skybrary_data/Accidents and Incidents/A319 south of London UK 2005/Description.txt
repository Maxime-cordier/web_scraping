On 22 October 2005, an Airbus A319-100 being operated by British Airways on a passenger flight from London Heathrow to Budapest experienced the sudden onset of a major electrical failure when passing FL200 in night Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). The crew recovered the situation sufficiently to decide, after consulting Company Maintenance Control, that it was appropriate to continue to their intended destination. ATC were not informed of the situation encountered. The action taken by the crew after the flight in respect of the failure was ineffective and the Operator remained unaware of the safety and airworthiness significance of it. As a result, the proper reporting action was not taken, thus delaying the start of an Investigation.
