On 12 January 2006, a Boeing 747-200F being operated by Air China on a cargo flight from Beijing to Frankfurt made a night landing on runway 07R at destination and then taxiied in normal ground visibility across runway 07L in front of an Aer Lingus Airbus A320-200 which was landing after operating a scheduled passenger flight from Dublin. The landing aircraft increased braking upon sighting the 747, which had completed its crossing of the runway before the A320 reached its crossing point.
