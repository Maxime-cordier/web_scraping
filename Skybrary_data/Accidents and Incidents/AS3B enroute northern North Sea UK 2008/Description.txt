On 22 February 2008, a Eurocopter AS332 L2 Super Puma being operated on a day passenger flight from the Bruce Offshore Oil Platform to Aberdeen was transiting a squall line in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) at the cruise altitude of 2000 feet when it was struck by lightning. There was no loss of systems or indication of any other adverse effect and the flight was completed as planned with no subsequent consequences for the operation of the helicopter or its 17 occupants. Significant main rotor blade damage was found during post flight inspection.
