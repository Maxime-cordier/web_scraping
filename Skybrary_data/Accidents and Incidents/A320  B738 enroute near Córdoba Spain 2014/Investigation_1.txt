After a significant delay in notification of the occurrence, an Investigation was carried out by the Spanish Civil Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC). Due to the lack of timely notification, no flight recorder data was available. However, OFDM data from both aircraft operators and ATC radar recordings were available although the ATC system did not have either contemporaneous or archive access to Mode S downlink data. It was noted that the A320 involved was equipped with TCAS v 7.0 software and that the series of activations of it during the occurrence included one which had been modified by the latest software version (v7.1) because of evidence that, depending on the method of presentation, it could increase the chances of pilots taking action contrary to that annunciated. The A320 Captain was a 43 year-old Spanish national who had 7,254 hours total flying experience which included 5,957 hours on type. The 29 year-old First Officer was also a Spanish national and had 3,550 hours total flying experience which included 1,572 hours on type. The 737 Captain was a 33 year-old Dutch national who had 8,000 hours total flying experience most of which - 7,800 hours - was on type. The 737 First Officer was a 24 year-old Spanish national who had 1,716 hours total flying experience most of which - 1,500 hours - was on type. The two Controllers involved on duty at the time were Spanish native speakers: the Executive Controller had held a licence since 1989 and had been working in the sector where the investigated event took place since 2002. He had a valid Level 5 English language proficiency rating.. the Planning Controller had held a licence since 2004 and had been working in the sector where the investigated event took place since 2012. He had a valid Level 4 English language proficiency rating.. It was established that with the First Officer as PF, the A320 crew had, after initially preparing for an approach to runway 09 at their destination, Seville, requested runway 27 at Seville instead. ATC accepted the request and cleared the flight to descend first to FL 310 and then to FL250 subject to a rate of descent no greater than 2,000 fpm. This restriction was applied because the aircraft was on a trajectory which was converging with that of the 737 which was also descending, although at first more than 2,000 feet below. To ensure separation was maintained, the 737 was instructed to descend at a minimum rate of 2,000 fpm and did so. Soon after the A320 had been cleared to descend, direct routing to a waypoint appropriate to the 27 approach was given explicitly under the same rate of descent restrictions. One minute after this, the A320 crew "noticed they had to increase their descent rate to reach the ideal altitude profile" which, despite the restriction just given, they did, descending at up to 5,000 fpm. Shortly after this action, the flight was re-cleared to FL170 but this time, the controller
