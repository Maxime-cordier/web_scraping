"did not mention in his clearance that the descent rate restrictions were still in effect". However, one minute after issuing this re-clearance, the controller did advise the A320 that there was "traffic 9nm away and 2,000 feet below" which was acknowledged and after a further 45 seconds asked if the A320 crew "had increased their rate of descent" to which there was no response. As a result of the high rate of descent by the A320 and the converging tracks of the 737 and the A320, both the lateral and vertical separation between the two aircraft rapidly reduced. TCAS TAs were annunciated on the flight decks of both aircraft followed quickly by co-ordinated TCAS RAs. As the 737 passed FL 222, a 'DESCEND' RA occurred requiring at least a 2,000 fpm rate of descent which was already being sustained and was continued. As the A320 passed FL 226, an 'ADJUST VERTICAL SPEED' RA requiring a reduction of the aircraft's 3200 fpm rate of descent to not more than 1,000 fpm occurred, but instead of following it, the First Officer disconnected the AP and increased the rate of descent to 4,400 fpm. After 12 seconds, the RA changed to require a rate of descent not greater than 500 fpm which was followed by the crew disengaging both FDs. Four seconds after that, passing FL 216 and still descending at 4,400 fpm, the RA reversed to 'CLIMB' requiring at least a 1500 fpm rate of climb. Recorded data showed that in response, both pilots had simultaneously pulled back on their respective sidesticks for 10 seconds "with neither one pressing the priority button, resulting in a vertical acceleration of 2.03g". The “Dual input” alert which would normally occur was not activated because the active TCAS RA had a higher priority. After 12 seconds, the annunciated RA changed again to 'ADJUST VERTICAL SPEED' which continued for a further 12 seconds until 'CLEAR OF CONFLICT' was given after which the aircraft levelled at FL 220. At no time did the crew report to ATC that they had received a TCAS RA or a 'CLEAR OF CONFLICT' annunciation. Meanwhile, the 737 crew followed their RA and announced doing so to ATC. It was noted that during the period leading up to, during and after the conflict, all ATC communications with the 737 were conducted in English but those with the A320 were conducted in a mixture of Spanish and English. An initial ATC 'Conflict Alert Prediction' (PAC) was generated almost a minute ahead of the first A320 TCAS RA and prior to loss of the prescribed minimum radar separation distance at which time it was subsequently calculated that the A320 was descending towards the other aircraft at 4475 fpm and the distance between the two aircraft was 9.7 nm laterally and 2,800 feet vertically. After a further 55 seconds, and just one second ahead of the initial A320 TCAS RA annunciation, a 'Violation Conflict Alert' (VAC) was issued with the two aircraft now 3.8 nm laterally
