locating the accident site in the thick fog but the first appliance found the aircraft some 3 minutes later and successfully suppressed the fire with foam. Other vehicles then arrived but one had become bogged down in the soft ground after its driver forgot to engage the differential lock. The Investigation concluded that “the monitoring of this approach broke down in the latter stages and the crucial ‘decision’ call was missed, which led to the aircraft’s descent below minima.” The Report of the Investigation AAIB Bulletin: 8/2011 EW/C2010/11/02 was published on 11 August 2011. Various safety actions taken by the aircraft operator and by the Airport Authority in respect of the RFFS were noted and no Safety Recommendations were made.
