On 11 May 1996, the crew of a Douglas DC9-30 (N904VJ) being operated by ValuJet on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Miami to Atlanta reported fire on board during the climb out of Miami in day VMC. Although the climb was stopped approaching 11,000 feet and an air turnback was commenced, fire damage prevented completion of this plan and the aircraft crashed out of control in what was observed to have been a near-vertical attitude killing all 110 occupants.
