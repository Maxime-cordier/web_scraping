On 23 February 2017, a Let 410 (OK-LAZ) being operated by Van Air for an Isle of Man-based Ticket Seller called ‘Citywing’ on a scheduled passenger flight from Isle of Man to Belfast City was unable to land at its destination due to adverse wind and turbulence. It returned to the Isle of Man where, after a day ILS approach completed in VMC, the crew were observed to just manage to retain sufficient control of the aircraft to make a landing in similar extreme wind conditions, in this case with gusts to over 60 knots and with a significant crosswind component. As the aircraft attempted to taxi clear of the runway, ATC ordered the crew to ‘Hold Position’ because of a ‘direction from the Isle of Man CAA’ and the aircraft was stopped into wind. RFFS vehicles which had been on standby for the landing were then positioned around the aircraft to provide some protection from the wind pending tie down and the passengers were taken by bus to the Terminal.
