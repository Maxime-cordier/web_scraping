On 4 March 2016, the crew of an ATR ATR-72-500 (G-COBO) being operated by Aurigny Air Services on a scheduled passenger flight from Manchester to Guernsey found as they conducted their take-off and climb that an abnormal amount of nose down pitch input was continuously required to maintain the appropriate pitch attitude and a diversion to East Midlands was made without further problems, with the control problem dissipating prior to commencing the final approach there.
