On 21 November 2006, a UK-registered Eurocopter AS332 L2 being operated by Bristow Helicopters on an unscheduled passenger flight from a Dutch offshore platform K15B to Den Helder in night Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) made a controlled ditching after the crew perceived flight control difficulties which would preclude the completion of the flight. A PAN and subsequently a MAYDAY were declared. All 17 occupants were subsequently located and rescued and just one sustained a minor injury.
