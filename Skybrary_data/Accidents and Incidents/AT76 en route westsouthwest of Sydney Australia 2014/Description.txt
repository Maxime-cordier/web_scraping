On 20 February 2014, the crew of an ATR 72-600 (VH-FVR) being operated by Virgin Australia Regional Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Canberra to Sydney experienced an in-flight upset during descent in day VMC involving a pitch control disconnect and serious injury to the senior cabin attendant. Following recovery, the remainder of the flight proceeded without further event. Following flight completion, extensive damage to the aircraft was not discovered and it continued in service for a further five days before being grounded.
