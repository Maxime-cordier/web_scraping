operations, and industry groups are examining the need for changes to existing industry standards and practices of aircraft fuelling. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows: the overstress fracture of the airplane's refuelling adapter ring that resulted from the abnormal angular force applied to it. The applied angular force occurred due to the ground refueller inadequately positioning the hydrant fuel truck (in relation to the airplane), and his inattentiveness while lowering the refuelling lift platform, thus permitting the refuelling hose to become snagged and pulled at an angle. The fracture of the adapter ring during the refuelling led to the ignition of the pressurized (mist producing) spilled fuel and subsequent fire. "
