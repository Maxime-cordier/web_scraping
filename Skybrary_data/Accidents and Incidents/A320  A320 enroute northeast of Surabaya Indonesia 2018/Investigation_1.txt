An Investigation was carried out by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) - the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) using recorded ATC data. Both two-person flight crews involved held valid licences and endorsements and the approach radar controller involved had 15 years experience. Both were in the Surabaya TMA East and under radar control at a time when several inbound flights were holding at different positions. Flight CTV878 was instructed to descend to 19,000 feet QNH and enter the hold at waypoint EMARA to expect an eventual approach to runway 28. About two minutes later, this clearance was changed to descend and maintain FL200. Two minutes later, flight CTV635 made initial contact with the frequency and was instructed to maintain FL210 and join the hold at waypoint EMARA and the controller then instructed another Citilink flight (CTV661) which was also tracking towards EMARA to take up the hold to descend to FL140. Flight CTV878 then advised that it was approaching EMARA and requested confirmation that a hold (as previously cleared at FL 200) was still required but the controller responded using the callsign CTV661 affirming that it was and that FL140 should be maintained to which flight CTV878 replied advising that the request had come from CTV878. The controller then responded with confirming that CTV878 should maintain FL200 and hold at EMARA. This was read back correctly and a request as to whether a left or right hand hold was required received the response that a right hand pattern inbound on 190° was required and this was correctly read back. It was noted that the recording of this exchange did not indicate any reducing audio communication quality. Two minutes after this, flight CTV635, which was about 23 nm northwest of EMARA, advised approaching FL210 and was instructed to descend to FL200 and take up the hold on reaching. At this time, the controller was handling five aircraft including CTV878 which was maintaining FL200 in the EMARA hold. A little over a minute later, the horizontal separation between CTV878 and CTV635 had reduced below the applicable minimum of 5 nm as CTV635 reached FL200 and half a minute later, flight CTV878 queried the appearance of traffic on their right hand side and received the response “sorry, Citilink 635 immediate left turn, sorry right turn heading to descend to 180 right turn heading 250”. Flight CTV878 then reported having received a TCAS RA (to descend to FL180) and the controller responded with an instruction to “turn right and maintain FL200”. CTV878 then again advised the controller that a TCAS RA had been received and this time it was acknowledged. Both horizontal and vertical separation between CTV878 and CTV635 began to increase. Less than half a minute later, having not received any TCAS RA notification from CTV635, the controller instructed it to descend to FL180 and received a corresponding readback. He then queried whether the flight was still heading towards EMARA receiving the response that it was turning right and on heading
