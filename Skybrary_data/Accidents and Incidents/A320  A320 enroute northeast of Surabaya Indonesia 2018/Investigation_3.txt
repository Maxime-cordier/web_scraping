‘Fatigue Management Guide for Air Traffic Service Providers’. It was noted that the latter publication highlights the fact that fatigue management relies on the identification of fatigue hazards and effective safety reporting and that the issues associated with fatigue will be difficult to detect unless people are willing and able to report them. It was therefore emphasised that “it must be acceptable to raise legitimate issues about fatigue without fear of retribution or punishment either within the ANSP or any outside organisation”. The overall conclusions of the Investigation were that the radar controller involved had experienced a failure of alertness and that the other controllers present had not recognised the consequences of this with all involved appearing not to recognise the additional consequences of the temporary absence of STCA and any mitigation to address this. Safety Action taken by AirNav Indonesia as a result of the Investigation was noted as including the following: optimised the function of the Watch Supervisor to assist controller(s) especially during high workload situations.. ensured that the STCA will be provided during the provision of Air Traffic Service and mitigation put in place if STCA is temporarily unavailable.. The Final Report of the Investigation was approved for publication on 22 March 2022 and subsequently released. In view of the reported Safety Action, no Safety Recommendations were made.
