An Investigation was carried out by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB) assisted by data downloaded from the FDR but relevant data on the CVR was overwritten because the corresponding CB was not tripped after the accident. Recorded ATC data were also available. It was noted that the Captain who was acting as PF for the flight involved and had been working for the operator for 10 years and had a total of over 30,000 hours flying experience including 7,500 hours on type. He had been promoted to Captain in 2017. The First Officer had joined the operator three months prior to the accident and completed line training on type the following month. He had a total of 2,275 hours flying experience including 75 hours on type. While en route, the flight crew obtained a destination weather report and noted that the wind was from 030° 16-24 knots with the equivalent of 2000 metres visibility in light snow with the temperature -01° C and an overcast at 300 feet agl. The RNAV approaches to runway 05 and the ILS to runway 14 were available. The flight crew programmed the arrival and RNAV approach for runway 05 into the FMC and obtained a landing distance of 2,200 metres for that runway from the ACARS using flaps 30 and autobrake 3 for a VREF of 147 KIAS. Shortly afterwards, ATC issued a RSC report which indicated that the middle 50 metres of both the 61 metre-wide runways were 100% covered in a “trace of wet snow” and the remainder 100% covered in 5 cm of wet snow. Updated weather subsequently received gave a visibility reduced to 1000 metres and a cloudbase of 200 feet. Since the new cloudbase was the minimum for runway 05, the crew requested an ILS approach to the 2,350 metre-long runway 14 instead. With about 45 nm to run to the destination overhead, and descending through 13 000 feet QNH, clearance for this approach was given routing via the procedure IF located approximately 10 nm from touchdown. The crew reported that they had “mentally assessed” that the latest reported wind from 020° “would result in a crosswind for runway 14 because it was perpendicular to runway 05” and although it was much shorter than the 3,200 metres runway 05, the available 2,350 metres was more than the required landing distance already calculated. On that basis, they had not requested new ACARS performance data or revised the target approach speed. They did not recognise that the new approach would not only result in a tailwind component, but one of 15 knots which was significantly higher than the company landing limit of 10 knots. Approximately six minutes before the subsequent landing, Terminal Control instructed the flight to change to TWR and on doing so, the TWR controller advised them that the wind was from 010° at 14-23 knots and the RVR was 1220 metres. Because all recent landings had been carried out on Runway 05, no braking action reports were
