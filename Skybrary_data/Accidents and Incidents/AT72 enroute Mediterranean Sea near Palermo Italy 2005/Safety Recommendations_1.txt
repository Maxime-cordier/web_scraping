A total of eighteen Safety Recommendations were issued as a result of the Investigation, three whilst it was in progress and the remainder on completion. Two Recommendations were issued on 6 September 2005 as follows: that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) should require an ATR 72 and ATR 42 fleet inspection in order to verify the installation of the applicable Fuel Quantity Indicator.. [ANSV-6/443-05/1/A/05] that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) should consider the possibility to mandate a modification of the Fuel Quantity Indicator installation in order to prevent any incorrect fitting.. [ANSV-7/443-05/2/A/05] It was noted that on 25 October 2006, the German BFU had, as a result of their investigation into a similar confusion relating to the applicability of FQIs for the ATR 42 and ATR 72 on 18 March 2006, and having noted the rejection by European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) of the above ANSV Safety Recommendation, issued a further Safety Recommendation to EASA on that they "should arrange that the construction of one of the Fuel Quantity Indicators (FQI) of the ATR 72 or ATR 42 be changed to such a extent that they cannot be interchanged anymore.[14/2006]" On 5 December 2005, one further Recommendation was issued: that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) should consider the possibility to change the fuel system certification regulation for public transport aircraft, in order to require that the fuel low level warning be independent from the fuel gauging systems.. [ANSV-13/443-05/3/A/05] The remaining 15 Recommendations were as follows: that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), in the expectation of the eventual installation modification of the FQI, consider the possibility of: (a) requiring to operators whose fleet includes ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft to implement ad hoc maintenance procedures in order to avoid the installation of ATR 42 type FQIs on ATR 72 aircraft and vice versa; (b) requiring the creation of labels to be applied on the FQIs in order to show which aircraft type they must be installed on, ATR 42 or ATR 72.. (a) requiring to operators whose fleet includes ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft to implement ad hoc maintenance procedures in order to avoid the installation of ATR 42 type FQIs on ATR 72 aircraft and vice versa;. (b) requiring the creation of labels to be applied on the FQIs in order to show which aircraft type they must be installed on, ATR 42 or ATR 72.. [ANSV-16/443-05/4/A/07] that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) should consider the possibility of integrating information available in emergency procedures concerning the ditching, in order to consider also the possibility of ditching without both engines operating.. ANSV-17/443-05/5/A/07] that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should consider the possibility of carrying out studies aimed to define guidelines and/or issue regulatory requirements, concerning P/N assignment methods for aviation components.. [ANSV-18/443-05/6/A/07] that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should consider the possibility of carrying out studies aimed to define guidelines
