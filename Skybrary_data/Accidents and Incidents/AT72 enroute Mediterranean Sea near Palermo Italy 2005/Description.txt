On 6 August 2005, an ATR 72-210 being operated by Tunis Air subsidiary Tuninter on a scheduled passenger service from Bari, Italy to Djerba, Tunisia ditched into the sea in day VMC approximately 23nm north east of Palermo Airport after a rundown of both engines in quick succession following fuel exhaustion. The aircraft broke up on impact with the water and sixteen of the occupants were killed and sixteen, including both pilots, were seriously injured. The remaining seven sustained minor injuries.
