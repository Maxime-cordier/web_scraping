and/or issue regulatory requirements, concerning the possibility of providing suitable installation modifications on the aircraft or on the component itself, in order to avoid that components with same functions and ostensibly similar but with different performance, could be installed in error.. [ANSV-19/443-05/7/A/07] that the EASA, the FAA and the Tunisian DGAC should consider the possibility (of) all air transport operators perform(ing) a systematic check of the correspondence between P/Ns shown in the applicable Illustrated Parts Catalogue with information contained/recorded in software/databases generally used for spares management, with particular reference to components which directly influence the aircraft’s operation and safety.. [ANSV-20/443-05/8/A/07] that the EASA, the FAA, the ENAC and the Tunisian DGAC should sensitise the airlines to the importance of the safety demonstration (briefing) addressed to the passengers, emphasising the importance of carefully following the cabin crew’s instructions,especially during emergencies.. [ANSV-21/443-05/9/A/07] that the Tunisian DGAC should perform an “ad hoc” check at national airlines concerning Operation manuals compliance with applicable legislation.. [ANSV-22/443-05/10/A/07] that the Tunisian DGAC should, in cabin crew applicants’ selection procedures, provide selective criteria aimed also to check behaviour during emergency situations and subsequent conditions of potential stress.. [ANSV-23/443-05/11/A/07] that the Tunisian DGAC should consider the possibility of having joint Recurrent Training (flight crew and cabin crew) characterised by operational scenarios with characteristics similar to the event under examination (preparation for landing outside an airport/ditching, emergency evacuation of passengers, etc.).. [ANSV-24/443-05/12/A/07] that the Tunisian DGAC should integrate operational manuals available to ATR 42/72 aircraft flight crew (FCOM and QRH), including further information concerning the identification of engine flame out conditions (uncontrolled shutdown) and their management.. [ANSV-25/443-05/13/A/07] that the Tunisian DGAC should consider the possibility of introducing a flight data monitoring system, such as Flight Data Monitoring (FDM), useful as a preventive tool. It has to be pointed out that ICAO Annex 6 (provision 3.2.6) recommends (that) operators of an aeroplane of a certificated takeoff mass in excess of 20000 kg (should) establish and maintain a flight data analysis programme as part of (their) safety management system.. [ANSV-26/443-05/14/A/07] that the Tunisian DGAC should promote establishment of reporting systems which allow learning and reduction of risk conditions in technical-operational operations, both for the flight operation part and for the maintenance part.. [ANSV-27/443-05/15/A/07] that the Minister of Justice (Italy) and Minister of Transport (Italy), as applicable, should initiate the legislative initiatives necessary to ensure that the ANSV, even in case of a pending judicial authority inquiry, can have immediate and unconditional access to all elements (in primis, to information contained in aircraft’s flight recorders) necessary for the technical investigation.. [ANSV-28/443-05/16/A/07] that the Minister of Justice (Italy) and Minister of Transport (Italy), as applicable, should take necessary legislative initiatives aimed to rapidly ensure, in Italy, the rights of accredited representatives and relevant consultants of foreign accident investigation authorities appointed for technical investigations, according to provisions stated in Annex 13 of International Civil Aviation Convention (Annex 13 ICAO) also in the event of a judicial authority inquiry.. [ANSV-29/443-05/17/A/07] that the Minister of Justice (Italy)
