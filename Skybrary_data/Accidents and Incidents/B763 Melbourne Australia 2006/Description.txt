On 3 August 2006, a Boeing 767-300 being operated by Qantas on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Melbourne to Sydney encountered a large flock of birds during rotation for a dusk but still daylight normal visibility take off and sustained multiple bird strikes. Abnormal function of the left engine followed and was attributed to bird ingestion but the situation was sufficiently contained for the crew to decide to continue to Sydney rather than turn back and the remainder of the flight was, given some precautionary engine handling decisions, uneventful.
