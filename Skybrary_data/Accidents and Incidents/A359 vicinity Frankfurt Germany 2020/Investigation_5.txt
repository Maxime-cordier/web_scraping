good visual meteorological conditions unstabilised on instrument approach to runway 07R of Frankfurt/Main Airport. The glide slope of the instrument landing system was flown through from above. Starting at an altitude of 3,300 feet, the flight path was continuously below the glideslope. The flight crew discontinued the instrument approach and initiated a go around procedure about 6nm ahead of the runway 07R threshold at 668 feet agl, i.e. far below the glideslope. The investigation determined that there had been: Errors in the programming of the waypoints in the flight management system. Errors in the handling of the auto flight system for the approach. Reduced situational awareness of the pilots in regard to the spatial position. Communications and cooperation deficiencies within the flight crew.. The Final Report was completed on 7 July 2022 and published the following month. No Safety Recommendations were made.
