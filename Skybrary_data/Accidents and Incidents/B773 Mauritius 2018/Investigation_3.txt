the on-board cabin service carts by the caterers which increased cabin crew pre departure workload.. The fact that the cabin crew receipt of the usual flight preparation documentation was delayed because these documents were not available on their tablets led the crew to adapt quickly to an unexpected situation without evaluating whether it would be advisable to postpone some elements of passenger service.. The focus of the cabin crew on passenger services to the detriment of certain safety actions, due in particular to their desire to re-arrange the loading of cabin service carts to limit the impact for passengers during the flight and to provide the correct passenger service to a higher than usual number of passenger requests because business class was full.. The unusually high workload before and during boarding of the particular member of cabin crew who was responsible for securing the cabin service cart that was not properly stowed.. The failure of the cabin crew team to follow standard reporting procedures, which did not allow for a final check of the inadequately secured galley cart before take-off.. Safety Action taken by Air France as a result of the event whilst the Investigation was in progress was noted to have included but not been limited to the following: The introduction of a crosscheck on cabin configuration by the operations controller and the cabin crew manager.. The automation of the aircraft configuration management system.. Documentation relating to all possible aircraft configurations is now available to cabin crew on their tablets.. The Final Report was published in English translation on 19 June 2020 following the initial and definitive publication in French on 29 May 2020. No Safety Recommendations were made.
