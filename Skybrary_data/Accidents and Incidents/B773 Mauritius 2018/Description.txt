On 16 September 2018, a Boeing 777-300 (F-GSQL) being operated by Air France on a scheduled international passenger flight from Mauritius to Paris CDG as AF463 was beginning its takeoff when an unsecured cabin service cart left its forward galley stowage and travelled almost the full length of the cabin before being stopped by impact with an unoccupied passenger seat. Eight passengers were injured, one seriously. Once airborne, an assessment of the seriously injured passenger was made and it was decided that their condition was such that the flight continuing to Paris as planned would be the best option.
