On 14 November 2016, an ATR72-600 (OY-JZC) was being operated by Jet Time for SAS on a domestic passenger flight from Bergen to Trondheim via Ã…lesund as SAS 4144. During the first leg of the flight, the crew continued climbing in day IMC after encountering severe icing conditions and temporarily lost control of the aircraft before achieving a recovery and completing the remainder of the flight. No passenger injuries were sustained but there was widespread alarm amongst the passengers during the loss of control.
