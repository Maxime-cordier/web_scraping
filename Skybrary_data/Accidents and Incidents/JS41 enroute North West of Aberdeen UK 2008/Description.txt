On 9 April 2008, an Eastern Airways BAe Jetstream 41 operating a passenger charter flight departed Aberdeen for Vagar, Faroe Islands in snow and freezing conditions, but had not been de-iced and anti-iced appropriately. After takeoff the flight proceeded uneventfully until the autopilot pitch trim warning illuminated during the climb in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The crew concluded that the elevator had become jammed because of ice. A MAYDAY call was made to ATC, stating that the crew were having problems with the elevator controls and that they did not have full control of the aircraft in pitch. The crew then used changes in power and higher forces on the elevator controls to gain sufficient control to descend into warmer air, where the ice melted. The aircraft then completed a diversion to Wick without further problems.
