The key recommendations are listed below. Provide specific guidance and proper engineering support to Principal Maintenance Inspectors (FSDO) to evaluate modifications of airline maintenance programs and operations specifications that propose segmenting major maintenance inspections.. Revise the regulations governing the certification of aviation maintenance technician schools and the licensing of airframe and power plant mechanics to require that the curriculum and testing requirements include modern aviation industry technology.. Require operators to provide specific training programs for maintenance and inspection personnel about the conditions under which visual inspections must be conducted. Require operators to periodically test personnel on their ability to detect the defined defects.. Revise the National Aviation Safety Inspection Program objectives to require that inspectors evaluate not only the paperwork trail, but also the actual condition of the fleet airplanes undergoing maintenance and on the operation ramp..
