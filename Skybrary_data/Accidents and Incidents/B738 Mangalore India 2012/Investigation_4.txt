In particular, the provision of a transmissometer (as part of) the Automatic Weather Observation System (AWOS) should be considered, so that instantaneous RVR values are available when visibility drops, and the Class 3 status of the Meteorological Office at Mangalore should be upgraded so that TREND forecasts are issued around the clock.. that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) should consider the installation of runway centreline lights at Mangalore in view of the table top operation, surrounding topography and frequently changing weather phenomena.. that Mangalore Airport should take action to make the Airport Runway Safety Team more active and effective..
