On 23 January 2013, radio contact was lost with a DHC6-300 (C-GKBC) being operated by Kenn Borek Air on a day non revenue positioning flight from South Pole Station to Terra Nova Bay under Visual Flight Rules (VFR). After a search and rescue effort based on transmissions from the ELT, the aircraft was subsequently found to have crashed whilst en route in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) resulting in the three occupants being killed.
