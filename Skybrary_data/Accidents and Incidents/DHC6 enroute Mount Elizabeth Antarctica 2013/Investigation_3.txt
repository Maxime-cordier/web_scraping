company did not have a practice in place to verify the functionality of the CVR prior to flight.. The rate of climb recorded in the SkyTrac ISAT-100 tracking equipment prior to contacting terrain was consistent with the performance figures in the DHC-6 Twin Otter Series 300 Operating Data Manual 1-63-1, Revision 7.. Safety Action taken as a result of the accident findings by Kenn Borek Air was recorded as follows: flight-following in the Antarctic has been taken back 'in-house' from a contractor "so as to maintain greater operational control". GPS standard operating procedures have been amended to prevent incorrect data input. "the accuracy of aviation navigational charts in the Antarctic has been improved" and standard VFR routes for flights exceeding 400 nm have been introduced.. a GPWS/TAWS limitation awareness program for flights above the 70th parallel north and below the 70th parallel south has been introduced. the pre-start checklist has been amended so as to confirm that an adequate oxygen supply is on board the aircraft and that the cockpit voice recorder is functional. the administrative oversight of daily aircraft inspections has been "improved". The Final Report was authorised for release by the Board on 21 May 2014 and officially released on 20 June 2014. No Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation.
