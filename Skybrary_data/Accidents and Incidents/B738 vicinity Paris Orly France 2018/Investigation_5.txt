the reason why this defect, present since the installation of the sensor on the aeroplane, led to the activation of the alerts during a post maintenance flight. However, it is possible that the handling of the sensor during maintenance exacerbated the dysfunction without the technicians realising this.. The technician working on the aeroplane between the two flights not using the Fault Investigation Manual. Its use would have ensured that a more complete check was carried out and the failure would have probably been detected and the sensor replaced.. Safety Action taken as a result of the event whilst the Investigation was in progress was noted to have included the following: The BEA presented three ‘Safety Lessons’ arising from the Investigation as follows: The takeoff is a dynamic phase during which the crew may not have the resources to identify all the possible consequences of a failure of the speed indicator. Given the importance of the speed indications to continue the flight, a doubt as to this parameter should incite the crew to envisage rejecting the takeoff when this is still possible.. A failure of the speed indicator can affect numerous systems situated on the side of the faulty sensor, such as the autopilot, auto-throttle, flight directors or stall protection. The deactivation of the automatic systems required by the memory items of the Unreliable Airspeed procedure aims to prevent the use of the automatic systems on the side affected by the dysfunction and must be carried out by the crew before any analysis.. Transmitting a PAN PAN message in order to notify a technical issue allows the ATC to take precautionary measures if necessary and can often help reduce the crew’s workload.. The Final Report was published in both English translation and in the definitive French language version on 16 November 2020. No Safety Recommendations were made.
