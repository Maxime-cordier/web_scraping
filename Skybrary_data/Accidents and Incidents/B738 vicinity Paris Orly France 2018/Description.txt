On 7 February 2018, a Boeing 737-800 (F-GZHO) being operated by Transavia France on a post maintenance positioning flight from Norwich to Paris Orly after undergoing a ‘C’ Check experienced an airspeed mismatch during a night VMC takeoff but after the crew had identified the faulty system by reference to the standby instrumentation, the flight was completed. After the recorded defect was then signed off overnight as “no fault found”, the same thing happened on the first flight the following day, an international passenger flight from Paris Orly to Marrakesh which took off in day VMC, but this time an air turnback followed.
