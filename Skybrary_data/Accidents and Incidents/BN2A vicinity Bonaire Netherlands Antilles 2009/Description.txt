On 22 October 2009, a Britten-Nornan BN2A Islander (PJ-SUN)being operated by Divi Divi Airlines on a scheduled passenger service from Cura√ßao to Bonaire in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) experienced a failure of the right engine as it reached cruise altitude. The Pilot attempted to complete the intended flight but when altitude could not be maintained he was eventually forced to carry out a ditching within a few miles of the destination. Four of the nine passengers received minor injuries but all were able to exit the aircraft before it sank in deep water. Attempts to release the Pilot who was trapped and had been rendered unconscious by the effects of the impact were unsuccessful.
