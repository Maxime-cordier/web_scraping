If the ground staff cannot place the heavier passengers at the front of the aircraft at check-in, the pilot will explain it is better for the aircraft centre of gravity.. The remaining two Britten-Norman Islander aircraft currently being used have been checked on possible damage as a result of exceeding the maximum structural landing weight. No defects have been found..
