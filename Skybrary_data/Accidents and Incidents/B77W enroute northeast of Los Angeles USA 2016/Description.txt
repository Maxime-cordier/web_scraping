On 16 December 2016, the augmented crew of a Boeing 777-300 (B-16726) being operated by EVA Air on a scheduled international passenger flight from Los Angeles to Taipei as EVA015 received and responded to an EGPWS PULL UP Warning in night IMC whilst in receipt of radar control vectors in Class ‘B’ airspace given shortly after takeoff in a series of non standard and at times confusing instructions. After this successful recovery by the crew, the remainder of the flight to destination was completed without further event.
