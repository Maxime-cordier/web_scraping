assessment of its seriousness, appeared to be in some doubt. Not until three days after the event was an SRT conducted and concluded that the aircraft had flown “within 0.5 nm laterally, and below the published and charted altitude of a displayed obstruction”. The Probable Cause of the event was determined to be “the air traffic controller assigning the pilots a left turn instead of the required right turn after departure which placed the aircraft in an unsafe proximity with terrain and obstructions”. A Contributory Factor was identified as “the air traffic controller's inadequate recovery technique during the development of the incident”. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 7 May 2019. The associated Docket from which detail not included in the Final Report has been taken in order to prepare this summary was released online the day prior to publication of the Report. No Safety Recommendations were made.
