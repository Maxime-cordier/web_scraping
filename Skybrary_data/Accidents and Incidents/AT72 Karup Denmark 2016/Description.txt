On 25 January 2016, an ATR 72-200 (OY-LHA) being operated by an unidentified airline on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Karup to Copenhagen rejected its night take off in fog from the 2,929 metre-long runway 27L when the crew realised that they had aligned the aircraft with the right hand runway edge lights instead of the runway centreline lights. There were no injuries to the 69 occupants but minor damage was caused to the aircraft and six runway edge lights and two obstacle lights on a military arrestor cable mechanism at the side of the runway were destroyed.
