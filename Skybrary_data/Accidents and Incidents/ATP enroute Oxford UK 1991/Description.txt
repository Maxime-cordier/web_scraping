On 11 August 1991, a British Aerospace ATP being operated by British Midland Airways (BMA) on a scheduled passenger flight from East Midlands to Jersey, Channel Islands and climbing to cleared level FL160 in day IMC was unable to maintain altitude and as this level was approached and the flight crew temporarily lost control with uncontrollable roll oscillation and a high rate of descent leading to a loss of altitude of 3000 feet. A PAN was declared to ATC but as the aircraft descended below cloud, control was regained and the flight continued without further event. None of the 63 occupants were injured and the aircraft was undamaged.
