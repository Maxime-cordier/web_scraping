had to take into consideration whether an aircraft was taxiing to parking position B26 or to the A-B area.. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result if the investigation: The operator of the Frankfurt/Main Airport should ensure a spatial separation of the taxiing traffic and the vehicle traffic on the apron in the area of the crossing of taxiway G with the taxi guide line to position B26 by means of infrastructural measures (e. g. change of traffic routing). (No. 28/2009). The operator of the Frankfurt/Main airport should revise the procedure for the assignment of dispatch and parking positions published in the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) in chapter AD 2 EDDF 2.20, 3.3. Thereby making it clear that the AGNIS / PAPA system is a visual guidance system for taxiing and parking airplanes, and that its activation does not substitute the taxiing clearance into the parking position. (No. 29/2009). The Investigation was completed on 5 June 2010 and the Final Report may be seen in full at SKYbrary bookshelf: BFU Report 5X015-08
