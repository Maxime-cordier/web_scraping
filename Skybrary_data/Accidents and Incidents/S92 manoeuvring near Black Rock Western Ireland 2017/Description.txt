On 14 March 2017, a Dublin-based Sikorsky S92A (EI-ICR) being operated by CHC Ireland on behalf of the Irish Coast Guard was positioning in night IMC to assist an offshore casualty recovery operation already under way off the west coast of Ireland by providing “top cover”. The Captain was aware that en-route refuelling would be necessary and decided after takeoff that uplift at a coastal helipad at Blacksod would be appropriate. Whilst attempting to navigate to this location at low level in very poor forward visibility, a late sighting of terrain co-located with the first FMS waypoint of the intended approach was followed by unsuccessful avoiding action and a collision which led to a loss of control and the helicopter impacting the sea surface with fatal injuries sustained by all four occupants.
