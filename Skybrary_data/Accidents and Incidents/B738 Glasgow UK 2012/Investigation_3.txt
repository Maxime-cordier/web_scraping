passengers who returned their questionnaires, it was noted that the age distribution requirements for the certification test were met. It was noted that the height of the trailing edge of the flap above the ground recorded during certification of the 737 variant involved was 70 inches whereas with the inner flap lowered (as it was for this evacuation) to the prescribed 40Â°positon, the drop from the trailing edge was only 42 inches. Safety Action by the Operator subsequent to the event was reported to the Investigation to have been taken as follows: Procedures for all post-maintenance engine ground runs have been amended so that both air conditioning packs will be run using engine bleeds and with the cabin temperature selectors in the mid position for five minutes in addition to the existing Aircraft Maintenance Manual requirement for at least five minutes of engine running at idle without load.. The Passenger Safety Card content has been revised to show that passengers using the overwing exits will need to slide down the trailing edge of the wing and the content of the verbal briefing given by cabin crew to passengers occupying overwing exit seats has been amended to stress the requirement to turn aft immediately after stepping onto the wing through the exit and to then slide down the trailing edge of the wing.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 10 October 2013. No Safety Recommendations were made.
