On 7 January 2016, a Boeing 737-700 (D-ABLB) being operated by Germania on a passenger flight (GMI 6129) from Gran Canaria to Friedrichshafen in normal day visibility began take-off from runway 03R in accordance with an ATC clearance but the take-off was subsequently rejected from approximately 60 knots on ATC instructions, the controller having realised that an object was present on the runway. Prior to the event unfolding, both the controller involved and the pilots "knew that runway 03R was closed".
