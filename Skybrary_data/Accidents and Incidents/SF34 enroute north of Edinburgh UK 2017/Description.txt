On 5 June 2017, a Saab 340B (G-LNGB) being operated by Loganair on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Edinburgh to Sumburgh was climbing in day IMC when it unexpectedly encountered severe icing and turbulence and temporary loss of pitch control which was accompanied by a succession of stick shaker activations before the crew regained control as the turbulence lessened. The flight thereafter was uneventful.
