On 12 November 2001, the crew of an Airbus A300-600 (N14053) being operated by American Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from New York JFK to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic lost control of their aircraft just 1Â½ minutes after takeoff during the second of two minor wake turbulence encounters and the subsequent destruction of the aircraft by ground impact forces and a post crash fire led to all 260 occupants and five others on the ground being killed.
