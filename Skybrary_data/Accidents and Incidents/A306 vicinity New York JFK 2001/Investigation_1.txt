An Investigation into the accident was carried out by the NTSB. The FDR and CVR were recovered and their relevant data were successfully downloaded. Radar surveillance data for the departures of both the A300 and the preceding 747 were also available. A video-referenced study was undertaken to compare elapsed time information taken from available video recordings with that of the radar/CVR/FDR data and to thereby calculate the position of the aircraft after the loss of FDR and radar data. Because the CVR was powered from the emergency bus bar, it continued to record data after the engines separated from the aircraft. It was noted that the 42 year-old Captain had been employed by the airline since July 1985 and had received a type rating on the A300 in September 1988 whilst serving as a First Officer and a type rating on the Boeing 727 in December 1991. He then qualified in command on the A300 in August 1998. He had 8,050 hours total flying experience which included 1,723 hours on type in command. The 34 year-old First Officer, who was PF for the accident flight, had been employed by the airline since March 1991 and had received his A300 type rating in November 1998 after previously working on the Boeing 727. He had a total of 4,403 hours flying experience which included 1,835 hours on type. There was some evidence that the First Officer had previously demonstrated a tendency to over-control when encountering wake turbulence despite being otherwise considered generally competent by those who had flown with him. It was established that the taxi out for departure from runway 31L was in turn behind a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400. Shortly after the 747 had begun its takeoff, the TWR controller cautioned the A300 pilots about wake turbulence and instructed them to line up and hold. The A300 subsequently lifted off about 1 minute 40 seconds after the 747 and thereafter was cleared to turn left, fly the ‘Bridge’ climb and change frequency to New York TRACON. Radar data indicated that the aircraft began its climbing left turn at 500 feet and established on a track of 220º. The Captain checked in with the TRACON departure controller and advised passing 1300 feet for 5000 feet and was re-cleared to 13,000 feet. Just after a minute airborne, an instruction to the A300 to turn left and proceed direct to the WAVEY intersection was given and acknowledged. At this time, FDR data indicated that there had been a mild wake turbulence encounter which had been recognised as such by the crew. FDR data showed that there had been some movement in all the primary flight controls over a period of 5 seconds as the turn to WAVEY was made. Then, approximately 10 seconds later, with the aircraft climbing at approximately 250 knots, a second mild wake turbulence encounter occurred in response to which there were a series of much more aggressive control inputs. After an initial right rudder input, the First Officer proceeded
