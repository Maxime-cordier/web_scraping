On 23 September 2012, a Boeing 737-800 being operated by Ryanair on a scheduled passenger flight from Manchester to Memmingen commenced a day visual approach to runway 24 at Memmingen but as the aircraft turned right to regain the extended runway centreline at a continued high rate of descent, a series of Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) alerts warnings triggered by terrain proximity occurred and a go around was flown to a subsequently uneventful second approach to the same runway followed by a normal landing.
