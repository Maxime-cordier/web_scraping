As a result of the NTSB Investigation, Embraer issued three successive versions of an ASB in December 2007 advising operators to carry out a detailed pre flight inspection of the elevator system until such time as the alternative electromechanical gust lock system was installed. The FAA accepted that the interim inspections mandated by their AD had not been adequate to detect the risk of failure and therefore issued a new AD in February 2008 which largely replicated the Embraer ASB. This AD was then replaced in May 2008 by another which required repetitive inspections of mechanical gust lock systems and required their replacement with the electromechanical system within the lesser of 90 calendar days or 500 flight hours. The full NTSB Final Report of the Investigation includes the following Probable Cause, determined by NTSB on 27 June 2011 as: “The failure of the elevator control rods due to exposure to high winds while the aircraft was parked overnight.” It was also noted that “ “Contributing to this incident was the failure of the existing airworthiness directive to adequately detect this discrepancy given the known deficiency with the mechanical gust lock design.” As a result of the safety action already taken by the FAA, no Safety Recommendations were made.
