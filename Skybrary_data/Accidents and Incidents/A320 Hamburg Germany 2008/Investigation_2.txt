permitted a method of demonstrating compliance which did not take into full account the real effect of crosswinds. The values for maximum crosswind demonstrated were presented differently for different types within the Airbus family (average wind speed plus gusts, average wind speed including gusts).. Landing techniques The description of different crosswind landing techniques (crab-angle, sideslip or a combination) contained in flight operations documentation FCOM, FCTM, FCOM Bulletins and FOBN were not uniform and in part contradictory.. The crosswind landing description given in FCOM was less suitable for use in very strong crosswinds, because it could result in the aircraft drifting from the runway centreline.. There were different descriptions given in the aircraft manufacturer's flight documentation with respect to the use of rudder in crosswind conditions.. One Flight Operation Briefing Note (FOBN) issued by the aircraft manufacturer described a technique for landing in strong crosswinds that would have been suitable for the Hamburg landing in question but it was not part of the official Operations Manuals.. The description of the crosswind landing technique given in the Company Operations Manuals did not correspond fully with the one given by the aircraft manufacturer in the FCOM.. There were differences between the landing techniques described the Operations Manual volumes covering ‘Aircraft Type’ and ‘Fight Training’; under strong crosswind conditions the wings low with crabbed approach technique described in the Flight Training volume would have been more suitable and was the method taught and practised in the simulator.. Weather The weather conditions at the time of the occurrence essentially matched those of the forecast.. The wind conditions on the day of the occurrence were significant but not unusual..
