The Investigation found that “this serious landing incident took place in the presence of a significant crosswind and immediate causes are as follows: The sudden left wing down attitude was not expected by the crew during the landing and resulted in contact between the wingtip and the ground.. During the final approach to land the tower reported the crosswind as gusting up to 47 knots, and the aircraft continued the approach. In view of the maximum crosswind demonstrated for landing, a go-around would have been reasonable.”. The Investigation also found that “the following systematic causes led to this serious incident: The terminology maximum crosswind demonstrated for landing was not defined in the Operating Manual (OM/A) and in the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM), Vol. 3, and the description given was misleading.. The recommended crosswind landing technique was not clearly described in the aircraft standard documentation.. The limited effect of lateral control (after a main gear touchdown) was unknown.”.
