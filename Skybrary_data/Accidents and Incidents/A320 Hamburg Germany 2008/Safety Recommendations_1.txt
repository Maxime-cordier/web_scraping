During the Investigation, on 20 March 2009 the BFU issued five Safety Recommendations. To Airbus that: The aircraft manufacturer should take immediate steps to ensure that the landing technique most recently described (March 2009) should be incorporated in the flight operations documentation for the Airbus Types A318/A319/A320/A321. The descriptions given in FCOM, FCTM, in the FCOM Bulletins, FOBNs and all other documents should be uniform, clear and understandable without any contradictions.Recommendation No.: 12/2009 Should it not be possible to implement recommendation 12/09 without delay for editorial reasons, or for reasons of unalterable amendment procedures for the respective flight documents, the aircraft manufacturer should inform all operators of the Airbus Types A318/A319/A320/A321 without delay and in suitable form, about the circumstances of this Serious Incident and the planned changes.Recommendation No.: 13/2009 To Lufthansa that: It must be ensured that the crosswind landing technique described in the Operations Manual, Part B (OM/B), Chapter 2, is the same as the instructions and descriptions given by the aircraft manufacturer. When incorporating supplements and background information that are not incorporated in the aircraft manufacturer's FCOM documentation into the description of crosswind landing techniques, the working process and an associated quality assurance (QA) procedure should be described and applied; the QA procedure should ensure plausibility and correctness of the instructions and check for the absence of instructions and descriptions that are contrary to those of the aircraft manufacturer.Recommendation No.: 14/2009 It must be ensured that the crosswind landing technique given in the Operations Manual, Part D (OM/D) is not in conflict with that described in OM/B.Recommendation No.: 15/2009 To the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (German Civil Aviation Authority) that: The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt should ensure that maximum crosswind take-off and landing speeds are set for German Air Operators. Within the context of flight operations management, all air operators should examine the handbooks provided by different aircraft manufacturers for different aircraft types and study how the handbook wording maximum crosswind demonstrated is interpreted and acted upon. When indicated, an instruction should be issued based on EU-OPS 1.015 to require that maximum crosswind values be set for crosswind take-offs and landings.Recommendation No.16/2009 Upon the conclusion of the Investigation, the BFU issued seven further Safety Recommendations: To Airbus that: The aircraft manufacturer should initiate an assessment for the Aircraft Type A320 and Series with the aim that the transition logic Flight Mode/Ground Mode of the lateral control system switches into Ground Mode only if the aircraft is indeed on the ground. At the same time the updated landing technique in strong crosswind conditions should be taken into account. Furthermore, it should be ensured that such a change will not limit or impede existing system functionalities for other situations.Recommendation No.: 01/2010 The aircraft manufacturer should, as a transitory action (until the Safety Recommendation No. 01/2010 has come into effect), amend the system descriptions for the lateral control in the flight operations documentation (FCOM, etc.) and training documentation for the Aircraft Type A320 and Series indicating that under certain circumstances limited rudder deflection may occur during
