On 5 June 2014, an Augusta AW139 (C-GYNM) being operated by Ornge Rotor Wing on a positioning Medevac flight from Ottawa to Pembroke ON as LF4 began to hover taxi beyond the runway 25 holding point towards the runway at the same time as an Airbus A300-600 (N748FD) being operated by Federal Express on a flight from Mirabel (Montreal) to Ottawa was about to land on the other end of the same runway in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). The TWR Controller saw the incursion and instructed the AW139 to stop. By the time it did this, the A300 was just under 800 metres away and by the time it reached the intersection involved, it was at taxi speed and waited until the AW139 had returned to the holding point before continuing to clear the runway.
