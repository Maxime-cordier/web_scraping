the possibility of confusion with the standard expression "line up and wait". The formally documented Findings of the Investigation were as follows: Causes and Contributing factors While holding short of Runway 25 on Taxiway Echo, LF4 Medevac was given an amendment to its instrument flight rules clearance. The airport controller’s first transmission to LF4 Medevac began with non-standard phraseology “while we wait”, which can be confused with “line up and wait”.. Based on experience when departing the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport on an instrument flight rules flight, the LF4 Medevac pilot flying expected that a clearance to take off would follow the amendment to the instrument flight rules clearance.. The probable distraction caused by listening to and processing the amendment, while setting the new heading on the heading bug, likely resulted in the LF4 Medevac pilot flying not checking if the runway was clear before taxiing across the hold short line, leading to the runway incursion.. There was a risk of collision as Federal Express Flight 152 was landing on Runway 25 and LF4 Medevac was taxiing across the hold short line on Taxiway Echo proceeding to Runway 25.. Risk If air traffic control uses non-standard phraseology, there is a risk of inconsistencies and miscommunication between air traffic control and the pilot.. If flight crews do not follow company standard operating procedures before taxiing onto a runway, there is an increased risk of collision between aircraft.. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 10 June 2015 and released on 15 July 2015. No Safety Recommendations were made.
