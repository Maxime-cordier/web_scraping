On 17 March 2017, during day VMC, a Bombardier CRJ 700 (F-GRZL) being operated by Air France subsidiary HOP! on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Biarritz to Lyon as HOP83A which had just landed on runway 35R was cleared to cross runway 35L by a TWR controller who had just cleared an Airbus A319 (G-EZAZ) being operated by Easyjet on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Lyon to Nantes as EZY748Z to takeoff from the same runway. The CRJ 700 crew checked the runway before crossing and when they saw the A319 approaching at high speed, brought their aircraft to a stop clear of the runway just ahead of the controller recognising the conflict and an actual runway incursion was avoided.
