cowl door detection "through design solutions" were being considered by Airbus, it was also noted that under the EASA CS 25 Type Certification process, the fan cowl doors are classified as a structure. This meant that there was no requirement under engines installation in accordance with CS 25.901 and fan cowl doors in particular in accordance with CS 25.1193 for a System Safety Assessment (SSA) of the type which is required for fuselage doors, hatches, access panels and covers under CS 25.783(a)(2). EASA was stated to have advised the Investigation that "until the G-EUOE event, fan cowl loss was not perceived to be a potentially catastrophic failure mode". However, it was noted that "no formal risk assessment had been undertaken to support this conclusion". It was considered as a result of the Investigation that “this event has shown that the consequences of fan cowl door detachment are unpredictable and can present a greater risk to flight safety than previously experienced”. This was considered to warrant a change in the CS25 certification process to include fan cowl doors in the System Safety Assessment for engine installation during both initial type certification and in service modifications.
