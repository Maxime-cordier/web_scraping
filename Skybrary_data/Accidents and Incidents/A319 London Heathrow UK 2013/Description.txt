On 24 May 2013, an Airbus A319 [G-EUOE] being operated by British Airways on a scheduled passenger flight from London Heathrow to Oslo lost the fan cowl doors on both engines at take off in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). During the subsequent return to land, an external fire began on the right engine which could not be extinguished even after it had been shut down. A 'MAYDAYâ€™ was declared to ATC and after stopping on the runway, the fire on the right hand side was put out and an emergency evacuation took place on the left hand side. None of the 80 occupants were injured during evacuation but the aircraft sustained extensive debris impact and fire damage mainly to the right hand engine and wing.
