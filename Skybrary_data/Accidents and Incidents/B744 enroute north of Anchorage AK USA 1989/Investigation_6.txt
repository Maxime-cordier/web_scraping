(as may have happened in the investigated event when some autostarts were manually interrupted).. This guidance also covered the consequences of loss of airspeed indications if volcanic ash blocks the pitot system and recommended using the OM procedure for "flight with unreliable airspeed" or, if all airspeed indicators are unreliable or loss of airspeed occurs simultaneously with an all-engine thrust loss, shutdown, or flameout, then the attitude indicator should be used to establish a -1° pitch attitude. Inertial ground speed may be used for reference if indicated airspeed is unreliable or lost and ATC may be able to provide ground speed during an approach to land. The Probable Cause of the event was formally documented as an “inadvertent encounter with volcanic ash cloud, which resulted in damage from foreign material (foreign object) and subsequent compressor stalling of all engines”. A Contributory Factor was also identified as “the lack of available information about the ash cloud to all personnel involved”. No related Safety Recommendations are recorded as having been made as a result of the Investigation. A ‘Final Report’ of the investigation was adopted by the NTSB 30 June 1992 but it contains only a single page of text and some supporting factual data. Secondary sources which had access to relevant information available during the Investigation and used in the preparation of this report were primarily taken from the following US Geological Survey (USGS) publications: USGS Circular 1065 Program and Abstracts from the First International Symposium on Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety Seattle (1991). USGS Bulletin 2047 Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety (1994). Information was also obtained from the public record of a Hearing under the auspices of the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation (2006)
