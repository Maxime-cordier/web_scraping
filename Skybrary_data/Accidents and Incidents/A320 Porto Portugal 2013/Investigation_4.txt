assumption by one pilot to be identified and corrected by the other, is impossible in silence and it also "remains unclear whether the check has taken place or has been forgotten". It was concluded that the Cause of the Serious Incident was "the fact that the aircraft did not reach the necessary flight performance on take-off, because the flight crew performed the take-off from a runway intersection with an engine power which had been calculated for the entire length of the runway‚Äù. Four Contributory Factors were identified as follows: the fact that the commander was distracted by external circumstances during take-off preparations. the incomplete examination of the take-off data within the frame of the 'before start' checklist. procedures which stipulated individual checks only "if required". the fact that essential checks were performed in silence.. Safety Action taken by the Aircraft Operator since the occurrence of the investigated event were noted to have included the following: SOPs were amended to require that the PM must perform an additional and independent take-off performance calculation - it was stated to the Investigation that "the operator had already decided on this amendment at the time of the Serious Incident, but had not yet published it".. A reduction in the number of Company Manuals directly relevant to aircraft operation had been made which had improved clarity.. The 'Before Take-Off' procedure had been amended to require that before their 'Take-Off All Green' call, both pilots must have silently examined - from memory - a series of additional status points.. The Final Report] of the Investigation was approved by the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board on 13 August 2015 and published on 21 August 2015. No Safety Recommendations were made.
