On 6 March 2009, a Bombardier CRJ 705 being operated by Air Canada Jazz on a daylight scheduled domestic passenger flight from Vancouver BC to Whitehorse landed on runway 31L without clearance and after overflying two snow sweepers operating on the same runway. There was no contact between the aircraft and the vehicles or any abrupt avoidance manoeuvre and none of the 58 aircraft occupants or those in the vehicles were injured.
