On 19 February 2021, an ATR72-500 (EC-LYJ) being operated by Swiftair completed an apparently uneventful scheduled domestic cargo flight from Palma de Mallorca to Madrid but a post flight maintenance inspection found that the inner left main landing gear wheel tyre tread was missing. The Madrid airport authority were advised and an inspection of the landing runway used and taxi route in was carried out but nothing was found. The following morning, only after a flight which departed from the same runway at Palma as the Swiftair aircraft had done reported having seen tyre debris on the runway was the missing tyre tread subsequently found.
