On 5 March 2011, an Airbus A320-200 being operated by Finnair on a scheduled passenger flight from Helsinki to London Heathrow was en route in Swedish airspace in the cruise at FL360 in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when the no 2 bleed air system failed. Because the aircraft was operating under release to service with No 1 bleed air system inoperative and both air conditioning packs were being supplied by No 2 system, an emergency descent became necessary. It was subsequently possible to restart the failed bleed air system and the planned flight was continued to destination at a lower altitude.
