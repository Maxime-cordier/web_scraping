more detailed analysis of the topic.. During a simulator training session 18 months previously, the incident pilots had practiced emergency descents. The investigators considered it “sensible to also practice declaring an emergency, so as to lower the functional threshold for doing so”.. The applicable Airbus QRH was noted to “repeatedly use the expression 'descend rapidly' in the context of in-flight depressurisation” It was considered that this phrase “may lead flight crews to believe that the situation does not entail an emergency” when in fact “aircraft depressurisation is always an emergency and flight crews should use the phrase 'emergency descent' in their transmissions”.. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed on 17 January 2013 and subsequently made available in English translation.
