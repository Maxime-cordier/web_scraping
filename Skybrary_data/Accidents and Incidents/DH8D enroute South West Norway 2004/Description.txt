On 19 May 2004, a Bombardier DHC8-400 being operated on a scheduled passenger flight from Sandefjord to Bergen by Norwegian airline Wideroe was climbing through 13500 ft approximately 20 nm west north west of Sandefjord in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when there was a loud 'bang' from the left engine followed quickly by total power failure and a fire warning for that engine. The crew carried out the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) drill, declared an emergency and made a return to Sandefjord. Although the left hand engine was shut down and both engine fire bottles had been discharged, the engine warning remained illuminated throughout the remainder of the flight. The aircraft was stopped on the runway after landing and a successful emergency evacuation of all 31 occupants was carried out with no injuries whilst the Airport Fire Service attended to the fire source.
