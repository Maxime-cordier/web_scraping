On 16 May 2018, prescribed vertical and horizontal separation was lost in day VMC between an Airbus A310 (C-GFAT) being operated by Air Transat on an instrument flight rules flight from Toronto to Montréal as TSC485 and a privately-operated Cessna 421 (C-GADG) on an IFR flight from Trois-Rivières to Montréal as both were being positioned to ILS approaches on adjacent parallel runways, minimum separation being 500 feet and 1.7 nm as both were being turned away from each other by different sector controllers.
