forgot to transfer the Cessna.. During the verbal briefing and exchange of aircraft information between the low arrivals controller on-the-job instructor and the low arrivals controller-in-training information about the Cessna was not provided. Therefore, the low arrivals controller-in-training did not have an opportunity to incorporate knowledge of the converging instrument flight rules traffic into his awareness of the traffic situation.. The low arrivals controller on-the-job instructor was distracted from his on-the-job instructor responsibilities, from monitoring the radar display and from the operation; as a result, he did not adequately monitor the developing situation or the operation.. It was noted that the TSB was “not aware” of any Safety Action taken as a result of the investigated event whilst the Investigation was in progress. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 3 June 2019 and it was officially released on 10 July 2019. No Safety Recommendations were made.
