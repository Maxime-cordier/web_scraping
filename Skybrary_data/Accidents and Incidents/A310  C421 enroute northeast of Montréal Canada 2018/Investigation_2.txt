passing 16,700 feet for 8,000 feet contacted the AN controller and was advised to expect runway 24R. Two minutes later, the shift supervisor reopened the LO sector position having received a handover briefing from the AN controller which included reference to the Cessna 421 which was at 4,000 feet still 37 nm northeast of the airport and about to enter the DN sector through which it would pass before reaching the LO sector. As it did so, 34 nm northeast of the airport, the A310 was 18 nm west of the airport still on a STAR right hand downwind leg for runway 24R and descending through 11,900 feet for 8000 feet. After re-clearance to 6,000 feet, the flight was transferred to the LO sector, where the trainee controller supervised by the shift supervisor, had just taken over the position. His briefing from the shift supervisor had included the A310 but not the C421, which by that time was no longer visible on the radar display as its range had been reduced, although the trainee controller reported having noticed it on the wider range display in the DN sector but under AN sector control responsibility. When the A310 checked in on the LO sector frequency passing 6,700 feet for 6,000 feet and 6 nm north northwest, the trainee controller re-cleared the flight to 4,000 feet. Ninety seconds later, with the A310 still on a downwind track and now 10 nm northeast of the airport, the Cessna 421 entered the LO sector level at 4000 feet on a direct south westerly track towards the SLOKA waypoint - see the recorded radar display at that point below. Soon afterwards, the A310 was instructed to make a right turn onto a base leg heading of 150°and re-cleared to 3000 feet, after which the trainee asked the OJI about the Cessna 421 which had entered the LO sector and which was now 6.4 nm from the A310. There was no response to a call made to the Cessna 421 by the OJI and he asked the AN controller to get its pilot to call the LO sector. Almost immediately however, the C421, now just 3.6 nm from the A310 as the latter continued its right turn onto base leg passing 3,900 feet, called the AN controller. A few seconds later, lateral separation between the A310 and the C421 was lost as the C421 closed to within 2.8 nm of the A310 with only 200 feet of vertical clearance. The AN controller instructed the C421 to turn left onto 150° followed five seconds later by an instruction to turn further left onto 100°. A further five seconds showed that whilst the two aircraft were only 2.2 nm apart, vertical separation was continuing to increase as the A310 continued its descent to 3000 feet whilst the C421 remained at 4000 feet. The AN controller advised the C421 pilot that the A310 was approximately one mile ahead in a relative 1 o’clock position and descending though 3,500 feet
