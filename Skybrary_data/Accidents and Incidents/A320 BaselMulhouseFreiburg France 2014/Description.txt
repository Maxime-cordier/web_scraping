On 6 October 2014, the crew of an Airbus A320 (HB-IOP) being operated by Belair Airlines on an international passenger flight from Basel to Djerba as BHP 2532 made a take-off from an intersection with 2370 metres of runway length available using the reduced thrust calculated for the full runway length of 3900 metres. TOGA thrust was applied as the end of the runway got nearer and the aircraft rotated so as to achieve an otherwise uneventful take off. The rest of the flight was competed as intended.
