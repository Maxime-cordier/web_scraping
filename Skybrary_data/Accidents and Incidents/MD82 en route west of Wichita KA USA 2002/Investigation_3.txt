stall associated with the reduction in engine power. Factors were the presence of ice crystals at altitude, and the icing of the engine inlet probes resulting in a false engine pressure ratio indication." Two Safety Recommendations were issued during the Investigation: that the FAA should issue a flight standards information bulletin to principal operations inspectors to alert all affected air carrier flight crews about the icing situation encountered by Spirit Airlines flight 970 and to emphasize the need to maintain vigilance for the signs of high altitude icing conditions, the effect these conditions can have on airplane and engine performance, and the need for the appropriate use of the engine anti-ice system. [A-04-34]. that the FAA should actively pursue research with airplane and engine manufacturers and other industry personnel to develop an ice detector that would alert pilots of inlet pressure probe icing and require that it be installed on new production turbojet airplanes, as well as retrofitted to existing turbojet airplanes. [A-04-35]. The Final Report of the Investigation was adopted by the NTSB on 28 January 2005. The letter communicating the two Safety Recommendations to the FAA was dated 29 April 2004. This letter includes a summary of the background and analysis which led to them.
