On 4 June 2002, a McDonnell Douglas MD82 (N823NK) was being operated by Spirit Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Denver to Fort Lauderdale as NK970. In the cruise at FL330 in day IMC the aircraft stalled after a sudden loss of thrust from both engines. Recovery and restoration of normal thrust was only achieved after a significant loss of altitude and a diversion to Wichita was then made involving an overweight landing. None of the 111 occupants were injured and the aircraft was not damaged.
