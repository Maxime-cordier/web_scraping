speed brakes automatically deployed on touchdown, maximum manual braking was immediately commenced and reverse thrust selected and 12 seconds after touchdown, the aircraft had slowed to 15 knots and the low speed excursion followed which included a reversal of direction to backtrack as cleared. An annotated representation of the landing roll. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The Air India stabilised approach policy contained in the OM was found to state that “if an approach gets destabilised due to any significant deviation it must be stabilised (at the) latest by 1000 feet agl during an instrument approach, 500 feet agl during a visual approach or 300 feet agl during a circling approach”. It also stated that “if the above altitude limitation for stabilisation is not achieved (then) the pilot is required to carry out go-around”. In respect of the defect entry relating to low braking action raised by the Captain after the flight, it was noted that no similar defects had been recorded in the 15 days prior to or after the incident sectors. The Cause of the event was determined as “the aircraft continued landing after an unstabilised approach and a prolonged flare resulted in a delayed touchdown and subsequent runway excursion”. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Air India should reiterate the safety circular highlighting the incident and advising all crew to carry out a go around when an approach is not stabilised.. That the DGCA HQ should take such other action is it seems fit with reference to the formally documented findings of the Investigation as to Cause.. The Final Report was completed on 5 November 2020 and published later the same month.
