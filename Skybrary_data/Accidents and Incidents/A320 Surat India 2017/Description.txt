On 4 October 2017, a Airbus A320 (VT-ESE) being operated by Air India on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Delhi to Surat as AI493 marginally overran the displaced threshold landing runway 22 at destination after an unstabilised approach in day VMC was followed by a late touchdown with insufficient distance remaining in which to stop. ATC were unaware of the overrun and it was not reported by the flight crew. None of the 151 occupants were injured and the aircraft was not damaged although several runway thresholds lights were. The return flight to Delhi was subsequently operated by the same flight crew.
