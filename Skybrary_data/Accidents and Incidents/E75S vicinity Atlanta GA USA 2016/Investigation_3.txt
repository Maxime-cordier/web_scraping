without the further memory action which would have enabled them to quickly re-trim the aircraft. It has been noted that the FAA Flight Operations Inspectorate has now requested that the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and QRH at Republic Airways replicate the memory items in Embraer’s 'Pitch Trim Runaway' drill. As a result of the findings of the Investigation so far, a total of ten Safety Recommendations have been made as follows: that the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil require Embraer to develop instructions for operators of Embraer EMB-170/175/190/195/Lineage 1000 series airplanes to inspect the wiring in the Captain’s and First Officer’s control columns for damage, replace where needed and ensure proper clearance from adjacent components, including the forward mechanical stop bolt and its safety wire.. [A-20-1] that the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil, once Embraer develops inspection instructions for the wiring in the Captain’s and First Officer’s control columns as requested in Safety Recommendation A-20-1, require operators of Embraer EMB-170/175/190/195/Lineage 1000 series airplanes to inspect that wiring for damage, in compliance with Embraer’s instructions, replace where needed and ensure proper clearance from adjacent components, including the forward mechanical stop bolt and its safety wire.. [A-20-2] that the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil, once inspections are completed as outlined in the instructions developed in response to Safety Recommendation A-20-1, require Embraer to review the inspection results and revise design and maintenance documentation for Embraer EMB-170/175/190/195/Lineage 1000 series airplanes as necessary to prevent any hazards identified during the inspections.. [A-20-3] that the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil, once Embraer revises design and maintenance documentation for Embraer EMB-170/175/190/195/Lineage 1000 series airplanes as requested in Safety Recommendation A-20-3, require operators of these airplanes to incorporate these changes.. [A-20-4] that the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil, mandate the incorporation of Embraer Service Bulletins (SB) 170-27-0051, 190-27-0039, and 190LIN-27-0019 on all applicable airplanes, as specified in the SBs.. [A-20-5] that the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil, in coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration, Embraer, and US operators, determine if changes to the Embraer EMB170/175/190/195/Lineage 1000 series airplane Pitch Trim Runaway checklists are required to adequately address all potential trim system failures, and make such changes as necessary.. [A-20-6] that the Federal Aviation Administration, once Embraer develops inspection instructions for the wiring on the Captain’s and First Officer’s control columns as requested in Safety Recommendation A-20-1, require operators of Embraer EMB-170/175/190/195/Lineage 1000 series airplanes to inspect that wiring for damage, in compliance with Embraer’s instructions, replace where needed, and ensure proper clearance from adjacent components, including the forward mechanical stop bolt and its safety wire.. [A-20-7] that the Federal Aviation Administration, once Embraer revises (the) design and maintenance documentation for Embraer EMB-170/175/190/195/Lineage 1000 series airplanes as requested in Safety Recommendation A-20-3, require operators of these airplanes to incorporate these changes.. [A-20-8] that the Federal Aviation Administration mandate the incorporation of Embraer Service Bulletins (SB) 170-27-0051,190-27-0039 and 190LIN-27-0019 on all applicable airplanes, as specified in the SBs.. [A-20-9] that the Federal Aviation
