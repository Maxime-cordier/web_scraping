use among the criteria assessed when authorising a scheduled air carrier to operate its aircraft on a regular basis at an airport certificated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 139. [A-21-51]. that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency identify all currently certificated transport-category aircraft for which system safety assessments for landing gear systems did not consider human error that could lead to cross-wiring of antiskid brake system components, including the wheel speed transducers, and require manufacturers of transport-category aircraft without such assessments to perform the assessments and then implement mitigations to prevent cross-wiring of antiskid brake system components. [A-21-52]. that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency require the submission and consideration of system safety assessments addressing the landing gear antiskid system for the certification of future transport-category airplane designs. The certification should ensure that the system safety assessments are consistent with the intent of AMC 25.1309, Systems Design and Analysis and that the assessments evaluate and mitigate the potential for human error that can lead to a cross-wiring error. [A-21-53]. that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency require organisations that design, manufacture, and maintain aircraft to establish a safety management system. [A-21-54]. that the Saab Group redesign the wheel speed transducer wire harnesses for the Saab 2000 aircraft to prevent the harnesses from being installed incorrectly during maintenance and overhaul. [A-21-55]. The Final Report of the Investigation was dated 2 November 2021 and subsequently published.
