However, since it was established that completion of a safe landing could have been achieved following the touchdown made in all the prevailing conditions except for a loss of wheel braking capability in excess of 50%, it was only the 75% loss of wheel braking capability which made this impossible. It was considered that “a more robust design of the Saab 2000 wheel speed transducer wire harnesses could have mitigated the potential for the incorrect installation of the harnesses” and noted that the potential for such an error during installation or maintenance is present in the case of other aircraft types. The absence of any requirement for safety management systems to be in place at aircraft designers, manufacturers and maintenance facilities was considered to make it less likely that potential operational safety risks would be identified and effectively mitigated. The Investigation also examined the effect which relevant aircraft operator procedures and their application and the FAA regulatory oversight of the operator might have had on the accident outcome. It was considered that during the course of the approaches to land at Unalaska, the Captain had “demonstrated inadequate aeronautical decision-making skills regarding which runway to use for landing” and that by continuing and completing an approach to a runway likely to involve a significant tailwind component for landing, he had also “demonstrated a lack of flight deck Leadership”. It was also considered that “the Captain might not have fully understood the challenges associated with landing the Saab 2000 at Unalaska because he had not achieved the experience that the company-designated pilot-in-command airport qualification policy intended”. In this respect it was noted that aircraft operator PenAir’s decision to allow the Captain to operate at Unalaska Airport as an unsupervised Captain when he had yet to meet the applicable documented airport qualification criteria was directly contrary to the intent of this requirement to ensure the necessary skill and experience level to operate at the airport existed. A wider examination of PenAir’s SMS as documented and applied identified both “hard” and “soft” deficiencies which significantly decreased its effectiveness and in particular had “resulted in reduced pilot feedback to management about safety concerns”. FAA oversight of PenAir during a particularly challenging period in the 2½ years prior to the accident and especially during the restarting of scheduled passenger service operations was found to have been “insufficient to identify safety risks resulting from the company’s bankruptcy, reduced route structure, loss of experienced pilots, acquisition and merger”. It was also found that there was no evidence that the FAA had actively considered the dimensions of the Unalaska runway 13 RESA during the process which had led to issue of an approval for PenAir to operate the Saab 2000 to the airport and that such a consideration could help increase an aircraft’s margin of safety should a runway overrun occur. The Probable Cause of the accident was determined as “the landing gear manufacturer’s incorrect wiring of the wheel speed transducer harnesses on the left main landing gear during
