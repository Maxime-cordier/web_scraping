On 9 September 2007 the crew of a Bombardier DHC8-400 (LN-RDK) being operated by SAS on a scheduled domestic passenger flight (214) from Copenhagen to Aalborg found during approach to destination that it was not possible to confirm that the right MLG was locked down. The alternate gear extension procedure did not resolve the fault and after declaring an emergency and holding to reduce the quantity of fuel on board, a landing was made in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) during which the right MLG collapsed, directional control was lost and a runway excursion followed. The runway surface was damaged by propeller blade impact and the right MLG, right engine and propeller and the aft lower fuselage of the aircraft all suffered major damage. Seven of the 73 occupants sustained minor injuries of which one was caused when hit by a propeller blade, one of two which penetrated the passenger cabin during the landing when the right wing dropped.
