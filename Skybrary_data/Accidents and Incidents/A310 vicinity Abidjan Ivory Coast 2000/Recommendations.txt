The following three recommendations were made in connection to the accident: “…the Commission of Inquiry recommended, on 9 August 2001, that Civil Aviation Authorities ask training organizations and operators under their authority to integrate into type rating and recurrent training programs, for crews of all aircraft likely to be subject to false stall warnings, the elements necessary to recognize and manage such a false alarm during phases of flight close to the ground.”. During the investigation it was found that a new recovery from approach to stall procedure was published after the accident. In connection to this, the Commission of Inquiry recommended that: “…the French DGAC ensure that Airbus harmonizes the procedures in the FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) with those taught during type rating training.”. The third and final recommendation addresses the means to provide a comprehensive SAR operation at water for coastal airports: “…civil aviation authorities responsible for coastal airports or those near water ensure that appropriate equipment (aerial, maritime, etc.) be put in place so as to ensure immediate intervention at an accident site located in an area near a coastal airport.”.
