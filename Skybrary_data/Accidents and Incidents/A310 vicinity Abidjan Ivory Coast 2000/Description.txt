On 30 January 2000, an Airbus 310 took off at night from Abidjan (Ivory Coast) bound for Lagos, Nigeria then Nairobi, Kenya. Thirty-three seconds after take-off, the airplane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, 1.5 nautical miles south of the runway at Abidjan Airport. 169 persons died and 10 were injured in the accident. The departure time for the flight was scheduled for 21:00 - the copilot was pilot flying and the captain was pilot monitoring. Less than 5 minutes to 21:00, the crew was given start-up clearance. A few minutes later, the Captain reported to the ground mechanic “we have two normal start-ups”. At 21:07:35 the airplane began to taxi. The tower controller issued take-off clearance and asked the crew to call back upon reaching flight level 40. 32 seconds after the application of take-off power, the Captain announced “V1 and Rotate”. “At 21 h 08 min 57 s, the copilot announced "Positive rate of climb, gear up". Less than two seconds later the stall warning sounded. At 21 h 09 min 07 s, the automatic call out (AC) announced 300 feet. At 21 h 09 min 14 s, the copilot asked "what’s the problem?". From 21 h 09 min 16 s, the AC announced successively 200, 100, 50, 30, 20 and 10 feet. Meanwhile, at 21 h 09 min 18 s, the copilot ordered the aural warning to be cut. Two seconds later, the GPWS/TAWS sounded the “Whoop…” alarm followed, a half a second later, by the AC announcement of 50 feet. At 21 h 09 min 22 s, an aural master warning started, immediately followed by an order from the Captain to climb: "Go up!", though this was preceded six tenths of a second by the AC announcement of 10 feet. At 21 h 09 min 23.9 s, end of the master warning, followed immediately within a tenth of a second by the noise of the impact.”
