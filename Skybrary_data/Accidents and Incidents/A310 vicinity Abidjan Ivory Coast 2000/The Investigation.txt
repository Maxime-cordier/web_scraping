The Commission of Inquiry concluded that the cause of the accident to flight KQ 431 was a collision with the sea that resulted from the partial application of stall recovery procedure. Pilot flying pushed forward on the control column to stop the stick shaker, following the initiation of a stall warning on rotation, while the airplane was not in a true stall situation. He did not apply TOGA (Take-off/Go Around) thrust on the engines. The investigators were not able to determine whether the other two actions were performed: wing levelling and speed brake retraction check.
