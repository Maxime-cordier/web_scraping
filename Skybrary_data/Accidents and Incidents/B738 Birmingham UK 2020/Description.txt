On 21 July 2020, the flight crew of a Boeing 737-800 (G-TAWG) being operated by TUI Airways on a passenger flight from Birmingham to Palma noticed a significant discrepancy (1,606 kg) between the estimated weights on their Operational Flight Plan and those on the loadsheet, the latter being lower. Having carefully examined the various differences and rationalised the likely origin of various discrepancies, they used the loadsheet figures for calculating the takeoff performance figures and the subsequent departure and flight proceeded normally and an error in the derivation of the loadsheet weights was only identified subsequently.
