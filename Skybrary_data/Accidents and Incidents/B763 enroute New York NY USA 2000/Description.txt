On 30 March 2000, the crew of a Boeing 767-300 being operated by Delta Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from New York JFK to Frankfurt temporarily lost control of the aircraft during the climb whilst flying manually in 'dark night' VMC with an augmenting 'relief pilot' present on the flight deck. A successful recovery was made with no consequences for the occupants and the aircraft then returned to New York
