The NTSB finding of probable cause was that “the flight crews excessive airspeed and flight path angle during the approach and landing and its failure to abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met” and that “contributing to the accident was the controller’s positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flight crew other than a go-around manoeuvre”.
