On 2 February 2019, a Bombardier CRJ200 (N902EV) being operated by SkyWest Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Chicago O’Hare to Montréal as SKW3130 had been cleared to land on runway 24L in day IMC but had to discontinue its approach as snow clearance vehicles entered the runway ahead when the aircraft was less than 160 feet agl. It subsequently overflew the lead vehicles, which by then were on the runway centreline, by less than 100 feet. The flight was subsequently completed without further event 15 minutes later.
