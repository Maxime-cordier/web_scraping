On 2 November 2017, an Airbus A320 (EI-GAL) being operated by Aer Lingus on a scheduled international passenger flight from Cork to London Heathrow declared a ‘MAYDAY’ and turned back to Cork after a “strong and persistent” burning smell became apparent in both the flight deck and the passenger cabin as the aircraft climbed through FL260. After stopping on the runway for an assessment of the situation, it was judged safe to taxi to stand and once there, a ‘Rapid Disembarkation’ was ordered which was misinterpreted by some of the 143 passengers as an emergency evacuation and resulted in the over wing exits being used by some.
