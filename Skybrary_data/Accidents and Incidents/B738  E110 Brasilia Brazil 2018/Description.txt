On 10 April 2018, in night normal visibility conditions, a Boeing 737-800 being operated by Gol on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Brasilia to São Luís with 160 persons on board began takeoff from runway 11L in accordance with its clearance, but as it approached rotation, the crew saw another aircraft - an Embraer 110 being operated by the Brazilian Air Force on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Santa Cruz to Brasilia - that had just landed on the same runway ahead and were only just able to overfly it.
