Agency (ANAC) works together with airport operator INFRAMERICA and the Air Space Control Department (DECEA), in order to evaluate the pertinence of the inclusion of hot spots on the Brasilia International Aerodrome Chart, in order to alert the pilots operating at that aerodrome regarding the existence of blind spots in the manoeuvring area. [IG-065/CENIPA/2018 - 04]. that the Airspace Control Department (DECEA) analyse the pertinence of establishing, with clarity and in standard, the moment or position in which, after landing, the crew of an aircraft should change frequency from the Tower Control to Ground Control. [IG-065/CENIPA/2018 - 05]. that the Airspace Control Department (DECEA) alert Brazilian air traffic controllers about the importance of using standard phraseology contained in the applicable procedures (MCA 100-16), notably in what refers to the item (3.4.3.4) on instructions after landing, where an example of correct message is presented. [IG-065/CENIPA/2018 - 06]. that the Airspace Control Department (DECEA) alert Brazilian air traffic controllers about the importance of using the phraseology provided in (the applicable guidance) item 6.14.6.4 of ICA 100-37/2017, which states that, when necessary or desirable, a controller may instruct a crew to report immediately once their aircraft has cleared the runway in use. [IG-065/CENIPA/2018 - 07]. that the Airspace Control Department (DECEA) analyse the pertinence of establishing an Operational Model that clearly defines the procedures to be adopted by the air traffic controllers of the different positions of the Bras√≠lia International Aerodrome Control Tower in relation to the coordination of traffic when they are passing through the blind spots of the aerodrome. [IG-065/CENIPA/2018 - 08]. that the Airspace Control Department (DECEA) evaluate the viability of implementing a Surface Movement Radar at Brasilia International Aerodrome, in order to mitigate the risks of runway incursion, due to the various blind spots on the aerodrome. [IG-065/CENIPA/2018 - 09]. The Final Report was completed on 18 December 2020 and published online in both an English translation and in the definitive Portuguese language on 2 January 2021.
