On 12 March 2014, an Airbus A319 (F-GRHT) being operated by Air France on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Marseilles to Paris CDG experienced an uncommanded left engine failure as it neared its destination in day VMC followed by a failure of the APU after this had been started in response to the engine failure. An emergency was declared and a landing was subsequently achieved without further event. An empty left fuel tank was found to have been the cause of both failures but just over final reserve fuel was found in the right fuel tank.
