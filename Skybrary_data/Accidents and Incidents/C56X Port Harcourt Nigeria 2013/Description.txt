On 14 July 2011, a Cessna Citation 560XLS (5N-BMM) being operated by Bristow Helicopters Nigeria on a company passenger flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt left the side of the landing runway shortly after a high impact night touchdown in reportedly normal ground visibility. The aircraft hit the ground hard and shortly afterwards made a rapid turn through 90Ëš before stopping. It sustained substantial damage and two of the four passengers received minor injuries. The crew did not communicate with ATC after the crash and even after the AFS had been alerted, it took some time to locate the aircraft and render assistance to the occupants who had all walked clear of the aircraft. The AFS found that the crew had left the right hand engine running when they evacuated the aircraft and used their high pressure water hoses to shut it down.
