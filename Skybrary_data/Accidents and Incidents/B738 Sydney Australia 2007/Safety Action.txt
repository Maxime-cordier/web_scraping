The Investigation noted that, as a result of this occurrence, the aircraft operator initiated a review of procedures for the training syllabus for recurrent and induction training. The review included briefing and assessment on the correct procedure for commencing a take-off roll. The briefing now includes: The correct procedures to be followed when commencing the take-off roll, including runway alignment prior to thrust application, engine stabilisation with symmetrical thrust prior to advancing thrust levers to take-off thrust (selecting TO/GA) and the use of the nose-wheel steering wheel during the take-off roll.. Ensuring thrust is symmetrical and stabilised, and the aircraft aligned with the runway centreline before selecting TO/GA.. In addition, a low-speed rejected takeoff is to be completed during recurrent training and the correct take-off thrust setting procedures have been incorporated in induction training. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 18 February 2009 and may be seen at SKYbrary bookshelf: Aviation Occurrence Investigation AO-2007-023 Final No Safety Recommendations were made.
