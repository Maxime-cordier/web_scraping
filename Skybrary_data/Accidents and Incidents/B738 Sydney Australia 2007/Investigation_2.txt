in the sequence, so that they overlay the acceleration phase of the left engine, to assist in making a comparison between the individual engines’ performance characteristics while accelerating. The slopes of the blue and brown lines during the acceleration phase depicted in Figure 4 are approximately the same. This indicates that, if both engines had accelerated from the same N1 setting, their thrust would have remained symmetrical. Just prior to the thrust on both engines being reduced, when N1 for each engine was 64% and 98% respectively, the left engine’s thrust would be about three times the right engine’s thrust, which can also be seen from the respective engine fuel flows depicted in Figure 4."
