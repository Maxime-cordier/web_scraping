On 4 August 2014, a DHC8-400 (C-FOEN) being operated by Westjet Encore on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Winnipeg to Thunder Bay as WEN3112 continued taxiing beyond the holding point for an expected intersection departure from runway 36 in normal day visibility and only stopped when instructed to do so by ATC. A Boeing 737-700 being operated by Westjet as WJA318, which had been on short final to land on the same runway and had already received landing clearance, was instructed to go around.
