On 8 April 2015 an Airbus A320 (PR-MHV) being operated by TAM on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Recife to Brasilia struck the ground short of the destination runway landing threshold after commencing a daylight go around in IMC when the previously-acquired visual reference with the runway obtained at MDA was lost in heavy rain. The contact was transient and the subsequent climb away and subsequent approach were without further event. The 160 occupants were uninjured but the aircraft sustained main gear tyre and some minor fuselage damage and impact damage was caused to the runway threshold lighting.
