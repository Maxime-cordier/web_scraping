had been an "experienced pilot rated as instructor in the Italian Air Force who was experienced with TCAS II". It was noted that "in this instance the STCA [alert had] provided little help to the controller to avoid this conflict". The primary concerns of the Investigation were the incorrect pilot response to a TCAS RA and the lack of any international requirements for carriage of TCAS II equipment by State aircraft operating in airspace shared by civil traffic and controlled by a civil ANSP. The Cause of the occurrence was found to be "that the crew of the Dassault Falcon 900 misinterpreted the TCAS RA 'Adjust Vertical Speed, Adjust' and increased their rate of climb instead of levelling off". One Contributory Factor was also identified as follows: The wording of the TCAS II version 7.0 RA involved in this occurrence might have contributed to the incorrect pilot response.. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that all ICAO and EASA Member States should, for safety reasons, upgrade their State aircraft to TCAS ll version 7.1 as soon as possible, including when forward-fit opportunities arise.. that ICAO, EASA and the European Commission should consider encouraging their Member States to take further action to ensure the adoption of TCAS ll version 7.1 on State aircraft when operating in common airspace to mitigate the risks of loss of separation between civil and State aircraft.. The Final Report was completed during 2015 and subsequently published in English.
