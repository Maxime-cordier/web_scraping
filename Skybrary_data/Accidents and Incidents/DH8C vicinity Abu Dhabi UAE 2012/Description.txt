On 9 September, a Bombardier DHC8-300 (A6-ADB) being operated by Abu Dhabi Aviation on a scheduled contract passenger flight from Abu Dhabi to Das Island was in the initial climb out after take off in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when the flight crew became aware through visual observation from the passenger cabin that abnormal heat and possibly a fire may be present within the right engine nacelle. A PAN was declared to ATC due to the possibility of an engine fire and an uneventful return made with taxi in on the left engine made after the absence of any fire on the right engine had been confirmed. After both engines had been shutdown, it was found that both engines were in a similar abnormal state.
