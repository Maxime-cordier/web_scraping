An Investigation was carried out by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). It was established that no runway exit instructions had been given to the aircraft prior to touchdown and that an instruction to “take taxiway November, second on your right now’ had been issued as the aircraft decelerated on the landing roll prior to taxiway ‘P’. It was noted that the flight crew briefing for the approach and landing had identified taxiways P and N as the first and second exits from the landing runway. The Final Report AO-2010-011 of the Investigation was published on 29 June 2010
