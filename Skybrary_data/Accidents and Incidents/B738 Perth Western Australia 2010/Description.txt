On 24 February 2010, a Boeing 737-800 being operated by Garuda on a scheduled passenger flight from Denpasar, Indonesia to Perth failed to follow the runway exit instruction given by ATC after a daylight landing in normal visibility on runway 03 at destination and instead turned right directly onto intersecting active runway 06. ATC then instructed an expeditious exit of this runway to the right via taxiway S and no actual conflict occurred.
