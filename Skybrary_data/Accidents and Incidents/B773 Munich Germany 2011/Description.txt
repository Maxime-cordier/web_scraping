On 3 November 2011, a Boeing 777-300ER (9V-SWQ) being operated by Singapore Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Manchester to Munich veered off destination runway 08R shortly after touchdown and had then, after crossing back over the runway and off the other side, eventually stopped on the adjacent grass. The aircraft was undamaged apart from some grass and soil on the exterior of the right engine and the landing gear and the 162 uninjured occupants were able to disembark from the aircraft to buses using mobile steps brought to the aircraft.
