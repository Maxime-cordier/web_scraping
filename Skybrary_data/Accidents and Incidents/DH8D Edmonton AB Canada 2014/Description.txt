On 6 November 2014, a Bombardier DHC8-400 (C-GGBF) being operated by Jazz Aviation as Air Canada Express flight JZA8481 on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Calgary to Grande Prairie experienced a sudden failure of one of the main landing gear tyres on departure and because weather conditions precluded a return to Calgary, it was decided to divert to Edmonton where, on landing at night in normal ground visibility, it then suffered a right hand main gear collapse and partially left the runway. The aircraft sustained significant damage and propeller debris which penetrated the cabin wall led to 3 of the 71 passengers sustaining minor injuries and were taken to hospital. The emergency evacuation was quickly accomplished without further injuries occurring.
