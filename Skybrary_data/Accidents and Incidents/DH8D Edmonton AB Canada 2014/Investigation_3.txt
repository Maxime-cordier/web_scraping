that similar or other aircraft systems could fail during high-vibration conditions". The formal statement of Causes and Contributory Factors was as follows: The number 3 tyre ruptured on takeoff, most likely as a result of impact with a hard object.. During landing, the failed number 3 tyre was spun by contact with the ground and was maintained at a rotational speed that was the same as or very close to one of the natural frequencies of the main landing gear. This caused the lock links to trigger the proximity sensor electronic unit to de-energize the solenoid sequence valve, thereby relieving system pressure from the extend port of the unlock actuator.. The excessive vibration caused the lock links to overcome the force from the downlock springs and unlock the stabilizer brace as a result of gear dynamics, which led to collapse of the right main landing gear.. A Finding as to Risk was also identified as follows: If there are no specific requirements for dynamic vibration testing of components or completed airframes, there is a risk that similar or other aircraft systems could fail during high-vibration conditions.. Finally it was formally documented as an 'Other Finding' that "short-radius turns with hard braking may cause an extreme shearing force on the tread area and on the sidewalls of the number 3 tyre in particular, because it is the pivot point". Safety Action taken by the Operator as a result of the event was noted to have included the following: Retreaded MLG tyres are no longer used on the aircraft type.. Pilots of this aircraft type have been advised to avoid the use of "braking and tyre pivot whenever possible".. Guidance has been issued on arrival and departure taxi techniques for this aircraft type in order to lessen stresses on MLG tyres.. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 9 March 2016 and officially released on 6 April 2016. No Safety Recommendations were made.
