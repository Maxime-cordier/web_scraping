Two earlier Safety Recommendations were included in a Special Bulletin, S2/2017, which was published on 20 September 2017 in order to provide initial information on the circumstances of this Serious Incident and clarify requirements for the reporting of accidents and serious incidents. These both related to FMC software updates, one of which has now been superseded by Recommendation 2018-012 above and the other of which was as follows: that the Boeing Company promulgates to all 737 operators the information contained within this Special Bulletin and reminds them of previous similar occurrences reported in the Boeing 737 Flight Crew Operations Manual Bulletin dated December 2014. [2017-017]. The Final Report was issued on 21 November 2018.
