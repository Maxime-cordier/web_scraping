On 21 July 2017, a Boeing 737-800 (C-FWGH) being operated by Sunwing Airlines on behalf of Thompson Airways (since renamed TUI Airways) on a non-scheduled international passenger flight from Belfast International to Corfu as TOM1526 began its takeoff from intersection ‘D’ on runway 07 in day VMC. After using almost all the available 2654 metre TORA, the aircraft was observed climbing away at a very shallow angle over generally flat terrain. After just over 2 nm and approximately 800 feet aal, additional thrust was added, a normal rate of climb was established and thereafter the flight was completed without further event. The aircraft was subsequently found to have struck an approach light 36cm tall which was located 29 metres beyond the end of the runway, but to have been undamaged by this impact.
