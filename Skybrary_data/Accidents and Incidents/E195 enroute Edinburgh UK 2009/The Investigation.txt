The Findings were that: "Whilst the “smoke” was the initiating factor in this incident, it was the performance of some of the aircraft’s systems whilst the aircraft was on emergency power which caused serious concern amongst the crew. The PILOT function of the interphone system seemed, to the cabin crew, to indicate that it was functioning normally. However, the CAB pushbutton in the flight deck did not illuminate, and no voice contact was possible. The cabin crew did not attempt to use the EMER PILOT function, as this would involve an emergency call, which differed (in the cabin crewmembers’ perception) from the normal call only in the number of chimes. The ‘false positive’ indication of the PILOT call was crucial to the incident; had the PILOT call not appeared to function correctly, it is probable that the cabin crew, instead of contemplating incapacitation of the flight crew or serious emergency on the flight deck, would have attempted to establish communication using the EMER PILOT call. The operator’s operations manual did not detail the functioning of the interphone and flight deck access systems when the aircraft was on emergency power, and training had not made the crew aware of this functioning." A Special Bulletin S1/2009 was issued during the early stages of the investigation containing four Safety Recommendations to the aircraft manufacturer in respect of operation of the aircraft when supplied only with emergency electrical power. These Recommendations are replicated in the Final Report together with the aircraft manufacturer’s response.
