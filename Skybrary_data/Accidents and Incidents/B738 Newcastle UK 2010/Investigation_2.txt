but critical difference between the actual and reported surface conditions. In addition, it was considered that other factors that may have had an adverse effect on the actual versus expected landing distance besides the slightly late touchdown were the selection of reverse thrust to idle before a safe stop was assured and the decision prior to landing not to use maximum autobrake on the grounds that it was “not necessary” It was noted that all methods available to the crew at the time of the event which might have enabled them to gauge the likely braking action after landing on a runway at the time of the event were based on correlations between type and depth of contaminant and expected braking action. It was also noted that UK CAA had current documentation giving two contradictory definitions of ‘contamination’ of runway surfaces. The Conclusion of the Investigation was as follows: “The aircraft entered the stopway of Runway 07 at Newcastle Airport because the braking action on the runway was less than the pilots had anticipated. It is possible that there was a significant difference between the actual and reported conditions because the depth and type of contaminant on the runway was assessed visually. Touchdown of the aircraft beyond the normal touchdown zone, and selection of idle reverse thrust before the aircraft was at taxi speed, may have contributed to an increased landing distance.” Two Safety Recommendations were made a a result of the Investigation: That the CAA publishes a single definition of Contaminated Runways. [2011-087]. That the CAA develops a system of contaminant depth measurement that provides accurate and timely runway contamination information to enable pilots to determine the landing distance required. [2011-088]. The Final Report of the Investigation AAIB Bulletin: 2/2012 EW/C2010/11/05 was published on 9 February 2012.
