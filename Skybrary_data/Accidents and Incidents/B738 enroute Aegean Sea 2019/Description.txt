On 22 August 2019 the left engine of a CFM56-7 powered Boeing 737-800 (OK-TVO) being operated by Smartwings on an international passenger flight from Samos, Greece, to Prague as TVS 1125 failed soon after it reached the planned cruise level of FL360 in day VMC. A descent to FL240 was made and two relight attempts failed. The flight was nevertheless completed as originally intended without ATC awareness of single engine operation and passing many airports suitable for a precautionary diversion on the way with a ‘PAN’ only declared on entering Czech airspace.
