still only reducing through 158 knots. The actual touchdown position was also estimated to have been in excess of 600 metres past the runway landing threshold and almost 400 metres beyond the paint-marked aiming point. Since the crew stated that they had not realised that the aircraft had landed aligned with the edge of the runway or had then rolled for 300 metres partly or wholly off it before corrective action had been initiated, it was considered that two circumstances may have prevailed: The crew mistook the left-hand runway edge lights as runway centreline lights whereas no such lights are installed.. The shallow fog at the beginning of the runway degraded visual reference to the extent that the PF failed to notice the lateral deviation to the left.. The Investigation was unable to determine why the touchdown had been made aligned with the runway edge but formally confirmed that: The crew executed the instrument approach at a considerably excessive speed and only reduced the speed very late. At a distance of 2 nm before the runway threshold and at a flying altitude of 1,000 ft above ground, the ISA was still 43 knots above the recommended final approach speed. In doing so, the crew clearly deviated from the stabilised final approach principle.. Following a normal flare, the aircraft touched down in the snow to the left of the runway and rolled for approx. 300 metres along the left-hand edge of the runway, before making an abrupt turn to the right, back onto the runway.. There was shallow fog in the landing zone.. The surface of the runway was damp. The friction coefficient (FC) along the entire runway was such that good braking action could be achieved.. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed on 24 May 2018 and subsequently published on 18 September 2018. No Safety Recommendations were made.
