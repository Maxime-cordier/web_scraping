On 2 March 2018, a Cessna 525 (EC-KES) being operated by Taespejo on a non-scheduled international passenger flight from Lille to Bern as TES202 touched down aligned with the left hand side of the landing runway in reportedly normal visibility at night and the Captain took over and returned the aircraft to the runway it had briefly left altogether. Completion of the landing roll and taxi in then followed without further event but damage to the aircraft was found after passenger disembarkation and a runway inspection found broken edge lights and landing gear wheel tracks in the snow adjacent to the left hand edge of the runway.
