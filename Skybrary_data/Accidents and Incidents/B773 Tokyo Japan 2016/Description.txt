On 27 May 2016, the crew of a PW4090-engined Boeing 777-300 (HL7534) being operated by Korean Air Lines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Tokyo to Seoul as HL 2708 rejected takeoff on runway 34R because of a left engine fire warning and an emergency evacuation followed. Of the 319 occupants, 40 sustained minor injuries during the evacuation. Debris was ejected from the failed engine but none of it penetrated the fuselage.
