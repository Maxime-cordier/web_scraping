the engine after it had failed was likely to have been the result of impact forces generated by the release of a fragment from the ruptured rim part of the 1st stage HPT disc through the engine case and by the engine rundown loads generated when the engine stopped suddenly. These would have caused cracks to develop in the outer case of the Fuel Oil Heat Exchanger which would have allowed fuel and engine oil to leak into contact with the hot area of the engine case where ignition occurred.. NOTE - The above text on ‘Probable Causes’ has been completely reworded because of the loss of clarity in the translation of the Official Report into the English Language. Safety Action taken as a result of the findings of the Investigation prior to their publication were recorded as having included but not been limited to the following: On 9 March 2017, the FAA issued an AD in respect of PW4074, PW4077, PW4084 and PW4090 engines requiring an inspection of their 1st stage High Pressure Turbine Discs and their replacement in the event of a defect being found.. Pratt & Whitney changed its 1st stage High Pressure Turbine Disc manufacturing and product inspection processes.. Korean Airlines modified its Cabin Operations Manual in respect of passenger control during an emergency evacuation and modified its passenger safety video to better emphasise the prohibition on taking carry-on baggage when evacuating.. The Final Report was adopted by the JTSB on 6 July 2018 and published on 26 July 2018. No Safety Recommendations were made.
