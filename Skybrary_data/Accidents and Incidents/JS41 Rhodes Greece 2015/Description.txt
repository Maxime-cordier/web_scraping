On 2 February 2015, a BAE Jetstream 41 (SX-DIA) being operated by Sky Express on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Heraklion to Rhodes as SEH 100 failed to complete a normal landing on the 3000 metre-long runway 07 at destination following a non-precision approach in day VMC after the main landing gear partially collapsed causing the left wing and engine to drop onto the runway and the propeller to contact the runway. Both the aircraft and the runway surface were damaged, the former substantially, but none of the 19 occupants were injured.
