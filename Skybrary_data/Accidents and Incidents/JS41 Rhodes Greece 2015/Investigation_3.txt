in the Operations Manual Part ‘C’ stated that landing and takeoff at Rhodes was prohibited when the surface wind was between 110° and 180° and the speed exceeded 20 knots “due to associated severe horizontal and turbulent wind shear”. When comparing the conditions in which the approach had been flown with these SOPs, it was concluded that there had been significant non-compliance and it was found that the First Officer had failed to fulfil the duties of a PM under the principles of CRM to alert the PF Captain to this. The Probable Causes of the accident were determined to have been: The decision to perform a landing following a non-stabilised approach.. Landing with a strong and variable wind, the speed and the crosswind component of which were in excess of the values specified by the standard operating procedures, the aircraft manufacturer and the recommendations for the aerodrome involved contained in the AIP Greece.. The failure (of the flight crew) to adhere to CRM principles.. Two Safety Recommendations were made as follows: that Sky Express must review the wind limits in its Operations Manual having regard to the provisions of the AIP Greece.. that Sky Express must address the failure of its flight crew to adhere to CRM principles during the approach and in particular for the case in which a member of the flight crew also has senior management functions.. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed on 13 April 2018 and subsequently published in English language translation.
