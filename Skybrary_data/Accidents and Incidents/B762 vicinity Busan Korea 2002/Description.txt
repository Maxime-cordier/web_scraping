It was subsequently found to have impacted terrain 2.5nm to the north of the landing runway and been completely destroyed by the impact and post crash fire. 129 of the 166 occupants were killed and the 37 who survived were all seriously injured. Busan Airport was the civil transport element of Gimhae Air Force Base and ATS was a military responsibility.
