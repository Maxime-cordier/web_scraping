On 15 November 2013, a privately operated Cessna 310Q (G-BXUY) about to land on runway 22 at Hawarden UK in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) after a flight from Lognes-Emerainville, France was seen to deviate to the left of the runway and appeared to become unstable before it pitched up, rolled to the left and impacted the ground in a steep nose-down attitude. The two occupants were seriously injured and both died shortly afterwards. The aircraft was destroyed.
