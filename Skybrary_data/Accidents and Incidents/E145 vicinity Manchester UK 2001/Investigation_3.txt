necessary, initiate appropriate research into the aero-thermal disruption of intake flow and other effects of lightning strikes on fuselage-mounted turbine engines in order to establish whether there is a safety of flight issue that should be addressed by appropriate future rulemaking. They should also consider the application of any proposed rules to types currently in service. (2005-094). that Rolls-Royce Corporation should, with advances in the technology which become available to them, continue to explore the potential to make modifications to the FADEC logic to enable the re-establishment of stable running conditions, after detection of a surge condition, before the FADEC attempts to restore selected engine power. (2005-095). that Embraer should give consideration to amending the EMB 145 operating procedures and minimum equipment list to ensure that, in the event of an engine flame-out and continued flight in a zone with a high probability of lightning strikes, the supply of APU air for main engine starting remains available. (2005-096). The Final Report of the Investigation was published in November 2005.
