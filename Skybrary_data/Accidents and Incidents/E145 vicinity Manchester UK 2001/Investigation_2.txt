distance which the aircraft had moved through the air during that 5 or 6 seconds - estimated as around 500 metres - "should have carried it clear of any air directly affected by the lightning strike and thus restored the availability of acceptable intake conditions". It was concluded that the fact it had not done so implied that either the poor airflow conditions created by the strike had persisted within the intake, the engine itself or both, or that "the scheduled fuel control inputs made were optimised to restoring demanded power rather than ensuring that stable running conditions were obtained before restoring set power". The latter explanation would have been consistent with the effects on the FADEC of either "very hot, low density plasma passing into the engine" or "the large static charge associated with lightning discharges" especially on engine temperature sensing. It was considered that whilst engines with non-FADEC fuel scheduling "are more likely to suffer transient over-temperature conditions as an indirect result of a lightning strike" than engines with FADEC fuel scheduling, there may well be a higher chance that such engines would continue to run thereafter since the pilot retains more control over intentional shutdown. On the subject of engine restart below 10,000 feet following a FADEC-commanded shutdown, it was noted that although the windmill start requirement of N2 rotation below 10% would have been reached within 20 seconds, "an APU Bleed Air assisted start is required if the airspeed is below 220 knots" and requires that the APU be started first. It was considered that sufficient time to start the APU and then one engine may not necessarily be available and that certainly diving the aircraft to enter the unassisted re-start envelope would not be "a viable option". The fact that the APU was allowed to be inoperative for despatch under the MEL was considered pertinent, especially since FADEC shut down action is not communicated to the FADECs on the opposite engine and it is therefore possible for this type of FADEC to command shutdowns independently and simultaneously. However, it was also noted that a serviceable APU could be vulnerable to air disturbance-induced flame out from a lightning strike which had this effect on an engine. In respect of the risk that both engines might be shut down simultaneously as a consequence of the same lightning strike event, expert opinion sought during the Investigation suggested that all aircraft with fuselage-mounted or otherwise closely-spaced engines were theoretically vulnerable due to the possibility that propagation of such a disturbance could occur longitudinally down both sides of the fuselage. In the complete absence of hard evidence on the subject, it was suggested that this risk appeared to be "most prevalent on aircraft with narrow fuselages". Three Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that EASA, FAA and the Centro Tecnico Aeroespacial (CTA) of Brazil in conjunction with aircraft and engine manufacturers, should, in order to minimise the risk of uncommanded shut-downs, review and, if
