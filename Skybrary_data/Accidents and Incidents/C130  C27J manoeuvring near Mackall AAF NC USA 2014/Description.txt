On 1 December 2014 a USAF C-130H Hercules (T/N 88-4404) operating as PAKR32 and a US Army C-27J Spartan (T/N 10-27030) operating as GECKO33 had both departed Pope AAF on VFR training missions. The C27 had just taken off from an intermediate stop at Laurinburg-Maxton Airport. Approximately 8 miles south of Mackall AAF, they collided in Class ‘G’ airspace in night VMC. Both aircraft declared emergencies and recovered to Pope AAF and Mackall AAF respectively. There were no injuries to the total of thirteen crew members on board the aircraft but there was extensive damage to both aircraft.
