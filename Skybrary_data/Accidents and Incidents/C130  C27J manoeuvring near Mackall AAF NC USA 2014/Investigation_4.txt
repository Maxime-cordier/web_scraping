in the case of the right seat PF additionally by the combing-mounted Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The PF was also intentionally directing his scan to the right to clear for an imminent right turn. A general forward view of each aircraft’s flight deck and the views from all four positions towards the side where the opposite traffic was coming from are shown below. The Windshield of the C130 (left) and the C27 (right) showing the effect of aircraft structure on the view and in the case of the C130, the position of the PPI. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The Cause of the accident was found to be “a breakdown in visual scan resulting in insufficient clearing of the aircraft flight path by both aircrews”. The following Additional Findings were also identified: Both aircrews were over-reliant on TCAS to alert them to potential traffic conflicts and concentrate their visual scan.. Both aircrews exhibited complacency due to the routine nature of the mission profiles, despite the inherent risk associated with night, low-level, visual flight rules operations on Night Vision Goggles.. The visibility afforded by the C-27 is limited, presenting a considerably obstructed view for the left-seat pilot who was flying, limiting his ability to see the C-130 approaching from the right with sufficient time to avoid collision.. The pilot flying from the left seat of the C-130 channelised his attention on aircraft control resulting in a loss of situational awareness and breakdown of visual scan outside the aircraft.. The Final Report of the USAF AIB Investigation was approved on 12 March 2015 and subsequently made available without restriction.
