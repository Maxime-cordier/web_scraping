On 23 January 2020, a Cessna S550 (ZS-CAR) being operated by the Flight Inspection Unit (FIU) of the South Africa Civil Aviation Authority for instrument approach calibration flights departed George, which is at an altitude of 648 feet amsl, on a day VFR flight plan in order to make a series of calibration flights in respect of the runway 11 ILS at George. As it levelled off downwind at 3,900 feet QNH, almost 1000 feet higher than originally advised, radar contact was lost and only a single MAYDAY call was heard a few seconds later. The wreckage was subsequently located in mountainous terrain at 2,200 feet amsl with no survivors.
