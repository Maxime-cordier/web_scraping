On 24 July 2018, a Boeing 777-200 (HS-TJD) being operated by Thai Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Bangkok to Dhaka as TG 321 encountered adverse weather at its destination and after an unsuccessful first approach, the landing off the second one was followed by the right hand main landing gear being off the paved surface for part of the landing roll during which obstructions were encountered that severely damaged it. After finally leaving the runway onto an RET and stopping on it, aware that significant tyre damage must have occurred, the flight crew had not called TWR, who were unaware of the excursion due to restricted visibility until the next landing aircraft reported debris on the runway. There were no injuries to the 170 occupants but substantial damage was caused to the aircraft, the runway and installations in the vicinity of the right hand runway edge.
