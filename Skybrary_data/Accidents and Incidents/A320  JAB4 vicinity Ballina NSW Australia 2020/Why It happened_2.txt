fortuitous as the pilots of neither aircraft had been able to manage aircraft separation in the circumstances.. An Additional Factor that increased risk was also identified as: The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) review and periodic risk assessments of the airspace surrounding Ballina Airport did not include data for aircraft transiting the airspace without using the airport. Therefore, the risk associated with occurrences such as this one was not specifically considered when assessing the appropriate airspace classification. [Safety Issue]. Safety Action taken prior to the completion of the Investigation was noted as having included the following: CASA has expanded the Ballina Airport CTAF broadcast area to include the area where the investigated conflict occurred in order to “reduce residual airspace risk in the vicinity of Ballina”. It has also committed to developing an Airspace Risk Modelling System (ARMS) which, when implemented, is expected to “provide an enhanced capability to consider transiting aircraft using a historical database of flight trajectory data”.. ANSP Airservices Australia has introduced a Surveillance Flight Information Service (SFIS) which covers a 15 nm radius of Ballina and uses the former CTAF frequency and replaces the previous Ballina certified air/ground radio service. This service is available between 0700 and 1700 local time but is not a separation or sequencing service so pilots remain responsible for complying with all regulations and responsibilities which apply when in uncontrolled airspace and with relevant communications in respect of communication with other ground stations using the shared CTAF.. The Final Report was released on 25 March 2022. No Safety Recommendations were made.
