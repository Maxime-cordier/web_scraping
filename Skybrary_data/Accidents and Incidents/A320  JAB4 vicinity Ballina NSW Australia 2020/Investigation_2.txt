but they did not attempt to contact the traffic on the CTAF. Twenty three seconds prior to the aircraft crossing, a TCAS TA was generated and the crew continued their whilst maintaining their track. Three seconds prior to minimum separation between the two aircraft, the A320 advised the Bellina CA/GRO and the inbound 737 in their vicinity that they had just passed waypoint OPESO. The light aircraft pilot did not recall hearing this broadcast. Recorded flight data for both aircraft indicated that almost immediately after this transmission had been completed, the two aircraft had crossed in a position 12 nm south west of Ballina with the A320 beneath the light aircraft as illustrated on the illustration below. A reconstruction of the near miss flight paths. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The A320 crew reported having finally sighted the light aircraft immediately before assessing beneath it and the pilot of the light aircraft reported only sighting the A320 shortly after passing above it. The pilots in both aircraft did not observe any lateral separation as the crossing occurred.
