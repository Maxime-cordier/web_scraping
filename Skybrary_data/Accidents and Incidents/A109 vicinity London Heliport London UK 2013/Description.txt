On 16 January 2013, an Augusta 109E helicopter (G-CRST) owned by Castle Air was being operated by Rotormotion on a daylight positioning flight from Redhill to Elstree under callsign Rocket 2 prior to an intended revenue charter flight was unable to land at the intended destination due to freezing fog. The pilot subsequently requested and received acceptance for a diversion to the London Heliport when nearby. Shortly afterwards, it hit the jib of a crane on a high rise building under construction and the main body of the aircraft fell, with attendant debris, to the ground where the impact triggered an explosion and fire. The sole occupant of the helicopter and one other person on the ground were killed and several others were seriously injured.
