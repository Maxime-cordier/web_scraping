response following this conclusion has been focused on improving pre flight operational risk assessment for all helicopter operations, their response on the fitting of Helicopter Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (HTAWS), already required for turbine-powered fixed-wing aircraft with six or more passenger seats, has been limited to extending this requirement (with effect from April 2015) only to HEMS helicopters. The Investigation concluded that changes similar to the FAA requirements on pre-flight risk assessment and VFR flight planning should be considered in relation to the decision to accept a flight, to continue operation in adverse weather conditions, to low level flight in the vicinity of terrain or obstacles and in the case of "short notice or en route changes to flight objectives and planning". It was considered too that a process such as the EHEST Pre-departure Risk Assessment Tool and in the particular case of the accident being investigated, the existence of a version applicable to single pilot passenger transport flights, might also have positive safety benefits. It was considered that the use of such a tool might have prompted the pilot of the accident helicopter to seek management approval before accepting the flight and that its use might also have resulted in the two elevated risk factors identified by the Investigation being recognised and corresponding risk-mitigation being put in place before any departure. The Investigation also took the view that the case for restricting the requirement for HTAWS to HEMS operations was not clear given the circumstances in which this accident had occurred and that HTAWS may well be an equally beneficial safety improvement in respect of UK commercial helicopter operations. In respect of any regulatory changes which would require action at the European level, there was a concern that whilst European regulations are routinely reviewed against those in the US for standardisation purposes, the process of rulemaking in Europe requires "a review and consultation period of typically five years or more prior to implementation" whereas "some of the changes made by the FAA are directly relevant to this accident and could provide immediate safety benefits". The Investigation formally identified two Causal Factors relevant to the Accident: The pilot turned onto a collision course with the crane attached to the building and was probably unaware of the helicopterâ€™s proximity to the building at the beginning of the turn.. The pilot did not see the crane or saw it too late to take effective avoiding action.. One Contributory Factor was also identified: The pilot continued with his decision to land at the London Heliport despite being unable to remain clear of cloud.. Ten Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Civil Aviation Authority require UK Air Navigation Service Providers to assess the effect of obstacles, notified through the UK Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control cycle, on operational procedures relating to published VFR routes near those obstacles, and modify procedures to enable pilots to comply simultaneously with ATC instructions, and the Air Navigation Order and
