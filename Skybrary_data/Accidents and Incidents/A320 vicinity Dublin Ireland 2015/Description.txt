On 3 October 2015, an Airbus A320 (EI-DVJ) operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Dublin to Munich had just taken off when noxious fumes became apparent throughout the aircraft and a 'smoke-like effect' was observed in the cabin. The effects fluctuated but continued and a PAN for an air turnback was declared to ATC with the pilots donning oxygen masks as a precaution. The aircraft landed back at Dublin just over 20 minutes later and after an unexpected delay due to absence of ground staff, the doors were opened and all occupants were disembarked. The episode had no identifiable injurious effects on the 148 passengers or 6 crew members.
