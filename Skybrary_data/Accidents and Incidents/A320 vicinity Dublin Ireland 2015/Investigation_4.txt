available to ensure the prompt positioning of an air bridge or mobile passenger steps, which due to the presence of fumes on board the aircraft, would have been appropriate". The Investigation formally determined that the Probable Cause of the occurrence was "the presence of corrosion inhibitor in the Intermediate Pressure (IP) bleed ducts and IP engine bleed ducts following an engine wash procedure, leading to contamination of the air conditioning system". Three Contributory Factors were also identified as follows: Corrosion inhibitor was erroneously added to the water tanks of the engine wash rig.. The Operator did not have an engine wash training programme in place prior to the occurrence and therefore neither Engineer had received training in engine wash procedures.. The alternative post engine wash test did not result in any adverse findings; this test was only applicable if the engines were washed with pure water.. Safety Action taken as a result of the occurrence included the following by the Aircraft Operator, both of which meant that Safety Recommendations were not made in either regard: An engine wash training programme for its engineers was developed and introduced and the circumstances of the investigated event were added to their engineers' Human Factors Training.. A review of the delay in positioning the air bridge was followed by action to "enhance the efficacy of their response to aircraft returning due to fumes or other situations where a prompt disembarkation would be desirable".. The Final Report was published on 14 February 2017.
