On 1 June 2019, a Boeing 737-800 (I-NEOT) being operated by Neos on a scheduled international passenger flight from Verona to Bristol was instructed to discontinue its day VMC non precision approach as it reached MDA because it was considered to be dangerously low. It commenced a go around but after climbing less than 300 feet then began to descend over the runway reaching 457 feet agl before resuming its climb. Radar vectoring to a second approach followed without further event.
