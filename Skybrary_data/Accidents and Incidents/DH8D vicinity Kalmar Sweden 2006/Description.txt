On 6 April 2006, an incorrect response to a propeller malfunction, by the crew of an SAS Dash-8-Q400, resulted in an unstable single engine approach, and operation of the remaining engine outside limits. The aircraft landed safely at Kalmar, Sweden. The following is an extract from the History of Flight in the SHK Report on the accident: "At this point the power situation of the engines was extremely asymmetrical, with -6% Tq from the right engine and 125 % Tq from the left engine. Printouts of the information recorded by the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) show that the maximum aileron and rudder deflection was used to be able to control the aircraft in this configuration. At a later point in the approach the commander asked “Why have we…?” The first officer answered: “We haven’t feathered - that’s why”."
