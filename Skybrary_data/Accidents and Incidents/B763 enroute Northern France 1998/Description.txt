The following is an extract from the UK AAIB Report on the Accident: "Whilst in cruising flight near Paris during an ETOPS flight from Zurich to Washington DC, abnormal warnings appeared on the flight deck instrumentation and circuit breakers began tripping. The commander, in consultation with the operatorâ€™s maintenance control centre at London Heathrow Airport, decided to divert and land at Heathrow. The aircraft subsequently landed safely, but during the landing ground roll the right thrust reverser failed to deploy fully and smoke appeared at the forward end of the passenger cabin. As a result, the commander ordered an evacuation when the aircraft was on the taxiway, adjacent to the landing runway. The right off-wing escape slide failed to deploy and alternative slides were used. Several minor injuries occurred during the evacuation."
