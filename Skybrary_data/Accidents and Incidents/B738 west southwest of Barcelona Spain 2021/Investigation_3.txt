temporary speed variations of between 10 and 15 knots may occur. It stated that in the event of severe turbulence, use of the AP is “optional” with a speed of 0.76 Mach/280 knots maintaining a constant pitch attitude with wings level thus permitting variations in altitude and warned explicitly that “flight control systems should not be subjected to sudden large inputs”. The FCTM was found to recommend that in the event of unexpected overspeed, “the autopilot should remain engaged unless it is clear that it is not correcting the overspeed event”. It also warned that “disengaging the autopilot to prevent or reduce the severity of an accidental overspeed event can result in abrupt changes to the pitch angle”. The operator’s procedures for cabin crew stated that they should not wait to receive a warning from the flight crew before ceasing their activities if they consider that the level of turbulence is such that they should cease their activities and secure themselves in their seats. The Probable Cause of the accident was formally documented as "the series of actions taken by the PF to prevent the aircraft from exceeding the VMO while it was flying through an area of turbulence which resulted in vertical acceleration that caused severe injuries to a passenger and two cabin crew members”. The Final Report of the Investigation was approved on 30 March and subsequently published simultaneously in the definitive Spanish language and in an English language translation on 22 June 2022. No Safety Recommendations were made.
