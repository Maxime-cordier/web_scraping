On 31 July 2021, a Boeing 737-800 (EI-EPC) being operated by Ryanair on a scheduled international passenger flight from Fez to Barcelona and in a daylight descent passing FL180 in an area of forecast moderate turbulence encountered a two minute episode of convective turbulence close to storm clouds but still in VMC. When the indicated airspeed increased towards Vmo, the autopilot was disconnected and an abrupt manual pitch up followed immediately by an equally abrupt pitch down led to serious injuries to two of the cabin crew and one of the 172 passengers. The three injured individuals were taken to hospital by ambulance on arrival.
