of its contribution to the failure sequence. Also, whether any other factors may have contributed to the loss of tail rotor control remains under review. The following Safety Actions consequent upon the findings of the Investigation so far are known to have been taken: On 5 November 2018, Leonardo, the manufacturer of the helicopter, issued an ASB (Alert Service Bulletin) for the AW169 requiring precautionary inspection of the tail rotor control assembly on all in-service aircraft. The following day, an ASB for the same inspection on all in-service AW189 aircraft, which has a similar tail rotor control system to the AW169, was issued. On 7 November, the EASA, which had regulatory responsibility for both types, issued a corresponding AD to formally mandate these inspections. On 19 November, this AD was replaced by another requiring a precautionary one-time inspection of the tail rotor duplex bearing and, depending on findings, applicable corrective actions.. On 21 November 2018, Leonardo issued ASBs for both AW169 and AW189 helicopters giving further instructions for a one-time inspection of the tail rotor duplex bearing and on the same day, the EASA replaced its 19 November AD with one mandating this inspection.. On 30 November, Leonardo issued Emergency ASBs for both AW169 and AW189 helicopters which introduced repetitive inspections of the castellated nut that secures the tail rotor actuator control shaft to the actuator lever mechanism and the tail rotor duplex bearing. Again, EASA issued an AD mandating these inspections the same day.. Two Special Bulletins, upon which this summary is based have been issued, the first on 14 November 2018 and the second on 6 December 2018. The AAIB have stated that further Bulletins will be issued if there is significant interim information to communicate before the Investigation has been completed.On 27 October 2019, the AAIB stated that their detailed Final Report of this investigation would be published during 2020
