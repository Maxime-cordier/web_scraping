On 7 June 2018, a Boeing 737-800 (EI-FHZ) being operated by Norwegian Air International on an international passenger flight from Alicante to Oslo as IBK2WH was on its takeoff roll on runway 10 in good day visibility when ATC instructed it to stop the takeoff due to vehicles on the runway ahead. This was promptly accomplished with the aircraft reaching a maximum of 88 knots ground speed. The 3000 metre-long runway was cleared about half way along its length with separation between the oncoming vehicles never less than 1000 metres.
