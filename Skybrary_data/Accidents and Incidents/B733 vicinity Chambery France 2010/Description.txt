On 7 February 2010, a Boeing 737-300 being operated by Jet2 on a scheduled passenger flight from Leeds/Bradford UK to Chambery France was making an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to runway 18 at destination in day Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) when a Mode 2 Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) ‘Terrain, Pull Up’ Warning occurred. A climb was immediately initiated to Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) on top and a second ILS approach was then made uneventfully. Despite extreme pitch during the early stages of the pull up climb, none if the 109 occupants, all secured for landing, were injured.
