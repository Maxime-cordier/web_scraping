to the right of the runway centreline.. During the landing roll, the attention of the Pilot Monitoring was focused on the lateral drift and, as a result, the required callouts regarding the position of the deceleration devices were not made.. The pilot flying focused on controlling the lateral deviation and, without the benefit of the landing roll callouts, did not recognise that all of the deceleration devices were not fully deployed and that the autobrake was disengaged.. Although manual brake application began 8 seconds after touchdown, maximum braking effort did not occur until 15 seconds later, when the aircraft was 245 metres from the end of the runway. At this position, it was not possible for the aircraft to stop on the runway and, 5 seconds later, the aircraft departed the end of the runway at a speed of 77 knots and came to a stop 270 metres past the end of the runway.. During the overrun, the aircraft crossed a significant 2.8 metre gulley approximately 166 metres past the end of the runway and was damaged beyond repair. While this uneven terrain was beyond the 150 metre RESA proposed by Transport Canada, it was within the recommended ICAO 300 metre-long RESA.. One Finding as to Risk was also formally recorded as follows: If the pilot monitoring does not call out approach conditions or approach speed increases, the pilot flying might not make corrections, increasing the risk of a runway overrun.. Two Other Findings were also formally recorded: There was no reverted rubber hydroplaning and almost certainly no dynamic hydroplaning during this occurrence.. Although viscous hydroplaning can be expected on all wet runways, when maximum braking effort was applied, the aircraft braking was consistent with the expected braking on runway 14 under the existing wet runway conditions.. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 21 April 2021 and it was officially released on 29 June 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
