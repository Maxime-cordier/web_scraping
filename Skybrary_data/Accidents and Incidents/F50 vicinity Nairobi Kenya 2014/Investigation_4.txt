been carried was received and prepared for aircraft loading was inconclusive and it appeared that even Air Way Bills (AWB) were not prepared on a per flight basis. In any case, ATC confirmed that three of the operator’s cargo only flights had departed Nairobi on the day of the accident but copies of only two AWBs were available. The Probable Cause of the accident was determined as “the decision by the crew to conduct the flight with a known mechanical problem and their failure to abort or reject the takeoff after receiving twenty seven cautions”. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed on 26 November 2019 and subsequently published. No Safety Recommendations were made and no resulting Safety Action was recorded.
