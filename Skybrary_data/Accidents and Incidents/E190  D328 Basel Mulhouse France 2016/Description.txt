On 7 March 2016, an Embraer 190 (PH-EXB) being operated by KLM Cityhopper on a scheduled international passenger flight from Basel Mulhouse to Amsterdam as KLM1986 entered the departure runway in normal daylight ground visibility just as a Dornier 328 (HB-AEO) being operated by SKYWork on a domestic passenger flight from Basel Mulhouse to Bern as SRK51R was taking off in the opposite direction. ATC only recognised the conflict when it was too late to resolve it by further instructions but fortunately, the other aircraft was just able to overfly the incursion aircraft after a late sighting of it.
