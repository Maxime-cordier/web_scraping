On 28 April 2018, a Dassault Falcon F900EX (I-TARH) being operated by the Chicago Jet Group on a positioning flight from Catania to Bremgarten with just the flight crew on board positioned onto a tailwind final approach to runway 23 at destination in day VMC without contacting the AFISO. It then continued an unstabilised approach which generated multiple EGPWS warnings to a landing which forced a Beech B36T Bonanza (D-EBCF) on short final to the runway in use 05 to break off its approach and initiate avoiding action overflying the F900 as it touched down by 225 feet.
