An Investigation of ATC communications was carried out by the German Federal Bureau of Accident Investigation (BFU). The F900 was not fitted with a FDR nor required to be but the 2 hour CVR was “seized” but relevant data was only found on channels 2 (right seat pilot) and 4 (area microphone) and this was successfully downloaded. Useful recorded ATC radar data from Strasbourg was provided by the French ANSP and recorded R/T communications (in German) were provided by Bremgarten and (in English) by Zurich ACC, the last frequency worked by the F900 before landing at Bremgarten. The F900 flight crew consisted of a 52 year-old Captain with an FAA-issued ATPL (airline transport pilot licence) who had a total of 13,015 hours flying experience of which “about 2,235 hours” were on type and a 43 year-old Co-pilot, also with an FAA-issued ATPL, who had a total of 12,610 hours flying experience of which 1,652 hours were on type. The 70 year-old Beech 36TC pilot held a German-issued PPL and had recorded a total of 2,902 hours flying experience up to a date four weeks after the investigated event had occurred. With the Beech 36TC already in contact with the Bremgarten AFISO and established on final approach for the runway in use 05, the Dassault F900, with the Captain acting as PF, called on a no longer used Bremgarten frequency (122.0 MHz) that it was on final approach to runway 23 prefacing the call with “Bremgarten Control”. This call was made one minute before the subsequent touchdown. Twenty five seconds after this, the F900 gear warning was annunciated followed approximately 15 seconds later - 10 seconds before touchdown - by four EGPWS ‘Sink Rate’ warnings. The landing checklist was completed at 100 feet agl after which the PF first noticed the opposite traffic - the Beech 36 - and exclaimed “guy is coming right at us”. The Beech 36 pilot saw the F900 and decided that an immediate avoidance manoeuvre was appropriate and initiated a climb and then a left turn which resulted in him overflying the F900 as it touched down. It was noted that as Bremgarten was only approved for use by aircraft with an MTOW not exceeding 20 tonnes, the intended use of the aerodrome by a Falcon 900EX (MTOW 22,226kg) required that an exceptional authorisation must be issued in advance by the appropriate regulatory authority, in this case, the Stuttgart Roads and Traffic Regional Council acting in accordance with the German Federal Aviation Act and the sections 18 & 24 of the German Aviation Regulation. This had been done and permitted the specific aircraft advised to make one landing and one take off during the period 28-30 April 2018.

It was found that despite the relatively long en-route flight time of the F900, no attempt
