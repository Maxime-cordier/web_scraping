On 24 April 2005, an Airbus A340-200 (ZS-SLA) being operated on a scheduled passenger flight from Johannesburg to Perth landed short of the displaced threshold on runway 21 at destination in normal day visibility. There was no damage to the aircraft or to fixed equipment on the ground although a warning cone was damaged by impact with the aircraft. It was noted that the aircraft was being operated with an augmented crew.
