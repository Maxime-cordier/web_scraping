On 25 February 2013, a Boeing 737-800 (VH-VYE) being operated by Qantas Airways on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Canberra to Brisbane at night was in the cruise at FL 390 when the aircraft unexpectedly began to climb. The autopilot was disconnected and a descent back to the cleared level was commenced but after the crew subsequently believed that the autopilot had been re-engaged when it had not, the aircraft rolled left and also deviated from track. Control was subsequently regained and the remainder of the flight was uneventful.
