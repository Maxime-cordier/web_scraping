by either pilot until the unexpected climb was in progress given that "Qantas procedures provided an opportunity for the crew to detect the armed mode as the aircraft levelled at FL 390 as well as time available in the cruise between the inadvertent selection and the aircraft climbing". The Investigation referred to the 2013 Report of the PARC/CAST Automation Working Group which found that incomplete compliance with procedural requirements to cross-verify FMS entries is commonplace in normal line operations. In respect of the subsequent lack of AP status awareness on the part of both pilots, the Investigation considered that "given that they had just dealt with what they thought was another autopilot-related issue, the crew thought they were dealing with a second autopilot-related issue" and that it was "therefore not surprising that they took some time to realise that they were actually dealing with the autopilot not being engaged". However, in respect of actual risk in this particular case, it was noted that "there were a number of other risk controls in place to help detect a more significant problem, such as an aural ‘Bank Angle’ alert if the bank angle exceeded 35°, ATC monitoring of the aircraft’s flight path and flight crew training in recovery from unusual attitudes". In respect of the fact that the investigated event had been on the last sector of a four-sector duty day of over 11 hours and had occurred at night, it was noted that whilst the captain’s prior roster "met the relevant requirements and did not appear to be unduly problematic" the Captain reported an average of 10 hours work unrelated to their flying employment on non flying days. The view was taken that "this level of work has the potential to lead to cumulative fatigue and interfere with a person’s ability to ensure that they are getting adequate rest periods between rostered flight duty periods" but that "it is very difficult for an operator to control such activities" and that there is therefore "a significant onus on the crew member to ensure that they are appropriately rested prior to reporting for duty". The Investigation formally identified four Contributory Factors as follows: Depending on the auto-flight and instrument landing system frequency selections by the flight crew, the configuration of the auto-flight system logic on the operator's Boeing 737 fleet allowed the aircraft to capture and follow a glideslope signal despite not being established on the localiser.. The flight crew inadvertently selected the approach push-button after reaching cruising altitude, which was not detected for an extended period, allowing the aircraft's auto-flight system to capture the glideslope signal at cruise altitude while still about 213 km from the destination.. Following departure from Canberra the instrument landing system frequency for that airport, which was the same as for the system at Brisbane Airport, remained active on the aircraft’s navigation control panel, permitting the auto-flight system to capture and follow the glideslope signal as the aircraft approached Brisbane.. Contrary to their intent, the flight crew did
