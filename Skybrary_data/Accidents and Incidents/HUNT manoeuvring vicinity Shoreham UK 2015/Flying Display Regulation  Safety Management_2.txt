AMC "requires the competent authority to ensure that the resulting level of safety is acceptable", it was noted that "the CAA has not provided any risk assessments or other relevant documentation to support its decision to issue the exemption" but stated instead that this exemption "had been in place since at least 1996 and there was no evidence to suggest that these rules were inherently unsafe". In respect of the environment within which flying displays take place, it was observed that whilst "every display site has constraints and limitations...the area surrounding Shoreham (Airport) is particularly congested" with almost half the surface area within 2000 metres of the ARP which consisted of major roads, housing, industrial or recreational areas. There were also areas where 'secondary spectators' were known to gather "despite the display organiserâ€™s efforts to reduce numbers to address the hazard of road traffic to these crowds (and) a large bulk fuel storage area 500 metres from the north-east end of the display line". It was clear that "the risk assessment for the Shoreham Airshow had not considered how individual display aircraft would operate within the constraints of the surrounding area" despite the fact that most UK flying display accidents "occur underneath the volume of airspace in which the aircraft is manoeuvring and, in more than half of cases, in areas outside the control of the display organiser". No evidence was found that "the suitability of the specific display sequences intended for the 2015 Airshow" had been considered in relation to either "the environment surrounding Shoreham or their effect on uninvolved third parties". It was concluded that both at Shoreham and at similar displays elsewhere at the time of the accident, "there was no specific requirement to separate the displaying aircraft from uninvolved third parties". The CAA "considered that separation from third parties would be managed via the risk assessment process" yet at the time, they did not routinely review display risk assessments. The Investigation also found that "the display separation distances required at the time would not have protected the 'on-airport' crowd from predictable scenarios" either.
