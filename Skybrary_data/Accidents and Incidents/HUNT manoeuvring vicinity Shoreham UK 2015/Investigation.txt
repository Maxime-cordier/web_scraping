Special Bulletin 4/2015, published on 21 December 2015, dealt with the safety of first responders to the accident scene, the maintenance of ejection seats in historic ex-military aircraft and issues regarding the maintenance of ex-military aircraft on the UK civil register.. Safety Bulletin 1/2016, published on 10 March 2016, considered the risk management of flying displays, minimum display heights and separation distances, regulatory oversight and piloting standards. It was published to inform the air display community of important issues identified ahead of the 2016 air display season.. A variety of recorded data was assembled from a range of sources and careful analysis of it provided useful factual information which helped inform the analysis. The aircraft itself was not fitted with a FDR and was not required to be. A small UAV fitted with a gyro-stabilised camera able to take 14 megapixel stills and 1080p resolution video was used to obtain aerial images and video of the accident site. The still images were "processed using photogrammetry software to generate a 3D model and orthomosaic images of the accident site".
