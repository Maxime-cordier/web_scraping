The Investigation identified a range of issues relating to the continued airworthiness of the 60 year-old ex-military aircraft which in various respects had not been properly addressed by either the Maintenance and Repair Organisation or the Regulator. These issues were not central to the causation of the accident but nevertheless considered indicative of an unsatisfactory context for the operation of aircraft such as the Hawker Hunter. There was one particular concern in respect of the risk to accident site first responders arising from the partially 'live' status of the ejection seat which were indirectly related to its condition (unused) in the wreckage. Overall, the Investigation found that the accident aircraft had not been "in compliance with relevant airworthiness requirements" in a number of respects including limitations exceeded and not reported and defects not recorded yet "despite CAA oversight during the relevant period, a Permit to Fly - Certificate of Validity had been issued (for the aircraft) on more than one occasion".
