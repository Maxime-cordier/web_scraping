thrust levers were left as they were when the A/T was switched off”, a low thrust setting but not idle. The Cause of the event was determined to have been “mistakes made by both pilots in crew coordination and in flight path control during both the approach to land in adverse weather conditions and during the subsequent failure to follow the prescribed go-around procedures”. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Bulgarian Air Charter must organize and carry out an additional theoretical CRM training course and the pilots who have caused the Serious Incident must undergo a flight simulator proficiency check. [BG.SIA-2018/08/01]. that Bulgarian Air Charter must ensure that the next flight simulator training session for all their MD-82 pilots includes an exercise with similar conditions for flight performance as in the case of the investigated Serious Incident. [BG.SIA-2018/08/02]. The Final Report was released in early June 2020.
