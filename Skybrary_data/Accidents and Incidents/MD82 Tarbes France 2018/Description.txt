On 16 January 2018, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 (LZ-LDM) being operated by Bulgarian Air Charter on a non-scheduled international passenger flight from Catania to Tarbes as BUC8115 became unstable below 500 feet in day VMC but descent was continued until just above the runway elevation before a go around was commenced. However, although the aircraft was rotated, the corresponding climb did not commence for a further mile during which the airspeed almost reached that at which a stall would have occurred. In the event, control was regained just in time and a diversion to Toulouse followed without further event.
