thrust following touchdown so as to realign with the runway centreline, although in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practice, had increased the required stopping distance. It was considered that the decision to carry out a pilot-flown-approach, rather than a pilot-monitored-approach at night and in heavy rain, probably contributed to the excess airspeed that was maintained until touchdown. No indication that an aircraft system malfunction had contributed to the accident outcome was found and the focus of the Investigation therefore moved to an analysis of the factual aspects of the landing made and the prevailing environmental context.
