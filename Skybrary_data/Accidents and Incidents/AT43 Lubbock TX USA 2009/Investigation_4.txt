requirements. Such simulation training should emphasize the following: cues for recognizing changes in the aircraft’s flight characteristics as airframe icing develops; procedures for monitoring and maintaining appropriate airspeeds in icing conditions, including the use of icing airspeed reference indices; and procedures for responding to decaying airspeed situations, stall protection system activation, and early stalls that can occur without stall protection system activation.
