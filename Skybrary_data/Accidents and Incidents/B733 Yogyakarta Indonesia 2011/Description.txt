On 20 December 2011, a Boeing 737-300 (PK-CKM) being operated by Indonesian carrier Sriwijaya Air on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Jakarta to Yogyakarta as SJ230 diverted to Surabaya because of poor weather and subsequently, after refuelling, flew from Surabaya to Yogyakarta. Since the Instrument Landing System (ILS) was promulgated out of service by Notice To Airmen, a non-precision approach was flown in daylight to a visual transition. However, this was followed by a bounced touchdown at excessive speed on the wet runway and the aircraft ran off the end at a significant speed before coming to a stop over 80 metres beyond the paved surface. The landing gear partially collapsed and an emergency evacuation was carried out during which 6 of the 137 occupants sustained minor injuries. Some runway lighting and signage was damaged by aircraft impact.
