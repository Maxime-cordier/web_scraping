The landing technique used by the pilot flying reduced much of the excess speed during the flare and contributed to the increase in landing distance.. The wet runway and the rubber accumulation on the runway created conditions conducive to viscous hydroplaning, thereby contributing to the increase in stopping distance.. The automatic braking system was set to minimum, which contributed to the increase in stopping distance. The recommended setting was medium..
