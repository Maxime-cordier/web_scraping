The runway friction coefficient indicated that the runway was slippery when wet, but this information was not provided to the pilots. This information might have prompted the flight crew to request a longer runway or use medium automatic braking rather than minimum.. The flight crew did not use the tables for calculating landing distance; consequently, they did not feel it was necessary to request a longer runway for the landing.. Aéroports de Montréal (ADM) did not follow Transport Canada's recommendations to issue a notice to airmen (Notice To Airmen) indicating that the runway could be slippery when wet. The flight crew was thus deprived of key information.. While crossing the runway threshold and during much of the landing roll, the aircraft was subjected to an average tailwind component of about 15 knots, thereby increasing the stopping distance..
