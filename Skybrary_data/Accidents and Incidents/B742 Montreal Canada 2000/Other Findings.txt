Transport Canada and ADM have different interpretations of paragraph 2.5.2.2 of Aerodrome Standards and Recommended Practices (TP312) as to the action required at certain runway friction levels.. It was noted that removal of rubber deposits from the accident runway surface was effected on 23 August 2000 by a contractor hired by ADM and that this restored the reference friction coefficient to above the required standard. This report concludes the Transportation Safety Board's investigation into this occurrence. Consequently, the Board authorized the release of this report on 30 August 2001. The release of the Final Report of the Investigation was authorised on 30 August 2001 and it may seen in full at SKYbrary bookshelf: Aviation Investigation Report A00Q0094 No Safety Recommendations were made.
