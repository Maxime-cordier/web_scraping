On 10 May 2010 in normal day visibility, a Boeing 767-300 being operated by ANA on a domestic scheduled passenger flight from Fukuoka to Okinawa was cleared to line up and take off on runway 16 for which, a minute earlier, a landing clearance had been issued to another scheduled domestic passenger flight, a DHC8-400 being operated by Japan Air Commuter and inbound to Fukuoka from Miyazaki. ATC were unaware of the error until a request was made by the DHC8 to confirm their landing clearance prompted by hearing a line up and take off clearance being given to the departing aircraft. The approaching aircraft, which was Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) at the time, was instructed to go around and the clearance for the departing aircraft clearance was changed to ‘line up and wait’ so that there was no actual risk of collision.
