On 6 February 2013, an Airbus A320-200 (G-EUUK) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled passenger flight from London to Helsinki under callsign BAW79H was instructed to go around from an approach to runway 04L at destination by ATC. An Embraer 190 (OH-LKO) being operated by Flybe Finland on a scheduled passenger flight from Warsaw to Helsinki under callsign FCM746K and ahead of the A320 on the same approach was then obliged to also commence a go around due to no landing clearance being issued. Having been instructed to fly runway heading, the Embraer 190 then did so on a track which was abeam that of a Boeing 717-200 (OH-BLQ) being operated by Blue1 on a scheduled passenger flight from Helsinki to Stockholm under callsign SAS717 which had just taken off from the parallel runway. Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) activations occurred as the proximity between the Embraer 190 and the other two aircraft reduced and loss of the prescribed minimum separation subsequently occurred against both of them. The conflictions occurred in day Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC).
