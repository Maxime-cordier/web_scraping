On 21 January 2011, a Bombardier CRJ200 being operated by Belarusian AL on a scheduled passenger flight from Minsk to Stockholm carried out a missed approach from runway 26 at destination at night in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) from a low height. After failing to follow the prescribed missed approach track, it came into proximity in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) with a BAe ATP being operated by Swedish airline Nextjet on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Stockholm to Lycksele which had just departed from runway 19R. No abrupt manoeuvres resulted and none of the respective 36 and 26 occupants of the two aircraft were injured.
