have been taken by DJI whilst the Investigation was in progress was noted as having included ceasing production of the UA model involved in the accident and replacing it with one which had a battery safety clip and which displayed wind speed on the controller app. A total of 4 Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that DJI amend the DJI Pilot and DJI GO4 apps to warn the remote pilot when the wind limit has been exceeded and that the UA should be landed as soon as possible. [2022-001]. that DJI amend the DJI Pilot and DJI GO4 apps so that an aural alert is triggered when alert messages relating to safety of flight appear. [2022-002]. that DJI amend the Matrice 200 series User Manual to provide information on the pitch attitude limiting system, including the new maximum speed which results from the limit, and the battery level at which it triggers; and communicate this change widely to pilots and operators. [2021-003]. that the Civil Aviation Authority review the Visual Line of Sight distance figures in CAP 722 and amend the guidance to make it clear that just being able to see an unmanned aircraft is not sufficient for Visual Line of Sight operations and that pilots need to be able to demonstrate that at the distance they are flying, they can manoeuvre it rapidly to avoid a collision and can also land the unmanned aircraft safely following a loss of position-holding without reference to video or telemetry. [2021-004]. In respect of the final Safety Recommendation, it was observed that whilst the issues identified with the VLOS guidance in CAP 722 “were not a direct factor in this accident [...] the guidance should be improved to help reduce the chance of other types of VLOS fly away accident which could result in injuries to people”. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 7 April 2022. Related Articles UAS. Loss of Control. UAS Rules and Guidance (EU).
