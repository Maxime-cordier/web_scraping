On 19 November 2020, control of a DJI Matrice M210 UA being flown operationally by the Police over the city of Poole was lost when it drifted beyond visual line of sight (VLOS) in day VMC and communication was lost. The UA was subsequently found to have crashed into a house in autoland mode and sustained damage. Although no personal injury was involved, the accident outcome was considered to indicate that such a risk existed in the event of loss of control over a populated area.
