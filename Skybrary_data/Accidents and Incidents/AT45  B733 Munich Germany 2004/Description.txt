During the hours of darkness at Munich on 3 May 2004, an ATR42-500 was given a conditional line up clearance for Runway 08R but contrary to this clearance then taxied onto that runway as a Boeing 737-300 was landing on it. The landing aircraft missed the right wingtip of the ATR-42, which continued taxing onto the runway as it approached, by “a few metres”.
