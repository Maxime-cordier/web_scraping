the suspect blade found that it had accumulated 2,979 cycles since its most recent inspection and had undergone TAI inspections in 2014 and 2016. It was noted that the TAI inspection data from 2016 was examined again in 2018 because of a 2018 in flight fan blade failure in another PW4077 engine installed on another United Airlines Boeing 777-200 which was attributed to Pratt and Whitneyâ€™s failure to adequately specify fan blade integrity checking procedures. The Investigation intends to review the 2016 inspection records to examine the presence and disposition of any anomalies in their TAI data in the vicinity of the identified fracture initiation point. An Investigative Update detailing initial findings from the Investigation and on which this summary is based was released on 5 March 2021.
