On 20 February 2021, a Boeing 777-200 (N772UA) being operated by United Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Denver to Honolulu as UA 328 had been airborne for about four minutes and was in day VMC when there was an uncontained failure of the right engine following which the associated fire did not fully extinguish in response to the prescribed drill. Large pieces of engine debris fell on a populated area of the city but there were no injuries. An emergency was declared and a return to land at Denver was followed by the engine fire being fully extinguished before the aircraft was towed off the runway and the 239 occupants were disembarked. The airframe sustained only minor damage.
