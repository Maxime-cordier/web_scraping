Two USAF-operated McDonnell Douglas F15E fighter aircraft declared as operating as a formation were pulling up from low level after encountering potential delays at their intended post-exercise destination due to deteriorating weather in preparation for a diversion. Despite being cleared to FL150 only, both continued to climb and both passed through the level of an Embraer 145 being operated by British Airways Regional on a scheduled passenger flight from Birmingham to Hannover, one seen at an estimated range of 100 feet. The aircraft were on different ATC control frequencies, being Operational Air Traffic (OAT) and General Air Traffic (GAT) respectively.
