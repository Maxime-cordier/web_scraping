On 31 October 2012, an ATR42-500 being operated by Czech Airlines on an airworthiness function flight in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) entered a full stall during a planned test of only the functioning of the Stall Protection System. Recovery was achieved from the resultant unusual attitude and again after a subsequent and similar full stall followed by a more effective recovery response, the remainder of the 85 minute function flight was completed without further event.
