during a low speed test flight when the crew was intentionally reducing speed until the stall speed in spite of the Stick Shaker/Stick Pusher (caused by the freezing of the AOA sensors) not being activated. The blocked AOA sensors caused the consequent inoperability of the Stall Protection System (Stall Warning, Stick Shaker/Stick Pusher). It is very likely that water penetrated the AOA sensors during pressure water cleansing of the aircraft coating without sufficient protection of the AOA sensors in the external contractorâ€™s paint shop, which resulted in icing blockage of internal movable components of the AOA sensors in the environment with temperatures below zero." Three Safety Recommendations were made: that Czech Airlines Technics and Czech Airlines promptly incorporate in the Repainting Technical Conditions Manual the duty to cover the AOA sensors prior to commencement of pressure water cleansing in compliance with the figure below.. that Czech Airlines adds to the existing test flight documentation for the respective aircraft weight and configuration: the speed when the Stick Shaker is activated with AOA/ON the speed when the Stick Shaker is activated with AOA/OFF the speed when the Stick Pusher is activated. the speed when the Stick Shaker is activated with AOA/ON. the speed when the Stick Shaker is activated with AOA/OFF. the speed when the Stick Pusher is activated. that Czech Airlines adds to the existing test flight documentation the procedure to be applied in the case of failure of the Stall Warning System.. The Final Report was issued on 26 May 2014.
