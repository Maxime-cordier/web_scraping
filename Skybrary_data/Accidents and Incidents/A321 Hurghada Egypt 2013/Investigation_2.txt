performed was confirmed as being in strict compliance with Ural Airlines' duty time regulations.. The First Officer's judgement of the touchdown being adversely affected by glare from the runway lighting - although he did not announce this at the time.. The greater overall flying experience of the First Officer relative to the Captain may have led to the latter perceiving a low probability that the former would mishandle the aircraft and lulled him into an inappropriate relaxed state.. Overall, communication between the Captain and the First Officer throughout the event was not sufficiently effective.. Four Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Relevant Organisation should review training concerning landing technique.. that the Relevant Organisation should issue instructions to the cockpit crew to strictly adhere to the SOP (Standard Operation Procedure) and the normal techniques.. that the Relevant Organisation should ensure adherence to Flight Duty Period limits. that the Relevant Organisation should assure the implementation of Human Factors and CRM techniques especially in the area of maintaining 'Situational Awareness' and communicating and sharing any difficulty with other crew members.. The Final Report was issued on 17 November 2013.
