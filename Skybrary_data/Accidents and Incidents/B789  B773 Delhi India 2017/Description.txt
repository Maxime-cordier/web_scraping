On 7 October 2017, the crew of a Boeing 787-9 (G-ZBKF) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from London Heathrow to Delhi as BAW143 was on approach to runway 29 at destination in night VMC when it became obvious that a landing clearance was not going to be given because a departing Boeing 777-300 (HS-TKC) being operated by Thai Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Delhi to Bangkok as THA316 was still on its takeoff roll from the same runway. The crew-initiated go around of the 787-9 resulted in the two aircraft coming to within 0.2 nm laterally and 200 feet vertically.
