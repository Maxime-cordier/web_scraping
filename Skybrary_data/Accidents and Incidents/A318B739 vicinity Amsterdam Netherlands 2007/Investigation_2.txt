aircraft’s position is within 3NM distance of Runway 18C and until the landing has been completed.” It was also found that neither runway controller had noticed the go around and thus neither had identified the potential conflict which it had created because of the premature take off clearance given to the 737. It was also noted as a matter of considerable concern, that “the course of action of the controllers involved was not unusual” and that the internal investigation by the ANSP had concluded that “for capacity reasons, deviations from prescribed operational procedures occur on a regular basis”. It was also noted that, whilst the acceptance by the runway 24 controller of a request from another inbound aircraft to switch from runway 27 to runway 24 for landing after the departure of the next aircraft to take off from 24 after the incident 737 did not appear to have had a direct bearing on the investigated event, there was no ATS procedure to include such an additional complication to the permitted simultaneous use of runways 18C, 24 and 27 nor had there been any or corresponding risk assessment. The Investigation was unhappy with the response actions of both the ANSP and their regulatory oversight agency and found both to be deficient in failing to properly identify the cause of the event and establish an appropriate response. A number of concerns which are discussed in detail in the Investigation Report included: the extent to which it is appropriate for individual controllers to exercise during the discharge of their professional duties using “independence and personal assessment” as far as procedural compliance is concerned. The Investigation “felt that a (safe) individual and independent discharge of duty by Air Traffic Controllers can (only) be reached within a clearly indicated framework” and that “at the time of the incident, this clarity was lacking and had not been addressed by the time the report of the Investigation was finalised".. the inappropriateness and irrelevance of the ANSP-proposed and accepted AIPs amendment requiring pilots to inform ATC “immediately” when initiating a go around.. The overall Conclusion of the Investigation was that: “the incident would not have occurred if the (appropriate ATS) procedure …..had been complied with” and that “an occurrence became unavoidable from the moment (the A318) initiated a go around.” It was also considered that “in view of the existing gusty crosswind, the altitude at which the (A318) go-around had to be initiated, the actions to be taken to direct the aircraft into a stabilised climb and the subsequent TCAS warning, the timing of the missed approach call to Air Traffic Control is considered appropriate”. In respect of the ANSP (LVNL) the Investigation noted that “maintaining adequate separation is the duty of Air Traffic Control” and concluded that “the rules and instructions for air traffic services are lacking a clear distinction between strict regulations and general guidelines; for that reason they are ambiguous” and that “the stated internal remedial measures, such as emphasising to Air Traffic Controllers
