An Investigation was carried out by the Dutch Safety Board. It was noted that two runways (27 and 18C) were in use for landing traffic and one (24) for departing traffic and that there had been quite a strong westerly wind at low levels with associated mechanical turbulence prevailing. It was established that the go around carried out by the A318 had only commenced just before touch down with minimum height being approximately 15 feet over the runway and had been made because it was judged that the aircraft was to the right of the runway 18C centreline to such an extent that the aircraft was not in a safe position to complete the landing. As the A318 approached the designated missed approach stop altitude of 1500 feet, a TCAS TA generated by the nearby B737 was followed almost immediately by a TCAS RA to descend at 1000 fpm or more. This was actioned promptly and resulted in a descent to 1300 feet before clear of conflict was received after 24 seconds of warning. During this time, the conflicting aircraft was visually acquired ahead. In the 36 seconds which elapsed between the initiation of a go around and the RA, it had not been possible for the A318 crew to advise ATC of their go around because of other priorities in a high workload and so it was notified concurrently with advice of the TCAS RA. The 737 was cleared to take off from runway 24 and climb to FL060. As it passed 1107 feet tracking towards a position just ahead of the A318, a coordinated TCAS RA requiring a climb of at least 1500 fpm occurred but this required no crew intervention as the rate of climb was already in excess of that figure. During the RA, the A318 was acquired visually. It was established that although the aircraft TCAS had not activated until about 11 seconds before the closest proximity occurred, both systems had functioned correctly. Radar recordings showed that after the TCAS RA responses, the 737 crossed in front of the A318 at an altitude of 1248 feet. Six seconds later, the A318 passed the same point at an altitude of 1300 feet. It was noted that “the fact that a collision did not occur was due to the lateral separation of both aircraft at the moment KLM1027 crossed in front of AF3484 at the same altitude”. At that moment the estimated distance between the two aircraft based on radar, FDR and TCAS data was 460 metres +/- 25 metres. It was found that the take off clearance for the 737 had been given contrary to the ATC procedures governing simultaneous use of runways 24 and 18C when the A318 was still on short final at approximately 200 feet with 0.7nm to go and 26 seconds prior to the initiation of the go around. The relevant ANSP documented requirement was found to state that: “commencement of a takeoff roll on 24 is not allowed once a landing
