On 15 December 2019, an Airbus A330-200 (VH-EBC) being operated by Qantas Airways on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Sydney to Perth as QF575 and climbing after takeoff in day VMC received indications of a partial hydraulic systems failure and made an initially uneventful return to land. Once on the ground, a smell of hydraulic fluid and signs of a related haze began to become apparent and shortly after the aircraft had been towed to the terminal for passenger disembarkation because of inoperable steering, both the smell and haze worsened and an emergency evacuation was ordered. This used a combination of the two already attached air bridges and emergency slides at three of the other six doors. During the evacuation, one of the 222 passengers sustained a serious injury and five others sustained minor injuries.
