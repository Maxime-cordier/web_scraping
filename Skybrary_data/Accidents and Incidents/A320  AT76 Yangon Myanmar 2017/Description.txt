On 18 September 2017, an Airbus A320 (HS-TXB) being operated by Thai Smile on a scheduled international passenger flight from Yangon to Bangkok as THD302 was on runway 21 awaiting take-off clearance in day VMC when it was instructed to line up and wait behind an ATR72-600 (XY-AJP) being operated by Mann Yadanarpone Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Sittwe to Yangon as MYP417A which was on final approach. An APP controller had to intervene when the TWR controller did not respond to reminders from the A320 crew that they were already on the runway and the A320 was just airborne and still over the runway when the ATR 72 landed.
