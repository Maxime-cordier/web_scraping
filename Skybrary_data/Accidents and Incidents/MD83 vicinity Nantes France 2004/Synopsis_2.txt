the operator;. the weakness of the operatorâ€™s feedback structure;. discomfort and stress due to meteorological conditions;. the crew's perception of the meteorological conditions, which both led to an erroneous interpretation of the weather radar data and, further, led them to fail to take into account the effects of the wind on the descent profile;. the difficulty in checking and cross-checking from the time the crew deviated from the final approach path;. a deviation within the air traffic control organisation between the established procedures and practice, which led to some non-published approach paths;. lack of synergy between the controller and the crew;. a probable hypo vigilance phenomenon on the part of the controller, who was alone at his work station at the time.. The Report's recommendations, beginning on page 49, also focus on institutional and organisational issues including the airline operator and the air traffic control service provider (see Further Reading).
