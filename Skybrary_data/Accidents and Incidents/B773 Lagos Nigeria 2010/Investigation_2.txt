manipulate the auto-throttle switches on the MCP during a critical phase of the flight. the inadvertent engagement of the autopilot during this operation on the MCP. inadequate monitoring of the status of aircraft systems by the crew. It was also considered that the Captain’s decision to advance the flight deck preparation during the turn round at Lagos following a prior short domestic sector so as to leave him time to take a 40 minute in-seat rest may have contributed to his failure to arm the A/T. Safety Action Soon after the Investigation had begun, Boeing issued an Service Bulletin (SB) advising of the release of a new software version of the AP calculator which would prevent involuntary engagement of the AP on the ground during the takeoff roll. It was noted that the FAA had subsequently issued an AD mandating SB implementation within 90 days of 1 April 2010. It was noted that the Air France procedure for turning thebautothrottle off after each flight were contrary to Boeing guidance and that the internal investigation of the incident by Air France “had recommended that a study be made of their documentation with a view to updating it in order to comply with that of the aircraft manufacturer on the disarming of the auto-throttle”. The Final Report of the Investigation was released on 24 October 2010. No Safety Recommendations were made.
