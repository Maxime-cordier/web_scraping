On 11 Jan 2010, a Boeing 777-300ER being operated by Air France on a scheduled passenger flight from Lagos Nigeria to Paris CDG rejected the night take off on runway 36L at Lagos being carried out in normal night visibility from significantly above the applicable V1 speed when it was perceived that the control column pressure to achieve rotation was abnormal. The aircraft stopped before the end of the runway and after requesting and receiving Rescue and Fire Fighting Services cover in case of brake unit overheating, was taxied to the gate for normal passenger disembarkation. Five main landing gear tyres deflated due to thermal fuse activation approaching or at the gate. None of the 234 occupants were injured and the only aircraft damage was to the wheels and brakes.
