On 25 November 2015, an Airbus A321 (F-GTAZ) being operated by Air France on a scheduled passenger flight from Barcelona to Paris CDG as AFR 1449 was given a taxi clearance by GND which included crossing runway 02 en route to its departure runway in daylight and conditions of normal ground visibility. On seeing a red stop bar at the point where runway 02 was about to be entered, the crew queried this and GND responded with an instruction to hold position. A [B734|Boeing 737-400]] being operated by TNT Airways on a cargo flight from Li√®ge to Barcelona which was on short final to land on the same runway did so shortly afterwards.
