An Investigation was carried out by the Spanish Civil Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC). The A321 crew was under the command of a 43 year-old Captain with 8,642 hours total flying experience which included 3,765 hours on type. The 26 year-old First Officer had 2,226 hours total flying experience which included 2,078 hours on type. The 737 crew was under the command of a 43 year-old Captain with 5,526 hours total flying experience which included 75 hours on type. The 52 year old First Officer had 8,394 hours total flying experience which included 1,735 hours on type. The two Controllers on duty at the time were Spanish native speakers who both had valid Level 5 English language proficiency: a 40 year old TWR controller located in the Main (East) TWR who had 12 years experience all at Barcelona and was qualified as a 'Chief Supervisor'. a 37 year old Central GND controller located in the Main(East) TWR who had 5 years experience, all of it at Barcelona.. It was established that during its taxi out (see the track taken on the diagram below) the A321 had been cleared by GND to route south on taxiway 'D' and whilst doing so was cleared to cross runway 02 at D2. On reaching this point a minute later, the crew observed that the stop bar was lit and could also see that an aircraft was on final to land and so they asked GND to confirm the (explicit) crossing clearance given. In response they received an instruction to 'hold position'. It was found that one minute earlier the 737 had been cleared by TWR to land on runway 02 and had done so soon after the 'hold position' instruction. The A321 was then re-cleared to cross and after it had done so, the crew advised ATC that they would be filing a safety report. It was noted that the crossing clearance error had been made just as the 0700L time for the daily change of runway configuration from night to day approached and that two very similar events had already occurred at the same time of day in both 2012 and in 2014. The Investigation examined prevailing ATC procedures and controller training with particular reference to progress made in response to the two Safety Recommendations made (on 26 June 2013) to the ANSP as a result of the Investigation into the 2012 event. These related to controller training and currency with particular reference to runway configuration changes and at the time of the current event were still recorded as having been accepted but not yet implemented. Taking these preceding Recommendations into account, the current Investigation issued three further "Preliminary" Safety Recommendations on 10 June 2015. They were as follows: that ENAIRE lay out a specific plan to ensure compliance with procedures during the night time to day time runway configuration changes at the Barcelona-El Prat Airport. [16/15]. that ENAIRE evaluate the risks associated with runway configuration changes at the Barcelona-El Prat
