On 21 September 2012, a Boeing 737-300 being operated by Lithuanian operator Air Aurela for Monarch Airlines on a passenger flight from Nice to Birmingham lost directional control and left the paved surface when an attempt was made to turn off wet landing runway 33 expeditiously at the end after missing an earlier exit. The excursion was minor and there were no injuries to the 143 occupants who were subsequently disembarked down external steps brought to the rear right door and transported to the terminal in buses. Damage to the aircraft was minor, being confined to the nose wheel tyres.
