state in respect of taxi speed during turns that “when approaching a turn, speed should be slowed to an appropriate speed for conditions. On a dry surface, use approximately 10 knots for turns greater than those typically required for high speed runway turnoffs.” It was considered that “as the runway and taxiway were wet, a lower speed would have been appropriate” yet it had been commenced from above 20 knots. The Investigation formally concluded that “the aircraft departed the paved surface of the taxiway because it turned to vacate the runway at a speed inappropriate for the conditions”. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 13 June 2013. No Safety Recommendations were made.
