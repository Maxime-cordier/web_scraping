crystal icing". A Contributory Factor was determined as "startle effect due to a sudden unexpected indication of low airspeed, following an encounter with turbulence". Eight Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that United Airlines should review its guidance material to Flight Crew on the optimal use of Airborne Weather Radar during flight in or near areas of actual or forecast convective cloud activity. [IRLD2016-004]. that the FAA should conduct a study to establish whether a safety deficiency exists in pitot probe icing protection for aircraft certified under CFR Part 25 prior to 5 January 2015, and address any deficiencies that may be identified. [IRLD2016-005]. that United Airlines should review its Unreliable Airspeed Training, including theoretical and simulator training, for all phases of flight. [IRLD2016-006]. that the Boeing Aircraft Company should review the effectiveness of the current IAS DISAGREE warning as a means of alerting Flight Crews to an unreliable airspeed condition. [IRLD2016-007]. that the Boeing Aircraft Company should review the status of the Boeing Fleet Team Digest relating to erroneous airspeed with a view to reissuing the guidance material. [IRLD2016-008]. that United Airlines should review their guidance material on aircraft upset recognition and startle factor in its recurrent and CRM training programs in the context of the recently published documents, ‘High Altitude Operations, Supplement #1 to the Airplane Upset Recovery Training Aid’, and FAA AC 120-111, ‘Upset Prevention and Recovery Training’. [IRLD2016-009]. that United Airlines should emphasise to flight crew the importance of using Standard Calls, especially during non-normal flight manoeuvres. [IRLD2016-010]. that United Airlines should review its Operations Manual to ensure that the procedures associated with the preservation of Flight Recorders following an Accident or Incident are in accordance with the provisions of ICAO Annex 6. [IRLD2016-011]. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 10 May 2016.
