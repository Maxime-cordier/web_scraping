On 20 October 2013, a Boeing B757-200 (N41140) being operated by United Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Newark to Dublin experienced turbulence during descent at night in IMC. Inappropriate control inputs by the co-pilot PF in response to false airspeed indications caused passenger and crew injuries and system damage also occurred. ATC were advised that medical and emergency services would be required on arrival. Thirteen of the 131 passengers and four of the six cabin crew sustained minor injuries and significant damage to one of the hydraulic systems was confirmed.
