in areas including lookout training, Service policy on contact lenses, cockpit design of the Tutor and future aircraft, and notification to other airspace users about AEF flights. The AAIB Findings included the following: Neither pilot was in contact with ATC, and was not required to be. Neither aircraft was equipped with an electronic CWS. The primary method of collision avoidance was visual - see and be seen. The physical size of the Tutor, together with its all white colour scheme would have made it difficult to acquire visually in the prevailing conditions. It is likely that each aircraft was physically obscured from the other pilot’s view at various times leading up to the collision, thus opportunities to visually acquire the other aircraft were limited for both pilots. Neither aircraft appeared to take avoiding action. The AAIB Investigation identified the Causal Factor of the accident as being that: Neither pilot saw the other aircraft in time to take effective avoiding action, if at all.. Four Contributory Factors were also identified by the Investigation: The nature of the airspace and topography of the region reduced the available operating area such that the aircraft were required to operate in the same, relatively small block of airspace.. There were no formal procedures in place to deconflict the flights, either before or during flight.. The small size of the Tutor and its lack of conspicuity combined to make visual acquisition difficult in the prevailing conditions.. At various stages leading up to the collision, each aircraft was likely to have been obscured from the view of the pilot of the other aircraft by his aircraft’s canopy structure.. In view of “the wide-ranging recommendations” made by the parallel RAF Service Inquiry, the AAIB considered that no further Safety Recommendations were necessary. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 3 November 2010
