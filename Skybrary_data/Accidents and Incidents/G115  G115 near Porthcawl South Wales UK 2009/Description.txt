On 11 February 2009, two civil registered Grob 115E Tutors being operated for the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) and based at RAF St Athan near Cardiff were conducting Air Experience Flights (AEF) for air cadet passengers in uncontrolled airspace near Porthcawl in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when they collided. Both aircraft were sufficiently damaged that they could no longer be controlled and they impacted the ground in the vicinity of the collision killing both pilots and both passengers and resulting in a fuel fed fire in one of the aircraft.
