the applicable regulations was only permitted under the supervision of an aeromedical examiner. However, it was “not possible to determine whether the self-medicated statin use had contributed to the incapacitation” or indeed whether the concealed use of them might have misled aeromedical examiner assessments given that they are generally recognised as often beneficial under appropriately prescribed use.. The Causes of the Captains incapacitation and subsequent death were recorded as a cardiopulmonary system collapse, caused by a stenosis in the coronary artery. His high cholesterol level caused the coronary artery disease and contributed to the stenosis in the coronary artery. His undeclared use of “over the counter” medication probably contributed to a reduction in his lipid levels.This treatment was not managed by (or known to) the aeromedical examiners involved and it was therefore determined that it was not possible for the aeromedical examiner seen the day before to predict the imminent incapacitation of the Captain. Safety Action taken as a result of the findings of the Investigation were noted as including the following: ▪ The GCAA Medical Section provided an update to aeromedical examiners on the latest international findings on lipid management and amended the guidelines for lipid management to provide examiners with additional information when high lipid levels are encountered. ▪ Etihad Airways arranged for all additional onboard crewmembers, particularly but not only all Loadmasters, to receive the training needed to be able to assist in a situation where a pilot or other crewmember is incapacitated with corresponding changes to the OM made. The Final Report was issued on 25 September 2019. Based on the recorded Safety Action taken, no Safety Recommendations were considered necessary.
