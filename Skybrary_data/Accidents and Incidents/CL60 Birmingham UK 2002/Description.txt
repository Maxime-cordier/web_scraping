On 4 January 2002, a Bombardier Challenger 604 (N90AG) being operated by Epps Air Service on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Birmingham to Bangor ME was observed to roll rapidly to the left as it attempted to take off in day VMC and within a few seconds it had crashed inverted within the airport perimeter and been quickly destroyed by impact forces and a fire which resulted in the deaths of all 5 occupants.
