On 17 June 2003, a crew of a Boeing MD-88, being operated by Onur Air, executed a high speed rejected take-off at a late stage which resulted in overrun of the runway and serious damage to the aircraft. The Take Off Configuration Warning System was sounding throughout the take off roll and was ignored. The joining passengers were allowed free seating.
