did not know why the aircraft did not rotate. In the Take-off mass, centre of gravity and stabilizer setting section, the Report states: The take-off mass as derived from the load and trim sheet was 127,529 pounds. Investigation revealed a most probable take-off mass of approximately 130,000 pounds. There was 2,000 pounds more fuel in the centre tank and 1,700 pounds less fuel in the wing tanks, creating a more forward effect on the TO-CG (centre of gravity during take-off) than assumed on the load and trim sheet. The passenger seating was not consistent with the load and trim sheet. Passengers were seated more forward than assumed. [â€¦] For this flight passengers were free to choose their seat (free seating policy). The causal and contributory factors to the accident are identified as: Probable cause(s) The crew resumed the take off and continued whilst the take off configuration warning, as a result of the still incorrect stabilizer setting, reappeared.. The actual center of gravity during take-off (TO-CG) was far more forward than assumed by the crew. As a consequence the horizontal stabilizer was not set at the required position for take-off.. The far more forward TO-CG - contributed to an abnormal heavy elevator control force at rotation and made the pilot to reject the take-off beyond decision speed. This resulted in a runway overrun.. Contributing factors By design the aircraft configuration warning system does not protect against an incorrect TOCG insert.. The aircraft was not equipped with a weight and balance measuring system.. Deviations of operational factors accumulated into an unfavourable aircraft performance condition during take-off.. Cockpit crew showed significant deficits.". A number of Safety Recommendations are made in the Report of the Investigation on the subject of aircraft operations and airport management as well as several specific recommendations on the safety of non-EU aircraft operators' flights in EU airspace.
