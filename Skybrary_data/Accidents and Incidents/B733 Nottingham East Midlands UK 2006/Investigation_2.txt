shot by from a Police helicopter: The Investigation considered that “For a short period during the approach into EMA, the commander lost situational awareness, following inadvertent disconnection of the autopilots, and allowed the aircraft to descend to an uncontrolled contact with the ground. The analysis of the ground marks to the left of Runway 27 threshold, in conjunction with the damage to the right wing tip, indicated that the aircraft had been close to entering an uncontrollable situation as it slid over the ground, from which it would almost certainly not have recovered. The detached right main landing gear had struck the right inner flaps, the rear fuselage - narrowly missing the horizontal stabiliser - and the aircraft passed very close to the surface movement radar head. It is therefore apparent that a catastrophic accident was narrowly avoided.” It was noted that during the course of the Investigation, an amendment to the UK Manual of Air Traffic Services Part I was published to advise controllers to ensure that any transmission of a Company Message will not compromise safety and will not cause a distraction to pilots at a critical period of flight. The AAIB comment was that “any approach in weather conditions which require an automatic landing should be considered a critical period of flight.”
