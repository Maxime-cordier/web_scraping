The Investigation found that the following were Causal Factors: ATC inappropriately transmitted a company R/T message when the aircraft was at a late stage of a CAT III automatic approach.. The commander inadvertently disconnected the autopilots whilst attempting to respond to the R/T message.. The crew did not make a decision to go-around when it was required under SOPs after the disconnection of both autopilots below 500 ft during a CAT III approach.. The commander lost situational awareness in the latter stages of the approach, following his inadvertent disconnection of the autopilots.. The co-pilot did not call ‘go-around’ until after the aircraft had contacted the ground.. It also found that the following were Contributory Factors: The weather forecast gave no indication that mist and fog might occur.. The commander re-engaged one of the autopilots during a CAT III approach, following the inadvertent disconnection of both autopilots at 400 ft aal.. The training of the co-pilot was ineffective in respect of his understanding that he could call for a go-around during an approach. One Safety Recommendation as made as a result of the Investigation: that the Kingdom of Belgium Civil Aviation Authority require TNT Airlines in Belgium to carry out a review of their standard operating procedures to ensure that it is clear to all pilots when go-around action is required.
