On 15 June 2006 a Boeing 737-300 being operated by Belgian Airline TNT on a public transport scheduled service cargo flight from Liège to London Stansted had diverted to Nottingham East Midlands because of deteriorating weather at the intended destination. A Cat 3A ILS approach in daylight and Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) at East Midlands was interrupted when the aircraft was at about 500 feet aal by ATC passing on a Company Message that the flight was to divert to Liverpool instead. The aircraft commander elected to respond to this message and in doing so inadvertently mis managed the aircraft, still in IMC and lost situational awareness. After an EGPWS ‘Pull Up’ Warning and sight of grass ahead through the fog which prevailed, the aircraft touched down with a high rate of descent on the grass 90 metres to one side of the runway paved surface whilst a go round was being initiated. The RH MLG assembly broke off before the aircraft left the ground again and it was then flown to nearby Birmingham for a successful emergency landing.
