On 21 November 2006, an Air Canada Jazz CRJ200 on a scheduled flight from Vancouver to Prince George was cleared for a non-precision approach at destination. During a missed approach because of worse than forecast weather conditions, the crew were unable to retract the flaps from their 45 degree landing setting. A diversion to the designated alternate was commenced but en route, ATC were requested to provide radar vectors to Fort St. John and an emergency was declared due to an expectation of low fuel on arrival. The aircraft subsequently landed without further problem at Fort St. John with about 500 pounds of fuel remaining, equivalent to less than 10 minutes of flight time.
