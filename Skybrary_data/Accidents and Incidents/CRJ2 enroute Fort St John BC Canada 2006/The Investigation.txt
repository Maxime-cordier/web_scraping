An Investigation was carried out by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board. Their findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors were as follows: The maintenance program for Bombardier (CRJ200)flap system actuators in place at the time of the occurrence did not allow for the detection of problems in the flap actuators at an early enough stage to prevent flap failure.. The flaps failed at the 45-degree position, increasing drag significantly. The subsequent increase in fuel consumption required the crew to declare an emergency and divert to Fort St. John, which was a closer airport, landing with less than 10 minutes of fuel remaining.. A thorough knowledge of the flap system and consistency in the maintenance documentation would have allowed the maintenance personnel to identify and solve the problem sooner.. Repetitive flap failures on (the aircraft involved) were the consequence of faulty actuators caused by contamination such as water.. Their findings as to Risk were as follows: Water ingress into the flap system, combined with cold weather operations, is the leading cause of flap system failure on (CRJ200) aircraft.. The quick reference handbook (QRH) does not take into consideration the impact of flap failures at 45° following a missed approach. Consequently, the flight crews are not fully aware of the impact it would have on the aircraft climb performance for obstacle clearance or the impact on fuel consumption.. There is no cruise performance data available with flaps extended. Therefore, the flight crew could not determine the optimum altitude and speed to attain the best fuel economy.. One other Finding of the Investigation was given. This was “that the practice of recycling a circuit breaker to rectify a problem has inherent risks; however, in this occurrence, it was a reasonable action on the part of the crew.”
