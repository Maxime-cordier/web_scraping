safety area.. The Airport Emergency Plan (AEP) was inadequate to cover an accident emergency occurring outside the airport perimeter.. It took more than 2 hours to extinguish the fire. The delay in extinguishing the fire, and the lack of appropriate fire suppressant agents, may have significantly reduced survivability.. The Conclusion of the Investigation as to Causes taken from the Report of the Investigation as published were as follows: Flight crew communication and coordination was less than effective after the aircraft passed 2,336 feet on descent after flap 1 was selected. Therefore the safety of the flight was compromised.. The PIC flew the aircraft at an excessively high airspeed and steep descent during the approach. The crew did not abort the approach when stabilised approach criteria were not met.. The pilot in command did not act on the 15 GPWS alerts and warnings, and the two calls from the co pilot to go around.. The co pilot did not follow company instructions and take control of the aircraft from the pilot in command when he saw that the pilot in command repeatedly ignored warnings to go around.. Garuda did not provide simulator training for its Boeing 737 flight crews covering vital actions and required responses to GPWS and EGPWS alerts and warnings such as ‘TOO LOW TERRAIN’ and ‘WHOOP, WHOOP PULL UP’..
