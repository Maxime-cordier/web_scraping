On 29 March 2018, a Boeing 787-9 (4X-EDB) being operated by El Al on a scheduled international passenger flight from Tel Aviv to Newark as LY 027 which was a line check for one of the First Officers on board completed what was believed by the augmented crew to have been a normal night VMC takeoff from the 4042 metre-long runway 26. However, when reviewing cruise performance, the cruise altitude in the FMC was about 4000 feet higher than expected and it was discovered that the Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) entered prior to departure had been much lower than the actual ZFW. The data input error was corrected and the flight was completed without further event, although the occurrence was immediately communicated to the Operator. There was no damage to the aircraft and its 300 occupants were unaffected.
