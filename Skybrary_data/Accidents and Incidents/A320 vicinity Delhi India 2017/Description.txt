On 21 June 2017, the number 2 CFM56-5B engine of an Airbus A320 (VT-GOS) being operated by GoAir on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Delhi to Mumbai as G8-338 began to malfunction during the takeoff roll. The takeoff was continued but once airborne in day VMC, the serviceable number 1 engine was shut down and TO/GA thrust set on the malfunctioning number 2 engine. An emergency was declared and an immediate return requested and approved. Whilst the critical error was being identified and addressed, the airspeed dropped sufficiently for ALPHA floor protection against excessive angle of attack to be activated. A recovery to controlled flight with the malfunctioning number 2 engine set to idle was eventually achieved and on the second attempt a visual approach and landing back at Delhi was accomplished. Once parked, fan blade damage to the right engine which was subsequently attributed to a bird strike could be seen.
