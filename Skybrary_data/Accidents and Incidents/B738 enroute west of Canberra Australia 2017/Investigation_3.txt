response to any overspeed risk was not a documented Qantas or Boeing procedure, the potential effect on this practice was not considered when the AP modification being implemented at the time of the investigated event was developed. The Findings of the Investigation were formally documented as follows: The increase in headwind while VH-VZZ was making a routine high speed descent at 320 knots resulted in the airspeed increasing towards the aircraft’s maximum allowable speed.. The pilot flying applied a control column input to prevent an overspeed, which resulted in the autopilot unexpectedly disengaging. The consequent change of pitch and g-loading led to two cabin crew suffering injuries.. The aircraft’s autopilot had been modified such that, if sufficient control column back pressure was applied, the autopilot would disengage rather than revert to the Control Wheel Steering (CWS) mode. Autopilot disengagement resulted in larger elevator and pitch responses than those associated with reversion to CWS mode.. The Board concluded that the Investigation had provided the opportunity to define a Safety Message which was as follows: “Although there was no expectation of varying wind conditions during the descent on this occasion, this occurrence highlights the increased risk of overspeed when operating with a reduced margin below Vmo. The intervention by the pilot flying to prevent the impending overspeed was understandable, and consistent with previous responses of other flight crew in similar situations. However, as detailed in the Qantas Safety Information Notice, when faced with an impending overspeed, abrupt pitch changes may have more adverse consequences than an overspeed event. The manufacturer’s preferred use of speedbrakes to manage increasing airspeed, removes the hazard associated with abrupt pitch changes.” The Final Report was released on 14 March 2018. No Safety Recommendations were issued.
