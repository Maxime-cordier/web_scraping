On 3 November 2019, a Boeing 787-8 (N796AV) being operated by Avianca on an international scheduled passenger flight from Bogota to Barcelona as AVA018 with an augmented flight crew was in the descent to destination when the airspeed began to increase towards Vmo as the Captain was making a flight progress announcement to the passengers. He responded primarily by disconnecting the AP and abruptly pulling back on and then releasing the control column which led to an abrupt change in vertical acceleration and two serious injuries in the cabin, one to a member of the cabin crew. The remaining 259 persons on board were unaffected by the upset.
