any Doctors on board to assist with the injury responses yielded two volunteers. FDR data highlighting the context of the momentary upset made to avoid a Vmo exceedance. [Reproduced from the Official Report] A copy of the flight data was passed to Boeing but they advised that they were unable to replicate the change from VNAV SPD mode to VNAV PATH mode which had accompanied the unexpected rise in airspeed towards VMO and in the absence of any evidence of significant windshear being present, the origin of the speed increase which led to the inappropriate aircraft handling response could not be determined. The Probable Cause of the accident was formally documented as "the set of actions taken by the pilot at the controls (PF) to prevent the aircraft from exceeding the maximum permissible operating speed (VMO), which resulted in an abrupt change in vertical acceleration that seriously injured a passenger and a member of the cabin crew”. The following two Contributory Factors were considered to have been present: The pilot at the controls’ (PF) decision to make a passenger announcement without delegating his functions to the pilot monitoring (PM). a lack of monitoring from the PM. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that AVIANCA establish guidelines for distributing tasks among the members of the flight crew when passenger announcements are being made from the flight deck. [REC 32/21]. The Final Report of the Investigation was approved on 30 June 2021 and subsequently published simultaneously in the definitive Spanish language and in an English language translation on 19 October 2021.
