On 4 July 2019, an Alauda Airspeeder Mark II UAV being operated by the same company which had designed and manufactured it was making a demonstration flight at Goodwood aerodrome under a specific regulatory approval when the pilot lost control of it. The UAV climbed to 8000 feet into controlled airspace at a designated holding pattern for London Gatwick before its electrical power was exhausted and it descended at 5000 fpm and impacted the ground close to occupied houses half a mile from the takeoff point.
