On 29 July 2012, a Pilatus PC6 (EC-IBY) being operated by Skydive Lillo on parachute drop detail out of Ã‰vora in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) had just initiated descent from around 13000 feet with only the pilot on board after completing the drop when there was a sudden loud noise/vibration from the tail section of the aircraft and the pilot found that he had lost both rudder and stabiliser authority. Pitch control was regained using the electric stabiliser trim and a successful touchdown was achieved on the second attempt. However, directional control could not be maintained as the tailwheel aircraft decelerated and the aircraft departed the side of the runway. The rudder was found to have partly detached and fallen onto the horizontal stabiliser. No additional damage to the aircraft resulted from the runway excursion during landing.
