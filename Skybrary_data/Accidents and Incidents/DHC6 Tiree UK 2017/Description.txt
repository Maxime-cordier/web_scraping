On 7 March 2017, a DHC6-300 (G-BVVK) being operated by Loganair on a scheduled passenger flight from Glasgow to Tiree left the side of the runway soon after touching down at destination after a final approach conducted in day VMC. It travelled a short distance over grass before entering and coming to a stop on the intersecting runway near its intersection with the landing runway. The aircraft was undamaged and the occupants were uninjured and it was subsequently taxied to the Terminal.
