On 13 October 2009, an Avro RJ100 being operated by Malmö Aviation on a scheduled passenger flight from Stockholm Bromma to Malmö in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) came into proximity with a unseen light aircraft crossing below which activated a TCAS RA which was followed. The flight crew were unaware that they were outside controlled airspace at the time. No abrupt manoeuvring occurred and none of the 85 occupants were injured.
