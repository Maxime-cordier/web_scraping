On 24 July 2011, a Boeing 777-300 being operated by Thai Airways International on a scheduled passenger flight from Bangkok to Melbourne descended so far below the vertical profile for the night non precision approach procedure being flown in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) at destination that ATC, observing that the aircraft was below the minimum safe altitude for the range from touchdown, instructed the aircraft to fly a go around. However, despite acknowledgement, this instruction only resulted in the descent being arrested and the go around did not commence until a further instruction to do so was given nearly a minute later. The subsequent approach using the same procedure was uneventful.
