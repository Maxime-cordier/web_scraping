to runway 16 at Melbourne - and the Operator had advised that they had “known about the difficulties in flying approaches without constant angle approach paths” and were intending to provide their Boeing 777 pilots with appropriate training. The formal statement of Findings from this Investigation was as follows: Contributing safety factors The pilot in command probably experienced an ‘automation surprise’ when the aircraft’s vertical navigation (VNAV) flight management system automatically changed from VNAV speed mode to VNAV path mode.. The flight crew did not manage the aircraft’s descent in accordance with the prescribed instrument approach procedure, resulting in descent below the applicable approach segment minimum safe altitude.. Other safety factors The flight crew’s selection of flight level change mode during the approach increased the risk of inadvertent descent below the required vertical flight path.. Other key findings Following the tower controller’s initial instruction to go around, there was a delay of about 50 seconds before the flight crew selected take-off/go-around thrust and commenced a climb to the required altitude.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 19 February 2013.
