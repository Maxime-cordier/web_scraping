An Investigation was carried out by the Myanmar Accident/Incident Investigation Bureau (MAIB). Examination of data from the FDR and CVR of the two aircraft involved and the prevailing weather conditions were both recorded by the Investigation as "not applicable". The 40 year-old A319 Captain had accumulated 15,752 total flying hours which included 10,688 hours on type and their 29 year-old First Officer had accumulated 6,174 total flying hours which included 2,091 hours on type. The total flying hours of the 48 year-old A330 Captain were not recorded but they included 5,448 hours whilst employed at Sichuan Airlines on the A320 made up of 1181 hours on the A320 and 4,267 hours on the A330. There were two First Officers on the A330 flight deck, the 28 year-old had accumulated 1,797 total flying hours made up of 807 hours on the A320 and 740 hours on the A330 and the 34 year-old had accumulated 2640 total flying hours made up of 1,229 hours on the A320 and 1,161 hours on the A330. The 34 year-old Controller and their 45 year-old Shift Manager were both working a 12 hour day shift which had 3¾ hours to run at the time of the investigated event and had 11 and 21 years work experience respectively. It was established that the A330 had been transferred to Yangon ACC by Kunming ACC 8nm prior to the Chinese/Myanmar border at waypoint LINSO. When overhead this waypoint, the crew called Yangon ACC and advised that they were maintaining FL 360. A few seconds later, without acknowledging this initial call, the controller transmitted to another aircraft identified as "MJC" that they were identified and should report LSO and descend to FL350 as FL370 was not available due traffic. The A330 crew then responded to the call made to "MJC" without including their callsign but confirming the next reporting point and seeking confirmation of the descent instruction to which the controller replied "affirm descend FL 350" also without including the callsign and the A330 crew responded with "603, next report LSO and right now descend to FL 350". This was followed immediately by the Controller with "MJC, affirmative descend FL 350" to which the A330 crew responded to with "Descend to FL 350, next report position LSO thank you CSC 603". The A330 began descent from FL 360 to FL 350, the level which the A319 was maintaining in accordance with its clearance. At this time, the radar display being used by the controller did not show the A330. About a minute later, a Predicated Conflict Alert (PCA) was annunciated on the Kunming ACC radar display showing that the A330 was descending to the level already occupied by the eastbound A319. The Kunming Controller "tried to coordinate with Yangon ACC" and meanwhile called (the A319) and told its crew to make an immediate right turning onto a heading of 125° to avoid the opposite A330 which resolved the conflict. As the two aircraft passed, the ADS-B data from the A330
