The Government of India should recognise the importance of the ATC profession and accord special status to it, preferably by examining the feasibility of de-linking ATS from the wider organisational set-up and creating an independent ATC profession to be governed by separate provisions.. The Airports Authority of India should introduce sectorisation to approach control and re-organise working space in the Delhi airport ATC (new complex) so as to match functional requirements of Area/Approach Control, the ATC Simulator and the Indian Air Force element.
