On 13 December 2011, an Airbus A320-200 being operated by Aeroflot on a scheduled passenger flight from Frankfurt to Moscow Sheremetyevo was cleared for a daylight take off in normal visibility from a runway parallel to one where an Airbus A380-800 being operated by Lufthansa on a scheduled passenger flight from Tokyo to Frankfurt was about to touch down but this aircraft then commenced an own initiative go around. The A320 take off clearance was not cancelled and due to subsequent proximity of the respective aircraft flight paths, the standard wake vortex separation minima were breached and the A320 was exposed to the risk of encountering wake vortex turbulence. However, no such encounter actually occurred.
