FCTM was found to state that an excessive rotation rate should be avoided in order to prevent a tailstrike whilst noting that a temporary main landing gear contact with the runway “is acceptable”. It was also noted that during manual landings with the aircraft less than 50 feet agl, an aural alert is triggered if the pitch attitude is expected to exceed 9° nose-up using a predictive calculation of the pitch attitude one second ahead. It was also noted that below 400 feet agl with a landing imminent, a fixed tailstrike pitch limit of 8.6° is displayed on the PFD based on “the pitch limit on the ground with the main landing gear compressed plus an additional margin”. The maximum nose up pitch input made by the First Officer at the same time as selecting TOGA thrust with the aircraft so close to the runway failed to take account of the fact that engine spool up time was such that effective thrust to arrest descent with the airspeed dropping was not going to be available in time to prevent a main landing gear runway contact with the achieved pitch attitude in excess of 9°. Indeed, it had already reached a recorded 11° as the tailstrike began and had continued increasing and was passing 13° when the tailstrike ceased as the main landing gear became fully airborne. The formally-stated Conclusion of the Investigation was as follows: A go around was initiated from low height and low speed. The aircraft had insufficient energy to climb immediately and so touched down during the go-around process. The pitch rate induced by the co-pilot caused the aircraft to reach a nose up attitude sufficient to cause a tailstrike as the aircraft touched down. The Final Report was published on 18 August 2022. No Safety Recommendations were made.
