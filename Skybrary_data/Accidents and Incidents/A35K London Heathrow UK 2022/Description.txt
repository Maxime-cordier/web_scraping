On 2 January 2022, an Airbus A350-1000 (G-XWBC) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Dubai to London Heathrow sustained a tailstrike as it commenced a go around from the landing flare at destination in day VMC and unexceptional surface wind conditions. A second approach to a normal landing was subsequently completed but significant damage was subsequently found to the underside of the rear fuselage.
