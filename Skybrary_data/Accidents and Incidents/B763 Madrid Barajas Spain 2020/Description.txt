On 3 November 2020, a Boeing 767-300 (C-GHOZ) being operated by Air Canada on a scheduled international passenger flight from Madrid Barajas to Toronto as ACA837was just about to rotate when one of the left main gear tyres failed and debris was ingested into the left engine resulting in its failure. The takeoff was completed in day VMC whilst the failed engine was shut down and a MAYDAY declared. After just over four hours airborne to the southeast of the airport at up to 8000 feet in order to burn off excess fuel, the aircraft landed back at Barajas but awaiting sufficient brake temperature reduction to proceed to a gate then delayed passenger disembarkation by over an hour. None of the 138 occupants were injured.
