On August 8, 2009 a privately operated PIPER PA32-260 Cherokee Six and a Eurocopter AS350BA helicopter being operated by Liberty Helicopters on a public transport sightseeing flight collided in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) over the Hudson River near Hoboken, New Jersey whilst both operating under Visual Flight Rules (VFR). The three occupants of the PA32, which was en route from Wings Field PA to Ocean City NJ, and the six occupants of the helicopter, which had just left the West 30th Street Heliport, were killed and both aircraft were destroyed.
