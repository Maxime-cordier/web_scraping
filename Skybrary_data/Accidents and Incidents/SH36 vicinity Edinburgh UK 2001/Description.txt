On 27 February 2001, a Shorts SD3-60 (G-BNMT) being operated by Loganair on a scheduled domestic cargo flight from Edinburgh to Belfast Aldergrove with just the flight crew on board suffered a simultaneous and complete loss of power on both engines in day VMC shortly after take-off from Edinburgh. A MAYDAY was declared and a ditching into a rough sea state was attempted near the shoreline of the Firth of Forth but was not successful and the aircraft became submerged and neither pilot survived.
