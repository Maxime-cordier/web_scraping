An Investigation was carried out by the Swiss AIB (SAIB). Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) recording from the aircraft involved had been overwritten and so were not available to support the Investigation which relied primarily on ATCC radar and R/T recordings. It was established that both aircraft had checked in with the same Zurich ACC frequency at about the same time and were on crossing tracks, the A320 (TAP 706) at FL370 and heading north east and the 737 (RYR 3595) at FL360 and heading north. Approximately ten minutes later, another Ryanair 737 using the callsign RYR 6DW checked in on the frequency level at FL320 and was cleared to FL340. Shortly after this, the first 737 (RYR 3595) asked the controller if there were any reports of turbulence on their route and received the response negative. This was followed by a broken call from RYR 4492 which advised that there was light turbulence over the Alps which RYR 3595 immediately followed up with a request not preceded by their callsign to climb to FL380 due to turbulence. The controller replied to this request with the instruction to RYR 6DW to climb to FL380. The crew of flight RYR 3595 then responded with their own callsign to the clearance for flight RYR 6DW and began a climb. Neither the controller nor RYR 6DW responded to the incorrrect readback of RYR 3595. The A319, TAP 706, was then transferred to Rhine Radar at FL370 and soon afterwards, an Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) activation occurred identifying an impending conflict between RYR 3595 and TAP 706. The controller immediately called RYR 3595 to confirm that they were maintaining FL360 and upon receiving a 'negative' response instructed them to descend immediately due to traffic above which was acknowledged with 'descending' but without any mention of a TCAS RA. In fact both aircraft received and actioned coordinated TCAS RAs, TAP 706 to Climb and RYR 3595 to descend which were actioned. TAP 706 reported theirs to Rhine Radar at the time and RYR 3595 did so to Zurich subsequently. It was noted that "both crews reacted to the visual and aural resolution advisories (RAs) of their TCAS without delay and in accordance with the procedures prescribed by their operator". The CPA - 650 feet vertically and 0.8nm laterally - occurred 12 seconds after the STCA activation. A radar plot of the conflict is shown below: The crew of RYR 3595 were recorded as a French Commander with considerable experience on type accompanied by a Spanish First Officer with less than 1000 flying hours, the majority of these on the aircraft type. The Investigation concluded in respect of both pilots that "all the available evidence suggests that both started their duty well-rested and in good health". ANSP Skyguide conducted an Air Traffic Capacity Management analysis which concluded that the decision to combine the vertically adjacent sectors in which the conflict occurred "was correct and in accordance with procedures" although it was
