On 12 April 2013, an Airbus A319 (CS-TTD) being operated by TAP Air Portugal on a scheduled passenger flight (TAP 706) from Lisbon to Prague and a Boeing 737-800 (EI-ENK) being operated by Ryanair on a scheduled passenger flight (RYR 3595) from Pisa to LÃ¼beck were both in the cruise in Swiss airspace in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when they received coordinated TCAS RAs. These were flown and the potential conflict generated by the 737 taking a clearance directed at another Ryanair aircraft was resolved with a CPA of 0.8nm laterally and 650 feet vertically.
