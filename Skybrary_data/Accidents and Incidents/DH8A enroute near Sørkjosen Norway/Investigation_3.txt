in the permitted ‘Flight’ range. If this action is take in flight, a loud warning sound will occur. The Investigation noted the existence of an optional modification, which had not been taken up by Widereøe at the time of the event, which prevents movement below Flight Idle unless the radio altitude is 20 feet or less or the aircraft air/ground sensing system is in ‘ground’. The Investigation came to the conclusion that: the incident occurred due to too weak safety barriers in the protection systems on the Power Levers.. the left engine was not seriously damaged, probably because it did not reach the same degree of propeller overspeed as the right engine.. the left engine by mere chance avoided similar damages and (so) the incident (must be regarded as serious because) the aircraft could have lost engine power on both engines.. the left engine was not seriously damaged probably because it did not reach the same degree of propeller overspeed as the right engine.. The AIBN also noted that during their investigation of a Widereøe DHC8-100 accident at Hammerfest on 1 May 2005, the crew had reported hearing “something they likened to birds twittering” without knowing what it meant, which had in retrospect been identified as the warning sound signifying the release of the mechanical stop which removes the Flight Idle gate. Although it had been concluded that this issue had not had any direct bearing on the accident outcome, one of the seven Safety Recommendations made in the 2009 Norwegian language Final Rep ort had been to the effect that "Widerøe should consider whether the pilots’ knowledge and awareness of this system can be improved.”. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation: that Transport Canada and EASA require the type certificate holder (Bombardier) to introduce measures to prevent propeller overspeed during unintended management of Power Levers.. The Final Report of the Investigation was released on 22 June 2012.
