On 21 February 2006, a Bombardier DHC8-100 being operated by Wideroe Flyveselskap on a passenger flight from Tromsø to Sørkjosen experienced a temporary loss of control during descent in night IMC when the power levers were inadvertently selected to a position aft of the Flight Idle gate and propeller overspeed and engine malfunction followed. After recovery and shut down of the right engine, a return to Tromsø was made using the remaining engine without further event. All 20 occupants were secured by seat belts at the time and uninjured.
