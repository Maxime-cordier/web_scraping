On 29 December 2010 a Boeing 757-200 being operated by American AL on a scheduled passenger flight from Chicago Oâ€™Hare to Jackson Hole failed to stop before the end of landing runway 19 at destination after a daylight landing in normal ground visibility with light snow falling and finally stopped in deep snow 220 metres beyond it. The aircraft incurred only minor damage and with none of the 185 occupants injured, the aircraft commander decided that the best option was for everyone to remain on the aircraft and await ground assistance. Passengers were eventually disembarked using steps and bussed to the Terminal.
