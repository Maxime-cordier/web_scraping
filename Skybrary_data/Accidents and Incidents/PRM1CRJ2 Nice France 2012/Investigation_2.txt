the sign indicating taxiway W could not be seen clearly from the taxiway junction. the complexity of the area between runways 04L and 04R, which is an intersection of several taxiways and is very wide. the transition from the edge lighting to the reflective lighting. It was also concluded that the inability of ATC to detect the conflict and the low height of the Raytheon 390 cockpit also contributed to the incident. Safety Action take by the Nice Airport Operator following the incident was noted as follows: The Holding Point ‘A3’ has been designated as a Hot Spot - the first such designation in respect of runway 04R. The centreline lighting along taxiway ‘A3’ has been concealed and the use of this connecting taxiway has been prohibited at night.. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the DGAC should install equipment allowing ATC to detect and be alerted to the risk of a collision on the ground and in particular of a runway incursion at aerodromes with heavy traffic .. that the DSNA (the French State ANSP) should ensure that, at all aerodromes, the aerodrome charts precisely reflect the reality of the infrastructure.. The Final Report of the Investigation was issued in a French language version only in May 2011 and is also available here on SKYbrary in an unofficial English language translation.
