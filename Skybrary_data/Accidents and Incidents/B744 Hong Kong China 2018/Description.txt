On 30 August 2018, a Boeing 747-400F (N415MC) being operated by Atlas Air on an international positioning flight from Dubai Al Maktoum International to Hong Kong as GTI 8086 during which a revalidation line check was being conducted veered abruptly away from the runway centre line shortly after touching down in a crosswind following a day VMC approach and both right side engines were damaged by runway contact before normal control was regained and the taxi in completed. Damage to the inlet cowl, fan cowl, reverser translating cowl drain of both right hand engines was subsequently found such that all these parts needed to be replaced.
