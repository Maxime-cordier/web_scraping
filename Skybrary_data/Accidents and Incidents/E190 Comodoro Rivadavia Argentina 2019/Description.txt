On 8 August 2019, the crew of an Embraer 190 (LV-CPJ) being operated by Austral on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Comodoro Rivadavia to Mendoza in normal day visibility observed a vehicle crossing the runway ahead as they accelerated during takeoff but decided that takeoff could be safely completed based on their distance from the vehicle and its observed crossing speed. This proved to be a correct judgement and there was no actual risk of collision with the flight subsequently taking off normally.
