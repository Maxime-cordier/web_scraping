On 29 February 2020, an Airbus A320 (VT-CCU) being operated by Air Asia (India) on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Goa to Delhi as IAD778 and an Airbus A320 (VT-IAR) being operated by Indigo on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Delhi to Chennai as IGO2124 came into close proximity in night IMC when on reciprocal tracks at less than the prescribed vertical separation whilst working the same radar control frequency. TCAS RA activation and compliance eliminated the collision risk and the minimum achieved separation was 0.5nm laterally and 600 feet vertically.
