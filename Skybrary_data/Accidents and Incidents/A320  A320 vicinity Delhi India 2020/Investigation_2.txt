was sufficiently busy with multiple requests for track variations due to adverse weather conditions to miss seeing the STCA initial alert activation and only attempted conflict resolution when the subsequent audible warning was activated by which time TCAS was about to resolve the problem and when it did so the RAs were correctly followed. Once the aircraft had passed, it seemed that the Air Asia crew had still not recognised their error so they challenged the controller about his assertion which the recorded communications confirmed had been read back as given but then set incorrectly. The Probable Cause of the event was determined as “the unauthorised descent made by the Air Asia A320 below FL110 in violation of its ATC clearance”. Two Contributory Factors were also identified as follows: the increase in workload on the flight deck of the Air Asia A320 due to bad weather.. the inadequate monitoring of traffic in close proximity.. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Air Asia should provide corrective training to the pilots of their A320 as per the syllabus giving major emphasis to situational awareness.. that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) should advise its controllers to be more vigilant in respect of system generated alerts.. The Final Report was completed on 1 July 2020 and subsequently published. Loss of Separation. Loss of Separation During Weather Avoidance. Level Bust. Read-back or Hear-back. Cross-checking Process. Vigilance in ATM. Controller Workload. ACAS Resolution and Traffic Advisories. Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA).
