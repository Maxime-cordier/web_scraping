A Serious Incident Investigation was carried out by the Indian Aircraft Accidents Investigation Bureau (AAIB) by reference primarily to downloaded data from the Air Asia A320 CVR and FDR and recorded ATC radar data and communications with both aircraft. It was noted that the Air Asia A320 flight crew consisted of a 35 year-old Captain who had a total of 5,426 hours flying experience which included 326 hours on type and a 32 year old First Officer who had a total of 2,283 hours flying experience, all but 271 hours of which were on type. The 50 year old Indigo A320 Captain had a total of 7,086 hours flying experience which included 3,427 hours on type and the 28 year old First Officer had a total of 1,791 hours flying experience, all but 201 hours of which were on type. It was established that shortly after the inbound Air Asia A320, on a generally south-westerly track, had been cleared to descend to FL120, the outbound Indigo A320, on a generally north-westerly track, had been cleared to climb to FL90. Both aircraft then requested right turns for weather avoidance and Air Asia was given a heading of 015° and Indigo direct to waypoint ‘AKRIB’. Air Asia was then cleared to descend to FL110 and Indigo were then given climb to FL100 to expedite and both aircraft correctly read back their clearances. After their turns for weather avoidance, the two aircraft were now on almost reciprocal tracks (see the radar snapshot below). Having seen that Air Asia had actually descended to FL100 after receiving an audible STCA Warning, the controller immediately tried to resolve it by instructing it to climb (back) to FL110, following this with an instruction to Indigo to descend to FL095 and immediately changed this to FL090 before a response to the original descent instruction had been given. But by this time a coordinated TCAS RA had occurred and immediately after the controller had finished transmitting, Air Asia called “TCAS RA” and the controller responded with “call clear of conflict”. After a short interval, Indigo called “clear of conflict” and advised climbing back to FL100 as previously cleared which was acknowledged. The controller, having not heard the same from Air Asia requested this and received confirmation before telling the flight it had only been cleared to FL110. The response was initially to dispute this and request details of the conflicting traffic which were given. Indigo then requested and was given further climb to FL110. The conflict at the STCA Alert stage showing the two aircraft on almost reciprocal tracks. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The Air Asia A320 PM read back their descent clearance to FL110 correctly but then set FL100 in the selected altitude window and the AP therefore took the aircraft into a level bust which given the near reciprocal track of the Indigo A320 which had climbed as cleared to FL100 resulted in a coordinated TCAS RA annunciation which both aircraft then followed.
