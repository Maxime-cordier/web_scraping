On 1 December 2013, a Piaggio 180 (C-GFOX) taxiing for departure at Ottawa from the Police Apron there at night in normal ground visibility crossed an active runway ahead of a Bombardier DHC8-300 (C-GEWQ) being operated by Jazz Aviation which was taking off on a scheduled passenger flight from Ottawa to Montr√©al as JZA 988. Neither of the aircraft flight crews were aware of the runway incursion, and both aircraft continued their respective departures without further event.
