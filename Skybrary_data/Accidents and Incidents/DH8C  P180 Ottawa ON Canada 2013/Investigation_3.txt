(Tower) controller.. The (Tower) controller cleared JZA988 for take-off on Runway 14, and C-GFOX subsequently entered Runway 14 as JZA988 was departing, leading to the runway incursion and risk of collision.. The formally stated Findings as to Risk were as follows: If there is insufficient staff available to deal with staffing shortfalls, there is an increased risk of error due to workload and fatigue.. If the air navigation service provider does not provide clear direction as to when flight data entries have to be forwarded within the Extended Computer Display System, there is a risk that control instructions will be issued without a complete understanding of the operational environment.. Safety Action taken by ANSP NAV CANADA as a result of the occurrence was noted to have included a review of its procedures for operating when short-staffed and the issue of a "Tower Operations Directive" at Ottawa which was subject to a mandatory verbal briefing. This introduced more effective use of the EXCDS when runway crossings are included in clearances. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 10 June 2015 and it was officially released on 16 July 2015. No Safety Recommendations were made.
