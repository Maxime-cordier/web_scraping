On 20 October 2014, a Dassault Falcon 50EX (F-GLSA) being operated by Unijet on an international passenger charter flight from Moscow to Paris Le Bourget as LEA074P and taking off from runway 06 collided with a snow plough at the intersection of the take-off runway with runway 01/19 and was destroyed as a consequence of the effects of the impact and a post crash fire. The four occupants of the aircraft were killed but the snow plough driver was unhurt. There was fog present at the time of the collision, but the IRVR was sufficient not to be a limiting factor in the visual acquisition by pilots of any runway obstructions ahead.
