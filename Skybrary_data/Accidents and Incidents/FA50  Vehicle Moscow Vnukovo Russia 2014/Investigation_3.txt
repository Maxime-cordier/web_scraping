to establish whether it would have been possible for the crew to reject the take-off had they begun such action immediately after the Captain had spoken on the intercom of seeing a (moving) "car". It was concluded after careful analysis with the assistance of the aircraft manufacturer that, assuming that the runway had been covered with 1 mm of wet snow, if the crew had promptly rejected the take-off at the moment they first noticed the "car", "most probably, they might have been able to stop the aircraft before the snowplough" or in the worst case with low forward speed, steer around it. FDR data showed that the aircraft became airborne after a take-off roll of 845 metres and performance data suggested that the further distance required to reach 35 feet agl using normal take-off techniques would have been around 200 metres whereas recorded radar data showed that by this point, the now-stationary snowplough was only 145 metres - and two seconds - away. It was noted that although the weather recorded at the time of the take-off roll included "fog", the actual IRVR along runway 06 at the time was a steady 1,000 metres which was almost the same as the distance from that point to the collision - 980 metres, so it was concluded that lack of forward visibility alone had not been a causal factor in the collision. It was subsequently found that the (unexplained) performance of the snowplough driver involved may have been affected by his consumption of alcohol whilst on duty. Much of the remainder of the Investigation involved a very detailed examination of all aspects of the airside operational environment at Vnukovo and much evidence of a very significant number of related and apparently habitual procedural non compliances with existent procedures and an obvious absence of sufficient or adequate working practices and personnel training. Many of the findings in these areas which were not identified as directly causal to the collision were formally recorded as an inventory of 24 "Shortcomings" (see below) and the 55 Safety Recommendations made (see below) sought to address both these Shortcomings and the 16 formally documented Contributory Factors which it was considered had in combination caused the accident to occur. These were as follows: a lack of guidance in pertinent documents defining the duties of aerodrome service personnel (aerodrome shift supervisor and vehicle drivers) on any loss of control over an aerodrome vehicle and/or situational awareness on the aerodrome;. the insufficient effectiveness of risk mitigation measures to prevent runway incursions attributable to the presence of two intersecting runways;. a lack of proper supervision by the aerodrome shift supervisor over airside operations with no report to ATC or request to the snowplough driver as he lost visual contact with it, with his performance potentially affected by alcohol consumption;. violation by the aerodrome shift supervisor of the procedure for aerodrome vehicle operations in particular their entering of runway 01/19 when it was closed for take-off and landing operations without requesting and
