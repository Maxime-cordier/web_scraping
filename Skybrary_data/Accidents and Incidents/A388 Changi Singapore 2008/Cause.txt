The Air Accident Investigation Bureau of Singapore included the following findings in the report: "Owing to the orientation of Bay A4 with respect to Twy WA and the space restriction, pushing an A380 from the bay to face south on Twy WA required skill and good judgment in maneuvering the aircraft along the yellow lead-in line.. The lighting of Bay A4 area was adequate to enable the yellow lead-in lines to be seen from the bay up to where the two curved yellow lead-in lines intersect.. The taxiway centreline at Bay A4 area was not reflective and was difficult to see.. The air tug driver failed to exercise proper judgment in adhering to the lead-in line when pushing back an A380 aircraft from Bay A4.. The air tug driver did not stop the pushback to assess the situation when he had deviated from the lead-in line and could not see the taxiway centreline.. The air tug driver’s company had assigned a driver who was pushing out an A380 aircraft for the first time.. The head set man was not assertive enough to stop the air tug driver when he noticed the aircraft had deviated from the lead-in line.". The following facts were categorized as ‘other issues’: "The shear bolts on the tow bars were at much lower torque values than that stipulated.. The shear bolt distance on the tow bar was wider than that specified by the aircraft manufacturer. This could have affected the shearing characteristics of the shear bolts.. The torque wrenches were calibrated in imperial units and there were no conversion tables for their conversion to metric units for use by the equipment maintenance personnel.. The equipment maintenance personnel apparently lacked knowledge of proper maintenance of tow bars.. The elbow connector on the air tug was removed without prior permission of the AAIB investigators. The towing pin in the tow bar clamp had been disturbed.".
