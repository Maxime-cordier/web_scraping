On 3 January 2019, a Boeing 737-500 (5N-AIS) being operated by Azman Air on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt as AZM2316 experienced transient uncommanded right engine thrust variation accompanied by unexplained noises and indicated vibration increases en-route but these were not considered a reason to shut the engine down until it clearly and suddenly failed during an ILS approach at destination in day IMC. The now single engine approach was discontinued as was a subsequent one but a third approach was completed successfully half an hour after the second one.
