On 12 March 2013, an Airbus A320 (TS-IMC) being operated by Tunisair on a scheduled passenger flight from Djerba to Paris Orly landed normally on runway 08 at destination in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) but was unable to clear the runway after encountering a deterioration from the braking effectiveness encountered earlier on the snow and slush-covered surface. An overrun at taxi speed occurred and the aircraft came to a stop with the NLG off the runway but the MLG still on it. Passengers were disembarked to ground transport using steps positioned at the left hand rear door.
