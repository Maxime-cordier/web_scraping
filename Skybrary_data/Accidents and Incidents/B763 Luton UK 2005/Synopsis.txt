The following is an extract from the official Report on the Accident investigated by UK AAIB: "The aircraft had been pushed back, with engines running, and the ground handling crew was then asked to tow it forward. During the manoeuvre the towbar shear pins failed, the tug was braked to a stop and the aircraft ran into the tug. Ownership of the towbar was not clear and consequently it had not been maintained and was unserviceable. The ground crewâ€™s training had not prepared them for towing an aircraft forwards."
