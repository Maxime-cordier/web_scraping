The Report produces one Safety Recommendation. "It is recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority reminds AOC [Air Operator Certificate] holders of their responsibility to ensure that suitable curricula and standards are in place for the training and maintenance of competency of staff involved in the ground handling of commercial aircraft at airports and also that they should require a means of ensuring adherence to those standards. (Safety Recommendation 2006-118)".
