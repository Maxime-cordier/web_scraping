The cause of the accident is identified in the Report in the section addressing the lack of standardisation regarding the oversight of airport airside ground services: "This accident was the result of ground handling staff being asked to perform, at short notice, a relatively commonplace task. It was, however, unexpected and was a task for which they had not been trained. They were also using a towbar which was not maintained and which was unserviceable as a result of misunderstandings concerning its ownership. Since the push-back manoeuvre was a common one, it is considered that the training to perform it should have fallen into a defined minimum training package for ground staff qualified to handle aircraft in tug and towbar operations. There is no authority which ensures the adequacy of any training curriculum for ground handling staff, merely a general responsibility as defined in JAR-OPS."
