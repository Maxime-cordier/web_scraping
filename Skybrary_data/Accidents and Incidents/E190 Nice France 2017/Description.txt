On 6 November 2017, an Embraer ERJ190-100LR (CS-TPV) being operated by Portugalia on a scheduled international passenger flight from Nice to Lisbon lined up on the taxiway parallel to runway 04L and, when cleared, commenced takeoff on it without the TWR controller noticing. By the time he did notice, the aircraft had travelled about 550 metres and was continuing to accelerate above 85 knots at which point he cancelled the takeoff clearance and the aircraft stopped without any consequences. Ten minutes later, the flight departed from the runway and was completed without further event.
