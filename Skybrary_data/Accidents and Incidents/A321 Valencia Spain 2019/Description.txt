On 5 August 2019, an Airbus A321 (G-MEDN) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from London Heathrow to Valencia as BA422 was en route in day VMC when two annunciations of minor malfunctions in the right engine occurred, one of which was transient and the other required no action. Subsequently, a few minutes before landing at the destination, white smoke of undetermined origin began entering the passenger cabin and flight deck and oxygen masks were donned. Immediately after clearing the runway, a MAYDAY was declared after several system warnings potentially linked to the smoke were annunciated. There were no externally visible signs of fire but an emergency evacuation of all 183 occupants was promptly completed without any injuries.
