of fire. On completion of the ECAM Alert actions the Captain decided to evacuate the aircraft. This was accomplished using 6 of the 8 emergency exits with no injuries and buses were on hand to take everyone to the terminal where those who had been affected by smoke inhalation were provided with first aid. Three of these passengers (one adult and two children) were then taken to a local hospital and checked over before being discharged. Damage to the right engine was internal but various evidence of the consequences of its malfunctioning were visible externally including oil leaking directly from it and the slats on the right wing leaking oil from the engine bleed air ducts used to supply the wing anti-ice system. The chip detectors accessible by opening the right engine cowlings were found to be completely filled with ferrous debris. An initial boroscope inspection of the engine also found significant amounts of engine oil in the third stage of the High Pressure Compressor (HPC).
