The right IAE V2533-A5 engine was disassembled and sent to the manufacturer's facilities to undergo a thorough inspection. This found that the (eventual) complete loss of its oil which had been the source of contamination of the air conditioning system had been triggered by the failure of bearing number 3 in the (sealed) Front Bearing Compartment (FBC). In conjunction with the engine’s number 4 bearing, this bearing supports the high pressure rotor. It was not possible to determine when this bearing had begun to deteriorate but it was concluded that it could not be traced to any airworthiness-related non compliance. It was concluded that the bearing’s operating time/cycles, material, manufacture or assembly, “did not appear to have contributed to the failure”. The likely origin of the failure was considered to have been damage to the number 3 bearing due to rolling contact fatigue which had begun when spalling occurred between the outer race and the bearing balls. This had then caused wear as a result of frictional contact between the outer race and the bearing housing as a result of which the outer race then began to crack with parts released from it then damaging the bearing cage. The ‘ENG2 STALL’ message would have occurred when the damaged bearing was no longer able to control either the axial or radial position of the rotor. Although the engine “had recovered from this stall”, metallic debris from the breakup of the bearing resulted in the oil filter becoming clogged thereby activating the ‘ENG 2 OIL FILTER CLOG’ message. Only in the final stages of the flight, when the turning shaft lost its alignment had the hydraulic seal evidently fractured and allowed air from HPC to enter the FBC and oil to leak through the seal into the HPC. Although much of this oil would have passed through the engine, some would have been bled from the HPC into both the cabin air and anti-ice systems. Damage to bearing No. 3 [from official report]
