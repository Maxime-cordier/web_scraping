be desirable for such aircraft. This situation was considered to merit a study by the Airport Installation Manager on how to prevent a runway incursion by considering the visibility of the marked Holding Point. The Investigation formally determined that the Probable Causes of the Serious Incident were that “the departing Airbus A330-300 entered runway 34R across the Stop Line despite the instruction given to it by the Tower to hold short of this line and an Airbus A330-300, which had been given landing clearance for the same runway had to be instructed to go around” and that it was “somewhat likely that the departing A330 entered the runway when both its pilots failed to notice the Stop Line and the Runway Guard Lights because they were concentrating on operating the switches in the cockpit and forgot to pay attention to the outside”. The Final Report of the Serious Incident was adopted by the JTSB on 9 February 2018 and published on 27 March 2018. It was assessed as an ICAO Category ‘C’ severity event and no Safety Recommendations were made.
