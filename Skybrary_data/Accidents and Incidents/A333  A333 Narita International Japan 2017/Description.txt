On 14 February 2017, an Airbus A330-300 (HS-XTC) being operated by Thai AirAsia on a scheduled international passenger flight from Narita to Bangkok flight 607 failed to stop at the holding point of the active runway 34R in night VMC and when ATC realised this, another Airbus A330-300 (B-18361) being operated by China Airlines, which had been cleared to land on the same runway and was only about a mile from touchdown, was sent around.
