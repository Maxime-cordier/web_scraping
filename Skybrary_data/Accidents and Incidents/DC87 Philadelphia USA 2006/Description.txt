On 7 February 2006, a McDonnell Douglas DC8-70-71F (N748UP) being operated by United Parcel Service (UPS) on a scheduled cargo flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia as UPS 1307 and on a night visual approach at destination reported the illumination of a cargo smoke warning to TWR and the emergency services were alerted. Immediately after touchdown, rapidly thickening smoke entered the flight deck and the three crew evacuated the aircraft as soon as it came to a stop on the runway. It proved difficult to locate the source of the fire and impossible to prevent the eventual destruction of the aircraft by fire.
