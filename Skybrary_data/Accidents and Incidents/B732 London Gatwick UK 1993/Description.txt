On 20 October 1993, a Boeing 737-200 being operated by Air Malta on a scheduled passenger flight from Malta to London Gatwick landed at destination on the taxiway parallel to the runway for which landing clearance had been given in good visibility at night after a Surveillance Radar Approach (SRA) terminating at 2 miles from touchdown had been conducted in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). There was no damage to the aircraft or injury to the occupants and the aircraft taxied to the allocated gate after the landing.
