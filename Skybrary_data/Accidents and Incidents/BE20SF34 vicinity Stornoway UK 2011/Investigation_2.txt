SSR recording. It was noted that in the US, subscale settings below 30.00 inches are routinely passed with the first number omitted so that 29.90m inches would be passed as “990”. It was concluded that the C12 had actually set 29.90 inches Hg on their subscale. The formal statement of Cause was given as: “Having set the incorrect pressure on the altimeter subscale, the (C12) crew descended below their cleared altitude and into conflict with the SF340.” The ICAO AIRPROX Risk Category (the actual risk after any avoiding action) was assessed as ‘C’. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 28 June 2012. The following Safety Recommendation was made: that the UK CAA should issue a Safety Notice reminding controllers and pilots of the potential for confusion over the units of pressure, which could lead to incorrect altimeter subscale setting when the barometric pressure is below 1000hPa (or 30.00in Hg)..
