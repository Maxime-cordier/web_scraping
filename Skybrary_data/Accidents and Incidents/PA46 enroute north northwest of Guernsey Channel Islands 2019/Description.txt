On 21 January 2019, a privately operated Piper PA46-310P (N246DB) conducting a private international passenger flight from Nantes to Cardiff at night on a VFR flight plan began manoeuvring whilst in the cruise to maintain VMC. It then suddenly began to descending steeply and at high speed before disappearing from radar altogether in a position close to where the wreckage of the aircraft was subsequently located on the seabed, a discovery which confirmed breakup of the airframe prior to impact and fatal injuries to the two occupants.
