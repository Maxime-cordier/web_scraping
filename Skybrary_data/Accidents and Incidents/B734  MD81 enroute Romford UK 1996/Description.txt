On 12 November 1996 (the same day as the fatal mid air over New Delhi), a B737-400 descended below its assigned level in one of the holding patterns at London Heathrow, in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), to within 100 feet vertically and between 680 and 820 metres horizontally of a MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MD-81 at its correct level. Neither aircraft was fitted with Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS).
