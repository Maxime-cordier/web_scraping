On 18 April 2018, an Airbus 330-300 (N806 NW) being operated by Delta Air Lines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Atlanta to London Heathrow as DL30 with an augmented crew which included a Training Captain conducting a Line Check on the Operating Captain returned for an overweight landing after a right engine fire occurred shortly after a day VMC takeoff. Although it appeared that the fire had been successfully extinguished whilst airborne, it reignited and substantial damage was caused to the engine pylon. The aircraft was stopped on the runway after landing and with no fire propagation beyond the affected engine and pylon, the fire was extinguished and the aircraft then towed to the gate where the 288 occupants disembarked normally.
