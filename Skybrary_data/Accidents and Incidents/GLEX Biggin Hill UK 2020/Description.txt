On 17 September 2020, as a Bombardier Global 6000 (CS-GLD) being operated by Netjets Europe on a positioning flight from Edinburgh to Biggin Hill touched down at destination, the right wingtip touched the runway surface and was damaged although the landing roll was completed without further event and with no injuries to the four crew occupants.
