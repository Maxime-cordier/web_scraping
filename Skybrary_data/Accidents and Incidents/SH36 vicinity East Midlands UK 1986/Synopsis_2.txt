to operate the boots. From experience gained over many years, de-icing boots are not used until there is a visible build-up of ice on the leading edges of the wings and tail. The reason for not doing so is that a thin layer of rime ice may not be brittle enough to fracture and may not shed effectively. As to Cause of the accident, the Report states: The accident most probably occurred as a result of the effects of a significant accumulation of airframe ice degrading the aircraft’s stability and control characteristics, such that the crew were unable to maintain control…Turbulence and or downdraught may have contributed to the accident.. Other contributory factors were the difficulty in detecting clear ice at night on the SD3-60 which resulted in the airframe de-icing system not being used.. The delay in application of go-around power may have also contributed to the accident.. The Safety Recommendations in the report included the recommendation that: Pneumatically inflated wing and tail de-icing systems be exercised during the final approach to land, when an aircraft is flying, or has recently flown in conditions conductive to the accretion of ice..
