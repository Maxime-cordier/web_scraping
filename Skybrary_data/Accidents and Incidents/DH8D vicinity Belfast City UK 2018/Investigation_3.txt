When 'ALT SEL' was selected, the crew did not confirm that 'GA', 'HDG', and 'ALT SEL' were displayed on the PFD. Instead 'ALT' mode was active and displayed which led to a target altitude of 0 feet amsl being set, resulting in a descent when the autopilot was engaged. Timely warnings of the hazardous flight path were provided by the EGPWS and prompt corrective action by the PF returned the aircraft to safe flight..
