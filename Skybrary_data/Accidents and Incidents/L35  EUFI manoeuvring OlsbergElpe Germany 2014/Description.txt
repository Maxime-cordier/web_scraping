On 23 June 2014 a Learjet 35A being operated out of Hohn by a civilian contractor as part of a German Air Force interception and identification training exercise involving two Eurofighters from Nörvenich collided with the lead Eurofighter in day VMC conditions as it began a follow-me manoeuvre at 8000 feet. The Learjet crew lost control and were both killed and the aircraft was destroyed by impact with the terrain. The Eurofighter was also damaged but after the pilot had declared a MAYDAY, he was able to successfully recover the aircraft back to Nörvenich.
