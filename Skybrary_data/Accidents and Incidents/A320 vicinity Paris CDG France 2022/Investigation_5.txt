without delay that controllers strictly use the standard phraseology in case of an MSAW and provide the QNH information. [FRAN-2022-007]. that Paris-Charles de Gaulle Air Traffic Services implement without delay a procedure for controllers to mitigate the risk of an incorrect QNH being used by flight crews during approaches using the baro-VNAV function, possibly by repeating the QNH at an appropriate time during the approach. [FRAN-2022-008]. that Airhub Airlines ensure without delay that their flight crews are made aware of the importance of the QNH setting for approaches using the baro-VNAV function, with respect to the risk of CFIT. [FRAN-2022-009]. that Airhub Airlines implement without delay a procedure to mitigate the risks of an incorrect QNH setting affecting both altimeters during approaches using the baro-VNAV function, possibly by cross-checking the QNH with another source of information, in particular with the ATIS information when available or by asking the controller for confirmation of the QNH. [FRAN-2022-010]. Further investigative effort is now being made into, but not limited to the following: non-activation of the EGPWS,. annunciation of radio-altimeter height auto-callouts on the flight deck,. the settings and configuration of the MSAW system at CDG,. MSAW phraseology,. flight crew and air traffic controller training and procedures,. flight crew and air traffic controller performance,. additional ground and onboard systems to prevent CFIT during approaches using the baro-VNAV function,. safety impact assessments associated with the ICAO PBN plan and its regional and national adaptations,. similar events,. aircraft manufacturersâ€™ operational documentation for approaches using the baro-VNAV function.. The Preliminary Report was simultaneously published in both English and definitive French language versions on 12 July 2022.
