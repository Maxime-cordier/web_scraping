On 23 May 2022, an Airbus A320 (9H-EMU) being operated by Airhub Airlines for Norwegian Air Sweden on a scheduled international passenger flight from Stockholm to Paris CDG as NSZ4431 made a go around from its day IMC RNP approach to runway 27R at destination during which it came within a recorded 6 feet of terrain without any flight crew visual reference. A further similar approach was then flown using the same incorrect altimeter subscale setting but this time, weather conditions had improved and after becoming visual, the aircraft was then positioned onto the correct vertical profile for an uneventful landing. MSAW activations occurred during both approaches but there were apparently no on aircraft EGPWS activations. A total of 178 occupants were on board.
