minor injuries to one of the passengers had been the subject of a BFU Factual Investigation. Safety Action was taken as follows: Aerologic strengthened its procedural instructions for taxi out by stipulating taxiing with synchronous thrust of all engines at all times. Airport Operator FRAport advised an intention to strengthen the respective chapter of the AIP with the addition of the following text: “Aircraft may taxi on the apron only with the absolutely required minimum engine thrust. As a matter of principle, when taxiing (especially in turns) attention should be paid to engine thrust which has to be as synchronous as possible for all operating engines.” The Final Report was completed on 22 December 2022 and published the following month. No Safety Recommendations were made.
