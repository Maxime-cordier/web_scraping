least one HPC blade and vane, with one crack propagating to failure. This resulted in secondary damage to the engine and surging on take-off.. On the basis of the findings of the Investigation, the ATSB formally documented Safety Messages as follows: Tool control is an important part of maintenance processes that ensures they do not lead to foreign object damage. Small and seemingly insignificant tool components can, and have, caused significant incidents or accidents. Tool control should extend to pseudo-consumable items such as screwdriver tips and drill bits. Modern (flight crew) training methods include the use of high-fidelity training devices such as full motion flight simulators. Their design aims to maximise the realism of an artificial environment. However, there is a limit to their ability to replicate extreme events. Flight crew should be aware that the noise and vibration from an actual engine failure may be greater than, or different to, that experienced during simulator training and this could contribute to the effects of startle. The Final Report was released on 16 August 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
