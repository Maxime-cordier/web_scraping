On 23 October 2020, a V2500-powered Airbus A320 (VH-VFF) being operated by Jetstar Airways on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Brisbane to Cairns in normal day visibility made a low speed rejected takeoff when directional control became difficult as the aircraft accelerated and alerts advising a malfunction of the right engine subsequently appeared. Observers and some of the passengers subsequently reported having seen flames emitted from the right engine as the takeoff roll commenced.
