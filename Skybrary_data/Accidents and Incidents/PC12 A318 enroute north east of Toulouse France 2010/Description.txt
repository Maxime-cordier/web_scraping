On 2 June 2010, an Airbus A318 (F-GUGJ) being operated by Air France on a scheduled passenger flight from Lyon to Toulouse was about 90nm northeast of Toulouse when it came into very close proximity in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) with a Pilatus PC12 (EC-ISH) being operated by Norestair SL on a non revenue positioning flight from Buochs, Switzerland to San Sebastian, Spain which was travelling on the same track and in the same direction. A last minute sighting enabled a slight descent and divergent turn to be made. There was no Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) activation on either aircraft and the minimum separation after the avoiding action was estimated at between 15 and 30 metres horizontally and about 100 feet vertically.
