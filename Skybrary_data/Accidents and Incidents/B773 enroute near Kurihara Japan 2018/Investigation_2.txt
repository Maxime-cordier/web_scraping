the turbulence which led to the injury had occurred showed that a cold front was approaching from the northwest and a vertical cross section of the flight track at the time of the occurrence (see below) indicated that there had been a jet stream with a maximum speed of around 150 knots centred at FL370. It was concluded on the available evidence that the clear air turbulence encountered had occurred whilst the aircraft “was passing through the side edge of the jet stream” and that the associated vertical wind shear had increased in strength compared to that forecast in the pre-flight briefing. The Probable Cause of the investigated Serious Incident was formally determined as the encounter by the aircraft with clear air turbulence while it was passing through the side edge of a jet stream which led to such sudden and severe flight path disturbance that a cabin attendant who was in the aisle towards the rear of the aircraft fell and was injured. The precise origin of the clear air turbulence was probably the existence of a region of vertical wind shear on the flight route of the aircraft which was stronger than that contained in the forecast consulted prior to commencing the flight. Safety Action taken by Japan Airlines as a result of this event and known to the Investigation was noted as having included but not been limited to the following: Aircrew have been reminded that the flight plan for the route does not take bad weather conditions into account unless this is explicitly advised on the pre-flight briefing memo and that flight plan altitudes are based on those which would consume fuel most effectively.. Cabin Crew guidance in respect of requests to flight crew relating to the operation of the seat belt sign has been added to the existing instructions in “guidelines for operation of the seat belt sign”.. The Final Report was adopted by the JTSB on 30 August 2019 and published on 26 September 2019. No Safety Recommendations were made.
