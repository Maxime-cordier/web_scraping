Investigation were also formally issued as follows: that the Aircraft Operator and its Maintenance Organisations should - together with the continuing airworthiness management organisation (CAMO) - review and improve their existing processes to ensure the traceability of maintenance work and unambiguous spare parts management.[No 25]. that the Aircraft Operator should provide retraining for its flight crews with specific regard to discipline, compliance with rules and in particular safe flying practices in mountainous areas and the application of the basic principles of flying.[No 32]. that the Aircraft Operator should optimise collaboration among its flight crews (crew resource management) to meet the specific requirements of its operations (VFR flights, flights in mountainous areas, extensive experience, equal rank, etc.).[No 33]. that the Aircraft Operator should develop and implement management and monitoring measures to detect and ensure compliance with basic safety principles and legal requirements.[No 34]. that the Aircraft Operator should improve its internal processes, specifically those in relation to quality assurance and risk management, in order to allow the timely identification and targeted resolution of safety issues.[No 35]. that the Aircraft Operator should perform the missing incident and risk assessments and ensure that in the event of engine failure and when flying in mountainous areas, appropriate flight planning and route selection will allow for all flights to be completed safely without fail.[No 36]. that the Aircraft Operator should document critical flight conditions for realistic operational situations and make its pilots as familiar as possible with critical flight conditions.[No 37]. The Final Report was approved on 22 December 2020 and subsequently published in English translation and in the definitive German language version on 28 January 2021. It was noted that the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) expects that aircraft operations by Ju-Air will remain suspended “for a prolonged period of time”.
