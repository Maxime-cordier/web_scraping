for a range of short circuit impedances and will be implemented as a modification to all GGPCUs.. Airbus issued (on 1 October 2011) a revision to the relevant troubleshooting procedure which requires an insulation check of the excitation line circuit to be performed. This circuit includes the Main Excitation Cable.. Four Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Airbus review the design of the lightning protection system to prevent short circuiting of the feeder cables when excessive voltage is output by the Variable Frequency Generator [Recommendation R-2012-002]. that Airbus review the need for fire detection and suppression in the vicinity of the feeder terminal block. [Recommendation R-2012-003]. that the European Aviation Safety Agency require Airbus to review the design of the lightning protection system to prevent short circuiting of the feeder cables when excessive voltage is output by the Variable Frequency Generator. [Recommendation R-2012-004]. that the European Aviation Safety Agency require Airbus to review the need for fire detection and suppression in the vicinity of the feeder terminal block. [Recommendation R-2012-005]. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 2 October 2012.
