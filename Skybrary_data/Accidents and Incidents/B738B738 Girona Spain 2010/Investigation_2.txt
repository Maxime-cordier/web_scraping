when overtaking the stop bar involved in this collision would be greater if the stationary aircraft was positioned to the right of the stop bar and overtaken on the left whereas the reverse applied in this case.. It could not be determined whether the stationary aircraft was positioned with its nose section over the stop bar and its longitudinal axis exactly atop the taxiway centreline (the position that, in theory, it should have had) or whether the overtaking aircraft was accurately following the marked taxiway line (which it should have been).. The Investigation determined that cause of the collision was a combination of two factors: the misjudgment on the part of the crew of (the overtaking) aircraft of the distance separating their left wingtip and the nearest part of the stationary aircraft (the right edge of the horizontal stabilizer).. the decreased room available for overtaking in the transition zone between the taxiway and the holding area at the head of the runway as a consequence of having moved the stop bar backward.. Two Safety Recommendations were made: That AENA report changes to markings affecting airport operations, as well as of any possible consequences to aircraft operations, as soon as possible via the method deemed most suitable, such as the issuing of a NOTAM, whenever the publication of the AIP that details said changes is delayed. (REC 05/11). That AENA review the risk analysis methods of the safety studies it conducts so as to ensure that said analyses consider the risks to both air navigation activities and airport infrastructure. In particular, an additional margin shall be included before the stop bar or hold point for the pilot to stop and from which he can see the stop bar or hold point. For a 4-C category airplane, this distance shall be approximately 5 m. (REC 06/11). The Final Report Report IN-001/2010 was approved on 21 February 2011.
