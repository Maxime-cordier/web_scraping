On 25 August 2002, a Douglas DC9-51 being operated by North West Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Toronto to Minneapolis had just taken off in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when a Cessna 206 being operated on a passenger charter flight from Georgian Bay to Toronto unexpectedly carried out a missed approach from another runway. And despite last minute visual avoiding action came within close airborne proximity whilst still within the airport perimeter. There were no injuries to any of the 109 occupants of the DC9 or the 4 occupants of the Cessna.
