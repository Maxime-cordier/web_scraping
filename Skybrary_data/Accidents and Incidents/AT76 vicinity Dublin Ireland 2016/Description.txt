On 2 September 2016, an ATR72-600 (EI-FAW) being operated by Stobart Air for Aer Lingus on a scheduled international passenger flight from Edinburgh to Dublin and cleared to join the ILS localiser for runway 28 at Dublin in day VMC not below 2000 feet continued descending without clearance to just over 1000 feet above runway threshold elevation when approaching 5 nm from touchdown before beginning a go around prompted by ATC querying the flightâ€™s altitude following the triggering of an MSAW alert. Radar vectoring to a further ILS approach to land was uneventful.
