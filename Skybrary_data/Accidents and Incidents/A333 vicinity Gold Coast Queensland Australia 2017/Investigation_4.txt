minutes and to a commanded shutdown after approximately 4 minutes.. The affected engine subsequently failed necessitating a return to land.. The small size of the bird meant that it should not have been able to cause sufficient damage to require the affected engine to be shutdown according to applicable engine certification standards.. This event “appeared to involve a rare scenario comprising a combination of aircraft and engine speeds, the height of the fan blade at which the bird strike occurred and its angle of incidence”.. It is “extremely unlikely that such a scenario would occur on multiple engines simultaneously”.. Safety Action taken by Rolls Royce as a result of the investigated event whilst the Investigation was in progress were recorded as having included deciding that its Trent 700 project team will review the design of the fan rear seal and the low pressure roller bearing bolts to determine if there is a feasible solution to prevent the loss of a small section of fan blade leading imminently to an engine shutdown. The Final Report was released on 2 May 2018. No Safety Recommendations were made.
