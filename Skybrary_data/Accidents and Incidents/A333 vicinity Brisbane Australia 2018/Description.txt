On 18 July 2018, an Airbus A330-300 (9M-MTK) being operated by Malaysia Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur as MH 134 got airborne in night VMC at approximately 175 knots despite the fact that neither pilot had any airspeed indications throughout the 45 second takeoff roll. Thereafter, it took an hour to resolve the resultant aircraft control flight management problems and complete a return to an overweight landing which was accompanied by minor damage to the main landing gear bay doors caused by runway surface contact due to their non-retraction after free-fall landing gear extension had been necessary.
