An Investigation into this Serious Incident was carried out by the Safety Investigation Authority of Finland (SIAF). Relevant data were downloaded from both the CVR and DFDR. The former ceased recording when the engines were shut down even though it should have continued recording for a further five minutes but provided useful information about the interphone conversations between the flight and cabin crew during the event. The DFDR provided useful information about aircraft systems and the manner they were used and also included the exact time when the aircraft doors were opened and when the engines were shut down. It did not record any smoke or fire warnings. Various other logs and recordings of communications between those involved in the response were also available as were airport CCTV recordings and photographs taken by passengers. The Captain stated that he had been flying A320 family aircraft for 8 years and prior to that Airbus A310 aircraft for 15 years and that he had a total of approximately 18,000 hours flying experience. The First Officer was A320/A330 rated and stated that she had also been flying A320 family aircraft for 8 years, prior to that had flown the ATR42, Boeing 737 and Airbus A310 and had a total of approximately 13,000 hours flying experience.
