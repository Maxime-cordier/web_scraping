On 3 August 2018, an Airbus A319 (OK-PET) being operated by Czech Airlines on an international passenger flight from Helsinki to Prague as OK 481 was taxiing for departure from runway 22R when the cabin crew became aware of smoke in the cabin. As it intensified, the Captain was notified and after stopping the aircraft agreed that an emergency evacuation should be performed. It was then initiated by the cabin crew but proceeded in a disorderly manner which extended the time taken and placed evacuated passengers at risk. A total of 26 of the 135 passengers sustained minor injuries during the evacuation.
