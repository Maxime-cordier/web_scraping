On 9 January 2020, a Fokker 100 (VH-NHY) being operated by Network Aviation for Qantas Link on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Perth to Newman overran the wet destination landing runway by 70 metres after touchdown in the presence of both a strong crosswind and moderate rain. There were no occupant injuries and only minor aircraft damage resulted.
