exists) to uncontrolled aerodromes where moderate or heavy rain is reported or observed.. In October 2020, the CASA published an update to the CAAP 235-05 Section 3 on Landing Distance which included guidance on landing in very wet conditions including a reference to the FAA SAFO 19003 where it identified moderate active precipitation and ungrooved runways as being “risks to landing performance”.. On the basis of the findings of the Investigation, the ATSB formally documented a Safety Message as follows: Active precipitation, particularly moderate to heavy rainfall, is one of many factors that can influence the stopping distance of an aircraft. Water on a runway that is not grooved can significantly reduce the ability of the aircraft to slow down. In wet weather, additional conservatism is encouraged when calculating the required landing distances. Operators and pilots are encouraged to review the latest guidance and tools available in relation to maintaining safety on runways and the factors that cause runway overruns. The Final Report was released on 1 September 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
