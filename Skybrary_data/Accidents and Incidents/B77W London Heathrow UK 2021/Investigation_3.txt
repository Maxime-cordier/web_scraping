evacuation slides (see below), since this is “very much directed at a situation with passengers on board” and it was considered by the Captain that its use as scripted “may have only added confusion rather than giving a clear direction”.. The OM Part ‘B’ also included a procedure for a Rapid Disembarkation using normal egress (as was appropriate to the circumstances) but this assumed that passengers were on board and involved calling the SCCM to the flight deck for a briefing prior to making a PA to passengers to exit the aircraft without delay. In the circumstances, the use of the Relief First Officer to directly communicate an instruction to the cabin crew to leave the aircraft promptly was considered to have been effective.. The formally documented Conclusion of the Investigation was as follows: This Serious Incident occurred when a short circuit in the battery pack of a refrigerated container loaded in the aircraft aft cargo hold caused heating of cables in the pack and, therefore, smoke to be produced. The smoke was detected by the aircraft fire detection systems and a fire cargo aft warning was triggered. The crew disembarked through the boarding door. Safety Action The container manufacturer indicated that they would be considering whether the battery support frame, which had been partially detached by the impact which had occurred prior to or during loading, should be modified to improve the functionality and safety of the container.. The aircraft operator indicated they would be considering whether to introducing a specific pre-loading damage check on all similar containers before they are loaded onto aircraft.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 9 December 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
