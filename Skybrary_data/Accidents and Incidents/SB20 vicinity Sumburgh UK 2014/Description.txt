On 15 December 2014, a Saab 2000 (G-LGNO) being operated by Loganair on a Flybe-branded scheduled domestic passenger flight from Aberdeen to Sumburgh was struck by lightning shortly after discontinuing an ILS approach at destination at night in IMC. A MAYDAY was declared and acknowledged on account of the lighting strike and an interlude, during which the crew suspected that the strike had compromised aircraft pitch control, followed with loss of control and a rapid dive at high speed occurred to 1,100 feet over the sea with recovery only commenced after EGPWS 'PULL UP' and 'SINK RATE' warnings had occurred. A diversion back to Aberdeen was then flown without further event. There were no injuries to any of the 33 occupants and only superficial airframe damage consequent to the lightning strike.
