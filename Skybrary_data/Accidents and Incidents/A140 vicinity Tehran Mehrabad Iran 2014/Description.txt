On 10 August 2014, the Number 2 engine of an Antonov 140-100 (EP-GPA) being operated by Sepahan Airlines from Tehran Mehrabad to Tabas as flight 5915 failed just as the aircraft was about to become airborne from runway 9L. Once airborne, the aircraft was seen to diverge to the right of the runway centreline but reached only a low height before descending, right wing down, and crashing within a nearby industrial complex. The effects of the impact and a post crash fire destroyed the aircraft and 40 of the 48 occupants, including all 6 crew members, died at the time of the crash or subsequently from the injuries sustained in it. The remaining 8 occupants sustained serious injuries but survived. Some collateral damage to structures and trees at the crash site occurred.
