an emergency, neither the pilot nor ATC declared an emergency. No causes to the accident nor safety recommendations are given in the Report. Notes of the SKYbrary editor ^ To ensure consistency with existing SKYbrary material the acronyms UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) are used in this article although in the original NTSB Report (CHI06MA121) the unpiloted aircraft is referred as UA (unmanned aircraft); The term UAS has emerged as successor to the earlier term UAV in recognition of the fact that a UAV itself is merely a part of the system which is required to operate the unmanned aircraft..
