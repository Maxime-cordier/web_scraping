On 10 June 2018, a Boeing 737-800 (PH-BXG) being operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Amsterdam to Munich, which was being used for line training with an observing Safety Pilot and taking off from Amsterdam in day VMC, only just became airborne before the end of the runway was reached during a reduced thrust takeoff. The event was not reported to the operator who only discovered evidence of it during routine analysis of operational flight data almost three months later after which it was notified to the State Investigation Agency.
