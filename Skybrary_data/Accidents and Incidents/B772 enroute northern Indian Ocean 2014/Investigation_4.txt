during the conduct of and known to the Investigation included the following: Singapore Airlines replaced the incident aircraft’s FQIS components including the Fuel Quantity Processing Unit, the fuel tank sensors and the Program Switch Module.. The Contractor responsible for Overseeing Refuelling implemented a one-time refuelling refresher training and competency assessments for various aircraft types which included practical training on taking magnastick readings using a fuel tank simulator training tool.. Boeing upgraded subsequent versions of the FQPU to be able to detect and prevent incorrect program pins configuration and after reviewing the potential safety concerns raised by the FQIS referencing an incorrect aircraft model, namely, runway overrun in a rejected take-off scenario and insufficient climb capability, determined that a sufficient safety margin would exist in both scenarios such that no action was necessary. The Company also concluded that it was “not necessary to put in place an aircraft safety system that could detect or alert the flight crew or maintenance crew when there is a mismatch between the aircraft model referenced by the FQIS and the actual aircraft model".. Three Safety Recommendations were issued as follows: that the Aircraft Maintenance Service Provider Involved should require the magnastick check to be performed by two qualified personnel independently. [TSIB Recommendation RA-2018-012]. that the Singapore Civil Aviation Authority should consider requiring aircraft maintenance service providers to have magnastick checks performed by two qualified personnel independently. [TSIB Recommendation RA-2018-013]. that the Aircraft Maintenance Service Provider Involved should consider the need for refresher training on magnastick checks to be conducted for personnel at a suitable time interval. [TSIB Recommendation RA-2018-014]. The Final Report of the Investigation was issued on 12 June 2018.
