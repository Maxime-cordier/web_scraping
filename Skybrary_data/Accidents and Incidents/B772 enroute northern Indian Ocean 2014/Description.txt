On 16 April 2014, the crew of a Boeing 777-200ER (9V-SWC) being operated by Singapore Airlines on a flight from Singapore to Johannesburg at night and level at FL320 were presented with an EICAS fuel system annunciation which highlighted a discrepancy between the fuel remaining figure derived from fuel used assuming the departure fuel had been as indicated and the figure derived by directly measuring the fuel remaining in tanks. The crew had been assured prior to departure that despite evidence of an excessive fuel uplift, the required fuel load was onboard. When the difference in flight was observed to be increasing, a precautionary and uneventful return to Singapore was made and a manual check of fuel on board revealed that there had been a 41 tonne overload.
