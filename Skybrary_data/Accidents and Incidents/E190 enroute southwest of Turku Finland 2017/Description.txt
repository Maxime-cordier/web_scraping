On 3 December 2017, an Embraer E190-100LR (OH-LKE) being operated for Finnair by their subsidiary Nordic Regional Airlines (Norrra) as FIN4NR on a scheduled international passenger flight from Helsinki to Gothenburg was in the cruise at FL310 in unrecorded night flying conditions having already initiated a return to Helsinki due to an intensifying burning smell when a similar report and the presence of smoke was reported from the cabin and smoke and a PACK FAIL annunciation occurred in the flight deck. A MAYDAY was declared to ATC reporting “fire on board” and an ATC-suggested diversion to Turku was accepted. Both pilots went onto oxygen and the situation did not worsen in flight but a precautionary emergency evacuation was ordered after landing when the cabin crew reported that the smoke was increasing again. No evidence of fire was subsequently found and the 104 occupants were unaffected by the fumes and uninjured during the evacuation but there were delays in both ground transport and a count of those evacuated.
