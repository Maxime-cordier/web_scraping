On 25 March 2008 a Boeing 747-300 being operated by Air Atlanta Icelandic under a wet lease to Saudi Arabian Airlines on a passenger flight from Medina, Saudia Arabia to Dhaka was on the daylight landing roll on runway 14 at destination in normal ground visibility when a fire broke out in the vicinity of the No 3 engine and pylon. The aircraft was stopped at the beginning of the taxiway at the end of the runway and, when the fire could not be extinguished by crew action, an emergency evacuation was initiated and all 325 occupants exited with an estimated 17 minor injuries incurred. Although the Rescue and Fire Fighting Services did eventually extinguish the fire, the airframe damage was such that the aircraft was declared to be beyond economic repair.
