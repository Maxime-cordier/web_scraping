On 23 March 2019, an Airbus A320 (HA-LPL) being operated by Wizz Air which was fully loaded for a scheduled passenger flight from Bristol to Katowice was about to be pushed back from its stand in normal night visibility by a 'towbarless' tug when a significant jolt was apparent to the flight crew. The pushback did not commence and after the aircraft nose leg was found to have sustained impact damage, the aircraft was declared unfit to be operated and the occupants were disembarked.
