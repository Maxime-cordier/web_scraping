qualified ramp trainer. Although the way in which the damage to the aircraft had been caused - incorrect alignment of the tug lifting paddles - was established, the Investigation concluded that “it is not clear why the event occurred” although it was “possible that a momentary lapse in concentration led to the system being aligned to the nose leg rather than the nose wheels”, an error which it was considered would have been “likely to have gone unnoticed because the 10° to 15° offset of the nose wheels was not significant enough to indicate a problem”. It was further observed that “aligning with the nose wheels is vital” when pushing back with towbarless tugs, since lining up instead with the nose gear leg can “lead to misalignments of up to 25 cm” and such misalignment may then cause “significant damage to the components on the lower articulated part of the nose landing gear on this and many other aircraft types”. Safety Action taken by the ground handling contractor involved as a result of the investigated event was noted as having included the following: Towbarless tug training now specifically emphasises the need for the tug to be aligned with the nosewheels before attachment occurs.. Pushback crews have been briefed to be more aware of the importance of the nosewheel position and have been asked to make the aircraft crew aware that, where possible, the aircraft should be parked with its nosewheels aligned with the fore-axis of the aircraft.. As the A320 has been identified as potentially the aircraft type most susceptible to nose landing gear damage when the TLD 200MT tug is used, to the extent possible, either a conventional tow bar and tug or the TLD 100E towbarless tug will now be used with this aircraft type.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 10 October 2019. No Safety Recommendations were made.
