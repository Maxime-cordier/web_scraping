[2010 – 007]. that the Nigerian CAA should ensure that Operators’ Operations Manual/Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), which guide crew decisions in times of adverse weather and potentially hazardous atmospheric conditions, be designed to be explicit to the crew before such manuals are approved. [2010 – 008]. that the Nigerian CAA should ensure improvement in the procedure for screening and authentication of foreign licences of personnel before such licenses are re-validated.
