On 2 June 2012, a Dornier 328-100 (HB-AES) being operated by SkyWork Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Bern to Belgrade as SRK700 and taking off from Bern in normal day visibility came very close to colliding with a Robinson R44 helicopter (HB-ZSA) being operated by locally-based helicopter charter and pilot training company Mountainflyers 80 which had been cleared to hover taxi in the opposite direction parallel to the runway prior to departure on a Visual Flight Rules (VFR) sightseeing flight from and returning to Bern.
