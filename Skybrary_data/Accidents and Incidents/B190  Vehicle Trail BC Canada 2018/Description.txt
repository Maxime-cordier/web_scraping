On 12 December 2018, a Beechcraft 1900 (C-GIPC) being operated by Pacific Coastal Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Vancouver to Trail as PCO451 had just made a daylight touchdown on the 1219 metre-long destination runway 16 when the crew saw a runway inspection vehicle coming towards them and applied maximum braking allowing the vehicle to exit four seconds before they passed the exit position.
