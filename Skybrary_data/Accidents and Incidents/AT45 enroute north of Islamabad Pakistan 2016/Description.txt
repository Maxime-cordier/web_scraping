On 7 December 2016, an ATR42-500 (AP-BHO) being operated by Pakistan International Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Chitral to Islamabad crashed en-route in day VMC after the crew were unable to retain control when their attempt to shut down the malfunctioning left engine was complicated by unrelated faults which then prevented the normal operation of the propeller feathering mechanism. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and an intense post-impact fire and all 47 persons on board were killed.
