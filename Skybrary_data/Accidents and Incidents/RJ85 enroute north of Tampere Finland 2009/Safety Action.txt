It was noted that following the incident, Blue 1 had considered introducing a policy of always keeping the main fuel tanks as full as possible but had considered this impractical because of the additional expense and potential operational limitations of such a practice. Instead, it was decided that all refuelling of their Avro RJ fleet at Helsinki during the months between November and March inclusive should include the systematic use of an anti-icing additive. Blue 1 also introduced additional water draining to supplement the ones already being carried our during Weekly Checks It was also noted that BAE Systems has changed the minimum recommended fuel temperature for fuel tank water draining in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual to -1°C from the previous value of -5°C and had carried out a review of the failure-specific check-list involved in the investigated event in recognition of an opportunity to improve its clarity. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the EASA oblige BAE Systems Limited, the aircraft manufacturer, to make the Feed Tank Low Level checklist easier to use.. It was also considered (although it was not the subject of a formal safety recommendation) that “pursuant to ICAO Annex 6, Operators must see to it that the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) recording is stored for the purpose of safety investigation after each occurrence related to the safety of aviation.” The Final Report C1/2010L was completed on 4 October 2012 and an ‘abridged’ English language version was subsequently made available by the Safety Investigation Authority. It was noted that operation of this aircraft type by Blue 1 had ceased as previously planned in September 2011.
