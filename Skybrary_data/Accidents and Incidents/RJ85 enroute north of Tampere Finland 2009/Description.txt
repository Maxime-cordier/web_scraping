On 17 December 2009, an Avro RJ85 being operated by Blue 1 on a scheduled domestic passenger flight at night from Vaasa to Hesinki was climbing above FL200 when the first of a succession of fuel feed warnings was annunciated. Contrary to the applicable Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) drill, the flight was completed as planned without actual fuel starvation occurring.
