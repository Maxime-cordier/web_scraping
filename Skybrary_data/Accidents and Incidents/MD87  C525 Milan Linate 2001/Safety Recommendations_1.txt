A total of 18 Safety Recommendations were issued as a result of the Investigation as follows: Six were published in the Second Interim Report on 9 July 2002: That ENAC (Italian CAA) and ENAV (Italian Civil ANSP) mandate that the ICAO requirements regarding the usage of the English language shall be enforced and that its abidance shall be monitored. It is also felt necessary that standard read back procedures are enforced (ICAO Annex 10, paragraph 5.2.1.8 - Exchange of communications 5.2.1.8.2.2 PANS) (and enforce) the new ICAO recommended procedure that calls for explicit clearance to be issued when “runways crossings” are involved and containing explicit mention of the runway denomination of the runway to be engaged (ICAO DOC 4444 and Doc 9432-An/925 “Manual of Radiotelephony”) (with) exceptions….confined to situations that emanate from a typical domestic only traffic and/or that the usage of the domestic language would facilitate handling of an emergency situation. [17/113-1/A/02]. That ENAC should check that the state of airport Visual Aids of all domestic airports as well as the published taxi procedures is in accordance to published AIP. All information shall be unequivocal and in conformity with Internationally adopted standards (ICAO Annex 14); furthermore such correspondence shall be reflected in Operators documentation. [18/113-2/A/02]. That ENAC and ENAV should adopt procedures to systematically report any incident or abnormal operation in breach of Safety. Registration of such events should be monitored by ENAC with a view to updating and enhancing the quality of procedures and their compliance by all concerned, to achieve and maintain adequate Operational Safety. [19/113-3/A/02]. That ENAC and ENAV should mandate increased training and recurrent training of all Air Traffic Controllers, necessary to validate individual continuing proficiency for the task required for ATC. [20/113-4/A/02]. That ENAC and ENAV adopt the model clearly defined in the ICAO Aerodrome Design Manual for the denomination of all elements of the airport movement area. Such model shall allow the implementation of “standard taxi routings” containing all necessary information to air crews (denomination, routing, compulsory stop points). Such model should be adoptable by all airports. ENAV should further ensure that Stop bar lights (are) controlled by GND Controllers in respect of On/Off control function, as described in ICAO Annex 14. [21/113-5/A/02]. That ENAC and ENAV apply the same regulations, now compulsory for Commercial aircraft, to all aircraft involved in Low Visibility Operations (LVO-CAT II-III, LVTO). [22/113-6/A/02]. And a further 12 were published in the Final Report on 20 January 2004: That the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport as national competent Authority (should) work in the international air transport organisations (for) a full and quick implementation of the European Action Plan for Prevention of Runway Incursions. [1/113-7/A/04]. That the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and ENAC as national competent Authority should ensure that the design and operation of all (Italian) Aerodromes (is) in compliance with the safety standards as specified in ICAO Annex 14. [1/113-8/A/04]. That the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and ENAC as national competent Authority, (should) ensure that all
