during day 2 of his line training had been “at the minimum company standard expected for someone at his stage of training and with his experience (but that) the policy to continue flight training with an experienced Training Captain from a long runway had been deemed appropriate”. It was noted that the applicable OFDM programme monitored “average rotation rates” on a monthly basis and that the operator had no current concern on those data on their Boeing 737 fleet. The formally-stated Conclusion of the Investigation was as follows: "On takeoff, during a line training flight, the trainee co-pilot rotated the aircraft too rapidly causing the aircraft’s tail to strike the runway. The trainee had experienced disjointed training due to public health restrictions, which is likely to have made it harder to learn and retain the correct takeoff technique. During his first few sectors on the aircraft, it had been noted that his rotation rate was slightly slow, and he was allowing the rotation to stagnate. It is likely that trying to correct these issues contributed to the rapid rotation rate. The crosswind on the takeoff might have further added to co-pilot’s workload." Safety Action taken by TUI Airways was noted as having included re-emphasising to its Training Captains the need for caution when conditions are not suitable for low experienced trainees to operate as Pilot Flying during the takeoff and landing, even if this results in the training objectives for that flight not being achieved. It had also taken action to ensure better training continuity. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 11 August 2022.
