of the 767 and he advised that at the appropriate time, he had instructed one loader to remove the NLG chocks and 4 others to remove the MLG chocks whilst he was standing near to the NLG in order to attach the tow bar to the push back tractor. He also claimed that he had subsequently instructed two loaders to act as wing walkers but that the pushback was started before they were in position, which directly contradicted the statement made by both these loaders who said that “They were not given directions for performing the wing walker function”. It was noted that had wing walkers been in position prior to commencement of the pushback then the collision would have been avoided. The Investigation determined that the Probable Cause of the Accident was “incorrect stand allocation made by aerodrome personnel without following Standard Operating procedures (SOP)”. One Contributory Factor was also identified as “the non-availability of wing walkers during the pushback of the 767 aircraft”. Four Safety Recommendations were made as follows: that Delhi International Airport should take appropriate action in respect of the lapses of their personnel in allocating aircraft stands. that Delhi International Airport should modify the Airport Operations Control Centre’s Universal Flight Information System in view of all conflicts, stand blocking being reflected in the same colour code. that the DGCA take appropriate action in respect of Delhi International Airport’s use of “ad-hoc” airport stands without publishing this in the AIP. that Celebi provide corrective training to the headset operator involved in respect of their giving clearance to commence the 767 pushback without wing walkers in position.. The Final Report was released on 31 August 2018.
