On 17 July 2011, the crew of an ATR 72-200 being operated by Aer Arann on a scheduled passenger flight from Manchester to Shannon mishandled a daylight landing on 3199 metre long runway 24 at destination in normal visibility but gusty crosswind conditions and the nose landing gear collapsed. A MAYDAY was declared as directional control was lost and the aircraft gradually veered left, exiting the runway paved surface onto the grass before coming to a stop at the left edge of Taxiway Alpha. The 25 occupants were uninjured and an emergency evacuation was not necessary but the damage was such that the aircraft was declared to be beyond economic repair.
