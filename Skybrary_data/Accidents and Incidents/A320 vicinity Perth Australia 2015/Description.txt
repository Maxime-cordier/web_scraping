On 12 September 2015, an Airbus A320 (VH-FNP) being operated by Virgin Australia Regional Airlines on a domestic passenger charter flight from Perth to Boolgeeda, Western Australia experienced uncommanded autopilot and autothrust disconnection and multiple system alerts as the aircraft climbed on departure from Perth in day IMC. During the subsequent return to Perth, a precautionary PAN was declared to ATC and a stall warning which occurred whilst establishing on the ILS localiser was disregarded without apparent consequence but subsequently was found to have been real.
