On 22 August 2019, a Boeing 737-800 (JA322J) being operated by Japan Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from New Chitose to Fukuoka as JL3512 stopped whilst taxiing for departure in daylight after encountering a sudden loss of visibility in unforecast heavy snow. After further taxiing and another stop, a cabin crew report of fumes and unusual smells in the cabin and flames coming from the right engine, it was decided to shut down and order an emergency evacuation of all 165 occupants. This was accomplished with one serious passenger injury and two minor ones.
