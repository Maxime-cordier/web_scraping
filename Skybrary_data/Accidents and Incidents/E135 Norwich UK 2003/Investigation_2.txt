of contaminant and braking action in order to calculate a crosswind limit, this was not the case with this company” and that, had the crew wished to check their landing crosswind limitation, they would have needed a braking action report from ATC, which would not have been forthcoming. The Investigation concluded that the flight crew “appeared unaware of how critical the LDA at Norwich Airport was for their approach in the prevailing conditions. Their arrival brief was based on ATIS information that was benign compared to the conditions actually encountered. Had the crew consulted any of the tables in the (Route Planning Manual) at this point however, they would have realised that minor changes in the landing conditions or a less than accurate approach and touchdown would have resulted in a critical situation. A more thorough brief may have enabled them to identify exactly what weather changes would require a diversion, eliminating the need to consult RPM tables during the high workload period of the approach.” Two Safety Recommendations were made: That the CAA encourage research that could lead to the production of equipment that can accurately measure the braking action of runways under all conditions of surface contamination. (2003-96). That City Airline review its Embraer 135 landing configuration policy and, in consultation with Embraer Brasileira de Aeronautica SA, produce a comprehensive written procedure that includes advice and highlights the ramifications associated with the execution of a 'Flap 22' landing. (2003-97). The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 6 November 2003 and may be seen in full at SKYbrary bookshelf: AAIB Bulletin No: 11/2003 Ref: EW/C2003/01/05
