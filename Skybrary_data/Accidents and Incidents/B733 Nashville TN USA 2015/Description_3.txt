found that prior to the accident, the controller in charge (CIC) had "inadvertently" turned off the taxiway J & Apron 2 lighting whilst intending to routinely switch off the centreline lights. Airport Operations staff notified the CIC that the lights were off and "he turned them back on approximately 25 minutes after the accident had occurred". The Investigation determined that the Probable Cause of the accident was "the flight crew's early turn towards the assigned gate because taxiway lighting had been inadvertently turned off by the controller-in-charge which resulted in the airplane leaving the paved surface‚Äù. A Contributory Factor to the accident was determined as "the operation of the screen-saver function on the lighting control panel that prevented the tower controllers from having an immediate visual reference to the status of the airfield lighting". In regards to Safety Action, it was noted that after the accident, Nashville TWR ATC had "modified their standard operating procedure regarding responsibility for taxiway lighting and eliminated the lighting panel screensaver function". The Final Report was adopted by the NTSB on 23 January 2017. No Safety Recommendations were made.
