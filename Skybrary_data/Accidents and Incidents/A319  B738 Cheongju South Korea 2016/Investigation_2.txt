contacted TWR to obtain permission to issue a landing clearance which was received and issued with caution that the RVR had just dropped marginally below the 550 metre Cat 1 minimum. The 737 crew replied that they had the runway in sight. Ten seconds later, the A319 called GND ready for taxi and received the immediate response “runway in use 24R, taxi via B3 is approved, altimeter 29.87”. The A319 replied with “runway 24R via taxiway B3” and began to taxi. The METAR current at the time gave the wind calm, visibility 3,200 metres in mist but with some cloud/fog patches present and identical Air and Dew Point Temperatures. Within the previous five minutes, the 24R touchdown RVR had dropped from 1500 metres to 450 metres. After 90 seconds taxiing, and without any further communication with ATC, the A319, now with much reduced forward visibility, crossed the runway 24R holding point unseen by either controller, entered the runway and after a further 16 seconds started a left turn to backtrack along the runway. Three seconds earlier, the 737 had touched down within the TDZ at a position approximately 600 metres past the runway threshold with the (as yet unseen) A319 less than 600 metres ahead. Nine seconds after touching down and with groundspeed reducing though 100 knots, the 737 crew saw the other aircraft at the same time as it saw the 737 and stopped. The 737 crew immediately used a left rudder input and left differential braking to deviate left of the runway centreline by what was subsequently calculated to have been six metres, enough to pass 3 metres clear of the A319 (see the illustration below). The position of the two aircraft as they passed annotated with relevant distances/ dimensions. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The 737 completed its landing roll and then backtracked to exit the runway via the B3 taxiway. In the meantime, the A319 had been cleared to backtrack and line up at the threshold. However by the time it reached this position, the RVR had dropped below the minimum required for takeoff so once the 737 was clear, it was cleared to taxi to the 06L threshold where with the visibility 2,500 metres it was cleared for takeoff and departed without further event 36 minutes after the near miss. It was found that just one second before minimum separation between the two aircraft occurred, the GND controller, without either controller realising that the A319 was on the runway, had instructed it to change to TWR. Neither aircraft was aware of the presence of the other until the very late acquisition of visual contact in the prevailing fog affecting the north eastern half of the runway because the departing A319 was still on the GND frequency and the landing 737 was on the TWR frequency. FDR data confirmed that when the 737 crew saw the other aircraft they responded by making an immediate rudder and brake input to achieve a deviation to the left of
