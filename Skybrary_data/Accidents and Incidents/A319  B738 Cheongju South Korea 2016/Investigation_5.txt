a lack of understanding” of procedure so that more pilot training was necessary if repetition of such errors was to be avoided. The Probable Cause of the Serious Incident was formally documented as “the China Southern Airlines Airbus A319 was permitted to taxi up to the runway 24R stop line on taxiway B3 by the Ground Controller at the Cheongju Control Tower but misunderstood this as a taxi clearance to enter the runway and backtrack (no parallel taxiway) to line up for takeoff on 24R and crossed the hold short line onto runway 24R on which the Korean Airlines Boeing 737 was landing”. Two Contributory Factors were also identified as: The Ground Controller failed to stop the A319 before it entered the runway due to negligent visual monitoring.. The Ground Controller did not clearly specify the clearance limit as the holding point for runway 24R (training on terminology was insufficient).. Four Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Findings of the Investigation as follows: that China Southern Airlines instructs its flight crew in respect of the runway entry stop line and runway entry procedures, air traffic control procedure training and reinforcement of local airport training. [AIR1603-1]. that the Korean Air Force (Cheongju TWR) prepare an improvement plan for visual surveillance procedure of aircraft entry to a runway for use by Ground and Runway controllers throughout Korea. [AIR1603-2]. that the Korean Air Force (Cheongju TWR) prepare measures to prevent taxiing aircraft from entering the runway in use by improving Ground Control procedures and Ground Control instruction terminology. [AIR1603-3]. that the Korea Airports Corporation, considering the reality of Cheongju Airport where fog often occurs, should prepare a plan to install buried runway warning lights on the runway entry stop lines on taxiways A3 and B3. [AIR1603-4]. The Final Report was released in the Korean language only on 27 March 2018.
