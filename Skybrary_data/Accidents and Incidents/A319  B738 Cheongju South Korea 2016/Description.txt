On 18 March 2016 an Airbus A319 (B6039) being operated by China Southern Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Cheongju to Dalian as CZ8444 continued beyond its departure clearance limit at the mid-runway holding point for 24R at night with thick fog present and began to enter the runway for backtrack just as a Boeing 737-800 (HL7786) touched down on the same runway. On sighting the A319 which had just stopped, the 737 crew made an instant turn to the left whilst still at high speed and just avoided a collision before completing their landing roll.
