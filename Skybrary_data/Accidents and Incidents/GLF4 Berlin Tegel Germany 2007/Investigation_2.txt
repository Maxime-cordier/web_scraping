been switched off at the time of the incident. The Investigation was advised that “more than 80% of all aircraft movements at Tegel occur between the southern apron and the runways. It was found that prevailing ATC procedures required that controllers should use the SMR for the monitoring and controlling of aircraft and vehicles on the manoeuvring area “by night” regardless of surface visibility It was noted that from the perspective of the Gulfstream crew, they had no reason to doubt that ATC understood the location of their aircraft once they had been working GND and so it was reasonable to initially assume that TWR also knew where they were. In the end, it was considered that “only the fact that the crew doubted the instruction (to proceed) several times, and…insisted on an explicit clearance to cross runway 26R” had disabused her erroneous assumptions.
