On 12 January 2007, a Gulfstream G-IV being operated by the Swedish Air Force and about to depart with passengers for Bremen was cleared to cross an active landing runway at Berlin Tegel in normal night visibility when traffic had already been cleared to land on it after both the GND and TWR controllers had failed to establish where the aircraft had been parked and was thereafter located. The flight crew recognised that it would be inappropriate to proceed and stopped their aircraft.
