On 14 November 2019, a Boeing 737-800 (7T-VKR) being operated by Air Algérie on a scheduled international passenger flight from Lyon Saint-Exupéry to Annaba Algeria as AH1157 had commenced a night takeoff in normal ground visibility with LVP in force when the controller saw snow clearance vehicles entering the runway ahead and instructed the aircraft to reject its takeoff which it did. The vehicle had been cleared to enter the runway by the GND controller without prior coordination with the TWR controller.
