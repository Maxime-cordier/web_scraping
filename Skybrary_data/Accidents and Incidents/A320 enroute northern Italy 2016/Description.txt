On 15 August 2016, an Airbus A320 (HA-LPN) being operated by Wizz Air Hungary on a scheduled international passenger flight from Barcelona to Riga was in the cruise over northern Italy when the Captainâ€™s cognitive condition began to deteriorate and he assigned all flight tasks to the First Officer. When his condition deteriorated further, a company First Officer travelling as one of the 182 passengers was invited to occupy the flight deck supernumerary crew to assist and this pilot subsequently swapped seats with the Captain for the remainder of the flight which was completed without further event.
