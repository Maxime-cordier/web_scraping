On 21 February 2017, an Airbus A320 (EC-HTD) being operated by Vueling on a domestic passenger flight from Malaga to Barcelona as VLG2116 with the APU inoperative experienced successive failures of both air conditioning and pressurisation systems, the second of which occurred at FL300 and prompted the declaration of MAYDAY and an emergency descent followed by an uneventful diversion to Alicante during which one of the inoperative systems was successfully reinstated.
