On 10 June 1990, a BAC 1-11 operated by British Airways, during climb, experienced sudden explosive depressurisation which resulted in loss of the left hand windscreen. The Captain was partially sucked into the windscreen aperture but was then successfully restrained by members of the cabin crew, while the First Officer took control and completed the flight without further event.
