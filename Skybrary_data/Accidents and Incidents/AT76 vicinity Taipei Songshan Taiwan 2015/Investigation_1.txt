An Investigation was carried out by the Taiwan Aviation Safety Council (ASC). Both the FDR and 2 hour CVR were recovered and data from both of them were successfully downloaded. The PCMCIA Card from the QAR was also recovered undamaged and found to contain almost equivalent data to that on the FDR. Recorded ATC data were also available. It was found that three pilots were on the flight deck, two qualified as Captain on type as the operating crew and a 63 year-old ATR72-500 First Officer, who was undergoing differences training for the ATR72-600, was occupying the supernumerary crew seat as an Observer. Captain 'A' was 42 years old and was occupying the left hand seat as commander. He was a former Air Force pilot who on retirement had joined another airline and undertook training to become an Airbus A330 First Officer but failed to qualify. He had then joined TransAsia where he had qualified as an ATR72-500 First Officer in 2011 and had been promoted to Captain in August 2014. In November 2014, he had completed differences training for the ATR72-600 and transferred to that fleet as a Captain. He had accumulated 4,914 total flying hours which included 3,151 hours on the ATR72-500 and approximately 250 hours on the ATR72-600. Captain 'B' was 45 years old and had joined TransAsia in June 2006 and completed training as a First Officer with the Company on the ATR72-500 in August 2007. Four years later he had been promoted to Captain and then in February 2014, he had completed differences training and transferred to the ATR72-600 fleet as Captain. He had accumulated 6,822 total flying hours which included 5,687 hours on the ATR72-500 and 795 hours on the ATR72-600. The flight was the third of four sectors for the flight crew consisting of two return flights from Songshan to Kinmen. Take-off from runway 10 was commenced with Captain 'A' as PF, Four seconds later, the PM stated that the Automatic Take-off Power Control System (ATPCS) was not armed. The PF responded that the take-off would continue which was acknowledged by the PM. After a further seven seconds, the PM advised that the ATPCS was now indicating 'armed' and the aircraft became airborne 11 seconds after that. The AP was engaged soon afterwards in LNAV and, at 115 knots, IAS modes. TWR instructed the aircraft to change to Taipei APP as it commenced a climbing right turn passing 1000 feet in accordance with the assigned SID. Then, as it passed 1200 feet, the FDR recording indicated that the left engine was operating in an uptrim condition with its bleed valve closed which "corresponded with the beginning of an ATPCS sequence" in which the right engine had been auto feathered. The Master Warning was annunciated accompanied by an "ENG 2 FLAME OUT AT TAKE OFF" message in the Engine Warning Display. The AP was disconnected almost immediately and the PF announced that he would "pull back engine one throttle”. The PM responded with “wait
