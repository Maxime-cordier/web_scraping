snow and sleet settled on the tailplane's leading edge and underside during taxi and takeoff. This contamination is presumed to have frozen to ice. The aircraft's anti and de-icing systems on the wings and tailplane were switched on, but the tailplane de-icing system had completed a complete ‘cycle’ before takeoff and was in rest mode during takeoff. The Investigation considers that the aircraft's anti- and de-icing systems were not suitable for removing the type of ice and snow that had most likely settled on the aircraft tailplane. The aircraft should have been de-iced before take-off, in line with the operator's de-icing procedure. This accident shows the significance of good crew resource management (CRM) in the flight deck when an unexpected and extreme flight situation occurs. In this instance, the First Officer's situational awareness and initial pull-out contributed to the aircraft not crashing. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Textron/Cessna inform all its customers that operate Cessna Citations about this accident and about the risk of contamination on the tailplane in the form of ice or other substances which can result in the tailplane stalling. SL no. 2020/01T. that the Civil Aviation Authority Norway changes its routines for approving organisations in line with the intent of the EASA regulation. SL no. 2020/02T. The Final Report was published on 30 January 2020.
