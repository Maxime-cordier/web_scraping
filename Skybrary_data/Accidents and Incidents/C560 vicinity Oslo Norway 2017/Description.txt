On 11 January 2017, a Cessna Citation 560 (LN-IDB) being operated by air taxi company Hesnes Air on a non revenue positioning flight from Oslo to the company base at Sandefjord/Torp as HSG03 experienced an uncommanded sudden and violent nose-down manoeuvre in day IMC. A MAYDAY was declared as recovery was achieved with minimal terrain clearance but it was cancelled after full control was regained and the intended flight was completed without further event. Structural damage to the aircraft was subsequently found to be so severe that it was declared a hull loss.
