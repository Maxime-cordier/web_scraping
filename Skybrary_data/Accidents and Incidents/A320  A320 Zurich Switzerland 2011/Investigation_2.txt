Avoidance Sub-system (RIMCAS) but that when the alarm was activated as the two aircraft approached the intersection at speeds of 143 knots (the 16 aircraft) and 100 knots (the 28 aircraft) it had been activated “too late” to render any useful collision prevention function. It was, however, noted by the Investigation that the purpose of RIMCAS as installed at the time of the incident was primarily to provide warnings of potential collisions between vehicles and aircraft and was unsuited to resolving a conflict between two aircraft at high speed. The fact that neither of the two aircraft involved had heard the take off clearance given to the other aircraft even though they were both being controlled on the same frequency was considered to be easily understood by recognising that both aircraft crews had been in a phase of high concentration approaching the point of their imminent take off and then commencing it in which “perception is focused on (ones) own call sign and a message with a different call sign can be blanked out”. The Captain of the aircraft departing runway 28 stated that immediately before his aircraft had reached V1, he had caught sight of the other aircraft coming from the right on runway 16 and seen that it was already lifting off. He had begun to reject his take off immediately and he advised that neither he nor his First Officer had heard the subsequent call from ATC ordering a rejected take off. The Investigation considered that this was unsurprising given that the crew were already suddenly involved in the highly focused task of the reject from a very high speed and in any case, the engine noise at this point would have been high. It was concluded that the crew of the aircraft rejecting take off “had acted responsively and efficiently and carefully implemented the procedures laid down for such a case”. The occurrence of previous similar Serious Incidents at Zurich which had been subject to Investigation was reviewed and it was found that since the year 2000, there had been a total of 12 comparable events on or in the immediate vicinity of the airport, in relation to which a total 19 Safety Recommendations had been issued. The Investigation reviewed these and the response by the ANSP to recommendations made and came to the conclusion that the circumstances of the incident under current investigation in the context of the previous history created the impression that “the previously implemented improvement in the operation of Zurich airport has been able to eliminate only selective risks” and that “the constant emergence of new problems suggests that the entire system of Zurich airport is currently being operated in a manner which involves further risks inherent in the system”. The Investigation formally identified the Cause of the Serious Incident as: “the fact that the air traffic control officer concerned gave take-off clearance to an aircraft on runway 28 although another aircraft on runway 16, to which he had given take-off clearance
