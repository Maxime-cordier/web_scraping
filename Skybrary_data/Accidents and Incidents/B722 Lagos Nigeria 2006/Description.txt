On 7 September 2006, a Boeing 727-200 being operated by DHL on a scheduled cargo flight from Accra to Lagos landed long at destination on 2745 metre long runway 18L off a day Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach in reduced but not low ground visibility in rain. Deceleration was poor and the aircraft overran the end of the runway at speed onto flat but soft ground before eventually coming to a stop. There was some damage to both aircraft and ground installations but no significant impact occurred.
