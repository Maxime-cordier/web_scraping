On 15 November 2018, the nose landing gear of a Bombardier DHC8-300 (C-FPAE) being operated by PAL Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Churchill Falls to Deer Lake as PVL1922 did not lock down when selected normally and after alternative methods were also unsuccessful, diverted to Stephenville having declared an emergency on the basis that it had a more suitable runway and better weather. The landing there after an approach in day VMC was on the main gear only, but by the time the aircraft nose made contact with the runway, the speed was low so only minor consequential damage was caused and no injuries were sustained by the 51 occupants.
