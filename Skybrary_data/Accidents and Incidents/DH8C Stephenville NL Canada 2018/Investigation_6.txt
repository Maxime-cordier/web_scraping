risk that operators will not identify unserviceable items or conditions.. If voice recordings and cockpit sounds are not available to an investigation, the identification and communication of safety deficiencies to advance transportation safety may be precluded.. One ‘Other Finding’ was also made: Because the nose landing gear had already moved from the uplocked position and was jammed in a partially extended position, pulling the nose gear release handle had no effect.. Safety Action taken as a result of the investigated event prior to the completion of the Investigation was noted as having included the following: Safran Landing Systems amended the Nose Landing Gear CMM to include a specific instruction to check the inner cylinder dimensions to ensure that the correct components are installed. They also issued a SIL which emphasised the importance of following all instructions provided in the CMM including those related to the methods of identifying components after repair and highlighted the CMM update requiring a check of the dimensions of the specified components before assembly to ensure that the mating parts are being correctly installed.. PAL Airlines amended the content of its company-formulated ‘Dash 8 Layover Check’ to emphasise the NLG shock strut minimum and maximum extension measurements and to require its maintenance personnel to record the observed strut extension measurement NLG after each such Check. The company also introduced a formal External Pre-Flight Checklist for its pilots.. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 3 June 2020 and it was officially released on 20 July 2020. No new Safety Recommendations were made.
