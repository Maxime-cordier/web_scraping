An Investigation was carried out by the Spanish Commission for the Investigation of Accidents and Incidents (CIAIAC). All the required information was obtained from ATC and Meteorological sources and no recorded flight data was taken from the aircraft involved. The event involved four separate losses of separation whilst runways 18L and 18R were both in use as designated landing runways (‘South Configuration’) following an earlier unscheduled change from operations with runways in ‘North configuration’ (landing on runways 32L and 32R). This change followed seven go arounds in northerly runway configuration due to unfavourable wind conditions (tailwind component and/or wind shear) in a period of 10 minutes. The aircraft involved, all operating scheduled passenger flights into Madrid, were as follows: Event 1 An Airbus A320 (CS-TNQ) being operated by TAP inbound and from Lisbon under callsign TAP1018 A Bombardier CRJ 1000 (EC-LJS) being operated by Air Nostrum for Iberia and inbound from Alicante under callsign ANE99DJ. An Airbus A320 (CS-TNQ) being operated by TAP inbound and from Lisbon under callsign TAP1018. A Bombardier CRJ 1000 (EC-LJS) being operated by Air Nostrum for Iberia and inbound from Alicante under callsign ANE99DJ. Event 2 A Boeing 737-800 (EI-FZR) being operated by Ryanair and inbound from Birmingham under callsign RYR290B A Bombardier CRJ 1000 (EC-LJR) being operated by Air Nostrum and inbound from Turin as ANE8825. A Boeing 737-800 (EI-FZR) being operated by Ryanair and inbound from Birmingham under callsign RYR290B. A Bombardier CRJ 1000 (EC-LJR) being operated by Air Nostrum and inbound from Turin as ANE8825. Event 3 An Airbus A320 (EC-LYM) being operated by Iberia Express and inbound from Birmingham as IBS36BK A Boeing 737-800 (EI-FTY) being operated by Ryanair and inbound from Dublin as RYR54AH. An Airbus A320 (EC-LYM) being operated by Iberia Express and inbound from Birmingham as IBS36BK. A Boeing 737-800 (EI-FTY) being operated by Ryanair and inbound from Dublin as RYR54AH. Event 4 A Boeing 737-800 (EC-LXV) being operated by Air Europa and inbound from Lanzarote as AEA5BN An Airbus A330-200 (EC-LVL) being operated by Air Europa and inbound from Milan Malpensa as AEA7EY. A Boeing 737-800 (EC-LXV) being operated by Air Europa and inbound from Lanzarote as AEA5BN. An Airbus A330-200 (EC-LVL) being operated by Air Europa and inbound from Milan Malpensa as AEA7EY. All the events involved a failure to ensure that the separation minima for dependent parallel ILS approaches to runways 18L and 18R were met. In the absence of 1000 feet vertical separation, these required a minimum of 3nm horizontally between two aircraft when one is turning onto each ILS LLZ. Also, once established on the ILS LLZ, each aircraft was required to be a minimum of 3 nm from any aircraft ahead on the same LLZ and 2nm away from an aircraft making an approach on the adjacent LLZ. No evidence was found that flight crew non-compliance with ATC instructions had contributed to the occurrence of any of the losses of separation. It was noted that the Madrid TAF (aerodrome forecast) current for
