On 27 May 2018, after a series of seven go-arounds in 10 minutes at Madrid due to an excessive tailwind component on the ‘preferred configuration’ parallel landing runways in use, it was decided to change runway use to one providing landing runways more suited to the prevailing wind conditions. This change was then followed by 4 losses of separation between 8 different aircraft during final approach in day VMC each involving aircraft failing to meet the prescribed minimum of 2nm radar separation when vertically separated by less than 1000 feet and on approach to dependent parallel runways. All the aircraft involved were operating scheduled passenger flights.
