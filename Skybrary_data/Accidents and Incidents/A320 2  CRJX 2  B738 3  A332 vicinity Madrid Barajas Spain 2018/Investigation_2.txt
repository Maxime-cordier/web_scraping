the time of both the go-arounds prior to runway re-configuration and the losses of separation after it, had included as a PROB40 TEMPO (temporary) of variable wind directions at 15-27 knots with visibility 4000 metres in a thunderstorm with rain showers and SCT (scattered) CB at 2,500 feet aal. The METAR current just prior to the time of the 7 go-arounds from approaches to runways 32L and 32R gave the actual wind velocity as from 300° varying 270°-330° at a mean speed of 11 knots with a thunderstorm in the vicinity. After three of these go-arounds, it was decided to immediately change runway configuration so that landings would be on runways to 18L and 18R. Between this decision being taken and the ATIS being updated to advise the change of landing runways, four more consecutive go-arounds occurred. All these go-arounds were due to one or both of excessive tailwind or wind shear. By the time a new METAR was issued just after the seventh go-around had been initiated, the surface wind was from 120° at 7 knots gusting to 16 knots. The almost 180° change in wind direction was attributed to a gust front associated with a thunderstorm to the east of the airport. Event 1 occurred just over half an hour after the runway configuration change had been made and involved the CRJ 1000 on the 18L ILS remaining less than 2nm clear of the A320 behind it on 18R ILS for the final 12 nm with separation steadily reducing to reach 0.8 nm just before touchdown.. Event 2 involved the CRJ 1000 on 18L ILS being less than 2 nm clear of the A320 behind it on the 18R ILS for the final 12 nm as it approached touchdown, with separation steadily reducing to 1.2 nm just before touchdown.. Event 3 involved the A320, already established on the ILS 18R being less than 3nm ahead of the 737-800 as it joined the 18L ILS and once it was established at around 8nm, less than 2nm in front, this separation then steadily reducing to 0.9nm just before touchdown.. Event 4 involved the 737-800 on the 18R ILS being less than 2nm behind the A330-200 on the 18L ILS from 11 nm prior to touchdown and then steadily reducing to less than 1nm shortly before touchdown.. The Investigation considered various factors which were likely to have collectively contributed to the losses of final approach separation, noting that the decision to change runway configuration without prior notice was made by the TWR Supervisor at the airport in response to the situation there without explicit regard to the ad hoc complexity which the change would create in the TMA. It was noted that the TWR Supervisor had begun considering a runway configuration change as soon as the sudden surface wind change occurred and aircraft on approach began reporting an increased tailwind component, wind shear and the presence of storm east of the airport. However, after discussing it with the ACC Supervisor, he
