On 2 September 2019, a Boeing 777-300ER (9V-SWD) being operated by Singapore Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Shanghai Pudong to Singapore Changi failed to climb as expected when the autopilot was engaged soon after takeoff in night VMC and a series of EGPWS ‘DON’T SINK’ cautions were followed by a ‘PULL UP’ activation. The autopilot was disconnected and climb restarted but when it was re-engaged, the aircraft again began to descend and it was only then realised that the FMS had been mis-programmed. Once corrective action was taken, the remainder of the flight was without further event.
