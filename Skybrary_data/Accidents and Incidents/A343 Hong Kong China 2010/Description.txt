On 27 November 2010, an Airbus A340-300B being operated by Finnair on a scheduled passenger flight from Hong Kong to Helsinki with a relief pilot occupying the supernumerary crew seat began its take off roll at night in normal visibility from a taxiway parallel to the runway from which take off clearance had been given by ATC. The ground movement controller noticed the error on his Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System screen and alerted the TWR controller who ordered the crew to stop. The aircraft came to a stop after travelling 1400 metres with no injury to the occupants or damage to the aircraft or ground facilities. After the overheated brakes had cooled, the same three man flight crew operated the aircraft to the planned destination.
