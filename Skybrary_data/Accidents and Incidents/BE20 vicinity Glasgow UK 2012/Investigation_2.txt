“content to fly an aircraft equipped with mechanical instrumentation”, he had not received any formal differences training. The Investigation examined the situation in respect of differences training for aircraft variants covered by a common type rating and found that there are no EASA requirements for differences training within the B200 type rating. It was found that UK CAA guidance extant at the time of the incident had included a generic recommendation that “pilots converting from EFIS to Mechanical Instruments for the first time” should obtain appropriate differences training - but this advice had been absent from the corresponding replacement document since issued. In the light of these findings, the Investigation considered that it was likely that the inadvertent selection had “diminished the effectiveness of the Co Pilot’s instrument scan and increased his workload” whilst “actions associated with the inadvertent and unrecognised AP disengagement had distracted both pilots from the primary flight instruments and caused a breakdown in situational awareness, such that the aircraft descended below its cleared altitude unnoticed by the crew”. The formally stated conclusion of the Investigation was that “the incident followed a loss of situational awareness by the crew, caused by a combination of distraction and an unfamiliar cockpit layout". The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 13 June 2013. No Safety Recommendations were made but Safety Action taken was noted as follows: The operator has introduced procedures to ensure that pilots who have not flown a mechanically instrumented aircraft within 90 days receive an expanded differences briefing from a training captain before flying the aircraft.. In the absence of any European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) requirements for type rating differences training for variants of the B200, the UK CAA has added general guidance on differences training for pilots converting from EFIS to mechanical instruments for the first time to its current licensing reference document..
