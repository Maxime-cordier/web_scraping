On 15 September 2012, a Beech B200 Super King Air on a medical transfer flight from Wick to Glasgow was observed by ATC to make a rapid descent below the cleared altitude of 3500 feet in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) at night after becoming established on the Instrument Landing System (ILS) LOC at destination. Recognition by the crew of the unintended descent towards terrain was followed by an Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) ‘TERRAIN TERRAIN PULL UP’ Warning and an alert from ATC who also noted a consequential Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) activation.
