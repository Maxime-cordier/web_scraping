On 2 September 1999, a United Airlines Boeing Boeing 737-300 in the cruise at FL240, experienced severe turbulence due to an encounter with the wake vortex from a preceding MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MD-11 on a similar track which had climbed through the level of the B737 with minimum lateral separation, 1.5 minutes earlier.
