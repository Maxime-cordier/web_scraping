An Investigation into the occurrence was carried out by the UK AAIB. It was found that the Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) had been incorrectly entered into the Aircraft Operator’s CTOP or ‘Computer Take Off Programme’ (which is used by the crew to calculate the correct take off speeds) instead of the takeoff weight (TOW). This error generated significantly slower takeoff speeds than were required for the actual weight of the aircraft and the crew did not recognise this upon seeing and using them prior to beginning the take off. It was found that the data entry error had the effect of reducing the V1, Vr and V2 to about 20 knots below their true values. As a result of this occurrence, the Operator introduced into their Operations Manual a more explicit procedure for cross checking of data entry prior to departure: “Both pilots should independently extract the ATOM[1] from the load sheet and perform the C-TOP calculation. PF should call out any further assumptions made e.g. surface wind, runway conditions, use of anti-ice etc." The Investigation noted that the commander reported having flown about six empty sectors in a Boeing 767 prior to this flight such that the slow takeoff speeds set did not trigger an alert to him. The UK AAIB Report was issued on 9 July 2009 and made no Safety Recommendations.
