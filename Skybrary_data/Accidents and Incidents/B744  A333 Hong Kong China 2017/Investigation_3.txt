procedures has been rewritten to better stress the importance of both compliance with SOPs and the need for heightened situational awareness when they are used.. A reminder that volume settings of the A-SMGCS must not be adjusted in a way that might adversely affect the effectiveness of its audible conflict alerts.. Runway entry point Stop Bars are now illuminated at all times rather than only at night or during low visibility conditions.. GND controllers must now ensue that electronic flight strips for aircraft which will need to cross any active runway are identified conspicuously by indenting them to provide an additional reminder and this indenting must only be removed once the aircraft concerned has completed such a crossing and been returned to the GND frequency.. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department as ANSP should continuously review the runway crossing procedures together with the effective use of stop-bar lights, conflict alert functions of ground surveillance equipment and Tower Electronic Flight Strip System to further mitigate the risk of runway incursion. [06-2021]. that Air Cargo Global should review the relevant part(s) of the Operations Manual concerning Taxiing of Aircraft and consider including a requirement for the flight crew to obtain an explicit clearance to cross any runway. [07-2021]. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed early in August 2021 and released online shortly afterwards.
