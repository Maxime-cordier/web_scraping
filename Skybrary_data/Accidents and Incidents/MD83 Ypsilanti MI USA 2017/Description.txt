On 8 March 2017, a Boeing MD83 (N786TW) being operated by Ameristar Charters on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Ypsilanti to Washington Dulles being flown by a type rated Captain undergoing supervised type-variant differences training could not be rotated during a daylight takeoff in normal visibility and the unavoidable high speed rejected takeoff led to an overrun of 350 metres. An emergency evacuation of the 116 occupants was successfully accomplished with just one passenger sustaining a minor injury but the damage to the aircraft was substantial.
