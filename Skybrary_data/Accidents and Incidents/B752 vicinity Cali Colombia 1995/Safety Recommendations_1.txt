As a result of the Investigation, the following 22 Safety Recommendations were issued: that the Federal Aviation Administration should develop and implement standards for the portrayal of terminal environment information on FMS/EFIS displays that match, as closely as possible, the portrayal of that information on approach charts.. that the Federal Aviation Administration should evaluate all FMS-equipped aircraft and, where necessary, require manufacturers to modify the FMS logic to retain those fixes between the position of an aeroplane and the one which it is proceeding towards following the execution of a command to the FMS to proceed direct to a fix other than the next in line.. that the Federal Aviation Administration should require airlines to provide pilots through CRM and flight training with the tools to recognize when the FMC becomes an obstacle to the proper conduct of the flight and correctly evaluate when to discontinue the use of the FMC and revert to basic radio navigation.. that the Federal Aviation Administration should require that all approach and navigation charts used in aviation graphically portray the presence of terrain that is located near airports, or flight paths.. that the Federal Aviation Administration should require pilots operating FMS equipped aircraft to have open and easily accessible the navigation charts applicable to each phase of flight before each phase is reached.. that the Federal Aviation Administration should encourage manufacturers to develop and validate methods to present accurate terrain information on flight displays as part of a system of earlier ground proximity warning.. that the Federal Aviation Administration should require the Jespersen-Sanderson Company to inform airlines operating FMS-equipped aircraft of the presence of each difference in the naming or portrayal of navigation information on FMS-generated and approach chart information, and require airlines to inform their pilots of these differences, as well as the logic and priorities employed in the display of electronic FMS navigation information.. that the Federal Aviation Administration should evaluate the curricula and flight check requirements used to train and certificate pilots to operate FMS equipped aeroplanes, and revise the curricula and flight check requirements to assure that pilots are fully knowledgeable in the logic underlying the FMS or similar computer system before being granted aircraft type certification... that the Federal Aviation Administration should perform en route inspections of United States-domiciled airlines operating into Latin America in compliance with standards according to the provisions of ICAO Document 8335 part 9.4 and Part 9.6.33.. that the Federal Aviation Administration should evaluate the Boeing procedure for guarding the speed brake handle during periods of deployment, and require airlines to implement the procedure if it increases the speed of stowage or decreases the likelihood of forgetting to stow the speed brakes in an emergency situation.. that the Federal Aviation Administration should evaluate the dynamic and operational effects of automatically stowing the speed brakes when high power is commanded and determine the desirability of incorporating on existing airplanes automatic speed brake retraction that would operate during wind shear and GPWS escape manoeuvres or other situations
