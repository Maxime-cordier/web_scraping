and that an interior window panel had separated. ATC was then advised that the flight would continue to destination but that a priority landing there would be needed due to passengers requiring medical attention. The Probable Cause of the event was determined as “the flight crew did not appropriately assess the weather conditions before departure from Amritsar and encountered severe turbulence during climb which resulted in passenger injuries and damage to the cabin furnishings”. One Safety Recommendation was made as follows: that Air India should re-emphasise instructions that flight crews shall use all resources to analyse the prevailing weather situation prior to flight operations in inclement weather conditions.. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed on 28 May 2019 and subsequently published.
