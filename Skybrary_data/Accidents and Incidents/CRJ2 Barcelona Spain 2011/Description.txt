On 16 July 2012, a Bombardier CRJ200 being operated by Air Nostrum on a scheduled passenger flight from Badajoz to Barcelona with the First Officer designated as PF for the sector accepted a visual approach at destination after the offer of this by ATC due to adverse weather affecting the instrument approach procedure. The visual approach subsequently became unstabilised but was continued with a high rate of descent to a landing which was sufficiently hard to be likely to have caused structural damage to the aircraft. However, the aircraft was taxied to the allocated parking stand for passenger disembarkation before any check for aircraft damage. There, it was found that the sole member of cabin crew had sustained a minor injury although all other occupants were uninjured.
