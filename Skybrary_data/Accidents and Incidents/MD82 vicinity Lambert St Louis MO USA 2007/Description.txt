On September 28, 2007 a McDonnell Douglas MD82 being operated by American Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) experienced an in flight left engine fire during departure climb from Lambert St. Louis International Airport (STL), St. Louis, Missouri. A return to land was made but when the nose landing gear failed to extend, a go around was made to allow emergency gear extension to be accomplished prior to making a second approach which culminated in a successful landing. All occupants evacuated the aircraft on the runway without injury but the aircraft sustained substantial damage due to the fire.
