An Investigation was carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB) which examined both the cause of and crew response to the engine fire. The Findings of the Investigation included that: American Airlines’ maintenance personnel’s troubleshooting efforts for the engine no-start condition incorrectly focused on the air turbine starter valve (ATSV) and engine start system wiring because of the intermittent nature of the condition, the history of ATSV electrical circuit problems, and the lack of a history of ATSV-air filter failures for which no troubleshooting guidance existed.. American Airlines’ maintenance personnel repeatedly used an unapproved maintenance procedure, which included using a prying device to push the air turbine starter valve manual override button, to manually start the accident engine, which resulted in bending the internal pin in the override button.. The internal pin in the left engine air turbine starter valve (ATSV) override button was bent, which resulted in the uncommanded opening of the ATSV during high-power engine conditions at the beginning of the takeoff roll and caused the air turbine starter to freewheel until it sustained a catastrophic internal failure.. The open air turbine starter valve and resulting failed air turbine starter allowed a hotter than typical airstream and/or incandescent particles to flow into the engine nacelle area and likely provided the ignition source for the in-flight fire.. A combustible fluid, such as oil, hydraulic fluid, or fuel, was available in the engine; however, fire damage precluded the determination of the specific source of the combustible fluid.. The pilots failed to properly allocate tasks, including checklist execution and radio communications, and they did not effectively manage their workload; this adversely affected their ability to conduct essential cockpit tasks, such as completing appropriate checklists.. No preexisting indicators in the pilots’ training or performance histories were found that could explain their poor performance during the accident flight.. American Airlines’ maintenance personnel were using maintenance procedures that were not in accordance with written manuals and guidelines, and it’s Continuing Analysis and Surveillance System program did not adequately detect and correct these performance deficiencies before they contributed to an accident..
