In the context of a survivable accident, it was noted that the dynamics of the impact sequence were such that occupants had first been thrown forward and had then experienced a significant lateral force to the left. It was considered that "current FAA dynamic seat certification requirements would likely not approximate the forces encountered in this accident" and concluded that "the mechanism which leads to the significant number of serious injuries to the high thoracic spine in this accident is poorly understood." It was also noted that although the forces experienced by the stowed evacuation slides during the impact sequence had been "far in excess of their current certification requirements", the location of cabin crew near to them and the consequences of that, which included the temporary trapping of two of them, indicated that there was a case for a regulatory review of those requirements.
