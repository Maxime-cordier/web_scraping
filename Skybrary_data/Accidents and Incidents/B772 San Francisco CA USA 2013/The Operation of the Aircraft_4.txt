that the FAA had required Boeing to include the following text in Boeing 787 Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM): "During a descent in FLCH mode or VNAV SPD mode, the A/T may activate in HOLD mode. When in HOLD mode, the A/T will not wake up even during large deviations from target speed and does not support stall protection." It was, however, noted that although the Boeing 777 A/T functions in exactly the same way as that on the 787, similar text did not appear in the FAA-approved 777 AFM. It was also considered that a context-dependent low energy alert would help pilots successfully recover from unexpected low-energy situations like the situation encountered by the accident pilots.
