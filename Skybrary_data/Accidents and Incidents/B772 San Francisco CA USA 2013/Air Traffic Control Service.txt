Whilst there was no suggestion that any action by Air Traffic Control had had any effect at all on either the approach or the accident outcome, the Investigation did review the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) installation at San Francisco. This was found to include coverage of the approach to the accident runway and this had been configured in two sectors, the first beginning at the runway threshold and extending out to 2 miles and the second from that point out to 5 miles. Recorded radar data confirmed that the system had operated as expected and no Alerts had been generated. However, whilst the reason for this in the outer sector was that the alert threshold was not breached, the Alerts which would otherwise have occurred within the final 2 miles "were suppressed because an aircraft in this area was expected to be in close proximity to terrain". No comment was made on this finding except to note that a simulation subsequently conducted had indicated that even if the MSAW configuration in use had been set so that the outer sector began at a point 1 mile from the runway threshold instead of 2 miles, there would still have been no Alert generated for the accident aircraft approach.
