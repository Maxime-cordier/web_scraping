a colleague to go and stop the PA being made by Cabin Manager and made one to do so in both Korean and English and it began, with the Cabin Manager complying. Almost all the passengers successfully self-evacuated. As the fire spread into the fuselage, Rescue and Fire Fighting Services personnel entered the aircraft and recovered five passengers who had been unable to evacuate unaided because of their injuries. One of these passengers subsequently died. Impact forces, which “far exceeded design certification limits”, resulted in the inflation of two emergency evacuation slides inside the passenger cabin causing injury to and temporarily trapping two of the cabin crew. Two of the passengers and four of the cabin crew were ejected from the aircraft during the impact sequence. The two passengers were both fatally injured as a result and the four cabin crew all sustained serious injuries. Neither of the two ejected passengers, one of whom was later run over by two RFFS vehicles, were wearing their seatbelts and the Investigation concluded that their ejection was attributed entirely to that fact and that they would otherwise have remained in the cabin and survived. The four cabin crew were all wearing their full seat harnesses but were ejected as a result of the destruction of the aft galley where they had been seated.
