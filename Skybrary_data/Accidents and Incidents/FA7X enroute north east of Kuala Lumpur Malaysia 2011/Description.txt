On 24 May 2011, the crew of a Dassault Falcon 7X (HB-JFN) being operated by Swiss-based Jet Link AG on a non-revenue positioning flight from Nuremberg, Germany to the Kuala Lumpur business airport at Subang in night VMC had to suddenly respond to a pitch trim runaway for which there was no procedural response. A short upset involving extreme pitch up and speed loss almost to the point of a stall followed before normal pitch control returned after less than 3 minutes with no recurrence thereafter. None of the three crew on board were injured and the aircraft was undamaged.
