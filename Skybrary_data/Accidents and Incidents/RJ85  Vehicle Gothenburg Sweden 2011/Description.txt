On 8 September 2011, an Avro RJ85 being operated by Brussels Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Gothenburg to Brussels with 85 occupants was taking off from runway 21 at Gothenburg in normal day visibility when a vehicle almost entered the same runway near to the airborne point. The vehicle stopped immediately upon seeing the aircraft and the aircraft crew reported having been unaware of it.
