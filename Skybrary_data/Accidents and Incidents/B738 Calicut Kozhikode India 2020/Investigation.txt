An Investigation was carried out by the Indian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) The DFDR and two-hour CVR were recovered from the wreckage and all the data from both was successfully downloaded. Recorded ATC data and airport CCTV footage was also available. The 59 year-old Captain, who was acting as PF for the flight, had a total of 10,848 flying hours of which 4,612 hours had been on type most of it in command. He was an ex military pilot who had joined Air India as an Airbus A310 Co-Pilot in 1994. Between 2010 and 2012, still with Air India, he was type rated as a Co-Pilot (P2) on the Boeing 737-800 and the Boeing 777-200 and 300 but in 2013, he failed an attempted upgrade to a Boeing 777 command (P1) rating “despite undergoing corrective training” and as a result requested and was granted a transfer to the operator’s wholly-owned subsidiary Air India Express. In 2014, this new employer then, after conducting an “extended refresher course” sought and obtained a “revival” of the Captain’s lapsed 737-800 P2 type rating and he commenced command training on the type. Although his progress was initially “unsatisfactory”, he eventually completed all the required training to the required standard and was granted a command (P1) type rating in January 2015. With effect from November 2017, he was promoted to Line Training Captain. Since then, although based in Mumbai, he had been regularly operating from Calicut and in the 12 months prior to the accident he had operated 36 flights from and back to it. It was noted that in 2016, he had been declared temporarily unfit to fly for three months because of Diabetes Mellitus after which he was declared fit for flying in command with any “Qualified Experienced Pilot” and advised to take a monthly blood sugar test and a three monthly HbA1C test before being declared fit to fly in command without any limitations on 10 January, 2017 subject to a recommendation that all future medical renewals should take place at a specific principal examination facility and include an opinion from an endocrinologist. This recommendation continued until the accident except for his most recent medical renewal for which exemptions from these requirements were granted by the DGCA due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. He had been advised on 1 August of his rostering for the Calicut-Dubai-Calicut trip which ended in the accident and had been positioned to hotel accommodation in Calicut the previous day. The 32 year-old First Officer had a total of 1,989 flying hours of which all but 266 hours were on type. He held a CPL and had joined Air India Express on 1 December 2017, shortly after obtaining his Instrument Rating and a P2 type rating on the Boeing 737-800. He was based at Calicut and prior to the accident duty had last operated six days earlier.
