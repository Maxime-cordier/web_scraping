ensure that all doctors working at Airport Terminal Clinics must undergo formal and structured familiarisation training for their roles and responsibilities during an aircraft accident as per the published AEP. Such doctors must also participate in periodic refresher training and take part in practice emergency response drills carried out at airports for ARFF personnel training purposes as well as training them in respect of the prioritisation of mass casualty triage and casualty movement procedures.. that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) should, since Calicut is one of the ten busiest airports in India, has hilly terrain and experiences extended adverse weather conditions, install Approach Radar there for better guidance to aircraft.. that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) should, given that in November 2019, a DGCA inspection made a number of observations regarding deficiencies in conduct of Practice Emergency Exercises and that these deficiencies still existed on the day of accident, ensure that timely follow up action on all these deficiencies now occurs in order to achieve the desired training outcomes from such Exercises.. that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) should, given that the requirement for video recording of rescue operations is laid down in Air Safety Circular 2013/04, ensure that all Crash Fire Tenders and Command Posts are fitted with cameras for real time video recording of an entire rescue operation and the requirement for video recording of rescue operations should be incorporated in all Aerodrome Emergency Plans.. that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) should, given that CCTV footage can provide important leads into various aspects of an Accident Investigation, ensure that guidelines contained in Air Safety Circular 2014/05 are promulgated as a Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR) to achieve better compliance and the same should also be incorporated in the organisation manuals of aerodromes.. that the Indian Meteorological Department should, given that the role and responsibilities of Tower Meteorological Officer (TMO) during adverse weather are clearly defined in the Civil Aviation Meteorological Circular dated 01 November 2018, ensure that they and the Duty Air Traffic Control Officer are present in the Tower during dynamic weather situations.. that the Indian Meteorological Department should, since the accuracy of reported surface winds for runway 10 was affected by both non-standard installation and poor maintenance, ensure that the sensors for measuring runway 10 surface winds are installed as per the applicable regulatory specifications and that regular maintenance is undertaken.. that the Indian Meteorological Department should, since most of the day and night visibility markers included on the Calicut airport chart were not distinctly noticeable, ensure that this chart is updated in accordance with currently existing landmarks.. that the Indian Meteorological Department should, since under the terms of DGCA letter No. 20025/13/06 AL dated 08 August 2018, the AAI was permitted to recommence wide body operations at Calicut following the installation of transmissometers for RVR reporting but that at the time of the accident such instrumentation had not been installed but can significantly enhance the accuracy of visibility reporting leading to a
