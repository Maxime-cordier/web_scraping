On 5 October 2016, an Embraer 195 being operated by Air Dolomiti on a Lufthansa flight from Brussels to Munich as DLH4TX took off in normal night visibility from runway 07R at Brussels as an Airbus A320 being operated by Aer Lingus on a flight from Dublin to Brussels as EIN638 was about to land on intersecting runway 01. The A320 initiated a go around in response to an ATC instruction shortly before touch down. The A320 passed over the intersection of the two runways after the E195 had passed it on its take-off roll.
