is given or if they are instructed to hold position when reporting "ready for departure" at 07R positions H, 1 or 2.. Four Safety Recommendations were made as follows: that Air Dolomiti should revise the text in its Operations Manual Part A paragraph 8.3.1.2 to add the text "Take-off clearance must be heard by each crew member and confirmed between the crew members. If confirmation is not achieved, clarification must be requested from ATC". [BE 2016-0018]. that Belgocontrol should undertake a substantiated study on a procedure which defines a minimum elapsed time (in terms of distance to the RWY01 threshold of landing traffic) after which the instruction to “line-up and wait” (on runway 07R) via C6 should not be given. This study should also take into account the possible replacement of taxiway C6 by a right-angled entrance taxiway and the replacement of the current stop bar by a CAT I stop bar (90 m from runway centreline) as both these both factors would definitely reduce the time needed to line-up on runway 07R. [BE-2016-0019]. that the Brussels Airport Company should perform a study aimed at improving the indications of both the presence and the status of Runway 01-19 in the vicinity of its intersection with Runway 07R. [BE-2016-0020]. that the Brussels Airport Company should carry out a study into how to reduce the complexity of the taxi route to the current line-up position 2 (on runway 07R). [BE-2016-0022]. The Final Report of the Investigation was issued on 27 March 2017.
