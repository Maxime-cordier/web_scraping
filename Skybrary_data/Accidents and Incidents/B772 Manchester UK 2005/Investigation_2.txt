occurred on the second landing after the wheel had been fitted to the aircraft, when the brake pack temperature was likely to have been higher than on the previous landing.‚Äù Four Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the analysis during the Investigation of the RFFS response and the evacuation which occurred: The Civil Aviation Authority should require at aerodromes, where the Rescue and Fire Fighting Category is 3 and above, or where an air traffic control service is provided, that a radio frequency to facilitate direct communications between an aircraft and the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting Service, in the event of an accident or incident to an aircraft on the airfield, is made available and appropriately promulgated. (2005-092). The Civil Aviation Authority should require that any radio communication frequency used to facilitate direct communications between an aircraft and the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting Service, in the event of an accident or incident on the airfield, should be recorded, in order that it may be reproduced to assist in accident and incident investigation. (2005-093). It is recommended that Pakistan International Airline Corporation review the training given to their cabin crews with the intention of ensuring that, in the event of an evacuation command being given by the aircraft commander, the evacuation is carried out as expeditiously as possible, irrespective of the lack of any threat to the aircraft perceived by the cabin crew. (2005-097). It is recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority review the advice given in CAP 168 (9th edition) in regard to aerodrome procedures for leading passengers, evacuated from an aircraft, to secure areas away from the scene of the incident and ensure that the relevant Aerodrome\Emergency orders suitably address this topic.
