[A98-06]. At the conclusion of the Investigation, the TSB issued one further Recommendation: that Transport Canada, the United States Federal Aviation Administration, and Fairchild explore options for SA226 and SA227 aircraft to be equipped with a brake pressure warning indicator for each main wheel brake system.
