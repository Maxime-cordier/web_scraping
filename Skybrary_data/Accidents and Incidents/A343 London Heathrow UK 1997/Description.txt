The following extract is from the official UK AAIB Report on the Accident: The accident occurred when the aircraft, which had a landing gear problem on its final approach to Heathrow Airport, carried out an emergency landing on Runway 27L with the left main landing gear only partially extended, with the Airport Emergency Services in full and effective attendance. The evacuation was completed with minor injuries to 5 passengers and 2 crew members.

The associated torque rod pin was subsequently found beyond the end of Runway 24L at Los Angeles International Airport [â€¦]
