The following recommendations were made as a result of the investigation: Airbus Industrie should consider providing a revision to the QRH [Quick Reference Handbook] “Landing with abnormal Landing Gear” procedure to include reference to the considerations of crosswind and choice of landing runway.. The CAA, FAA and JAA should review the requirements for public transport aircraft cabin door simulators used for crew training to require that they accurately simulate any non-linear characteristics of the associated aircraft doors and to require that full instruction is given to cabin crews regarding the door operating characteristics to be expected when operating the doors in an emergency.. The CAA, FAA and JAA in consultation should amend the aircraft wheel brake certification structural torque test requirements in (TSO) C26c, paragraph 4.2(b), to require the use of representative wheel axles or other means to reproduce the expected axle deflections and associated brake assembly loads arising in service, and a post-certification torque test strip examination of such assemblies to check for yielding deformation to verify loading behaviour.. The CAA, FAA and the JAA in consultation should amend the requirements for the integration of the Failure Mode Analysis (FMA) of new design wheel brake assemblies by the aircraft manufacturer to make into account the potential secondary effects of torque rod disconnection upon landing gear operation, in order to assess the related risk of gear jamming due to torque rod fouling on adjacent parts. Where a potential for suhtorque rod fouling is identified, appropriate design action should be required to eliminate this possibility so that landing gear operation is protected.. In order that the maximum air safety benefit may be obtained from Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVRs) during incident and accident situations where associated aircraft electrical power supplies may be prematurely lost, the FAA and the CAA should commission a study to investigate the feasibility of fitting limited duration independent power supplies to solid state CVRs.. The JAA should extend the existing JAA-Ops 1.700 requirement, for aircraft above 5,700 kg and certificated after April 1998 to have 2 hour duration CVR recording capability, to include a requirement to retrofit the same weight category of aircraft certificated on, or before, April 1998 with similar recording duration CVRs.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 29 June 2000.
