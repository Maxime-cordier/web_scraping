On 29 November 2018, a Let 410 (OK-LAZ) being operated by Van Air Europe on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Split to Dubrovnik for Trade Air as TDR821 made an uneventful day VMC approach to runway 12 at destination but then landed within the confines of an unmarked and notified closed part of the runway. After coming to a stop without encountering obstructions, the aircraft was instructed to await guidance before attempting to taxi due to obstructions ahead and complied. There were no injuries to the 10 occupants and no damage was caused to the aircraft.
