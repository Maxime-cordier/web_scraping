On 13 August 2016, an Airbus A320 (EP-TTA) being operated by Atrak Airlines on a domestic passenger flight from Tehran Mehrabad to Hasheminejad as ATR 1943 failed to proceed aligned with the centreline of the 4,030 metre-long, 60 metre-wide runway 29 as it accelerated for takeoff and had departed the left side of the runway at low speed in night VMC and become immobilised in soft ground. The aircraft sustained only relatively minor damage despite an application of forward thrust after the aircraft had come to a stop which failed to move it. The 154 passengers were disembarked from the aircraft and returned to the terminal.
