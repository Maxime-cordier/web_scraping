The Findings of the Investigation included the following: The crew conducted an approach and landing in the midst of a severe and rapidly changing thunderstorm. There were no procedures within Air France related to distance required from thunderstorms during approaches and landing, nor were these required by regulations.. The touchdown was long because the aircraft floated due to its excess speed over the threshold and because the intense rain and lightning made visual contact with the runway very difficult.. Although the area up to 150 m beyond the end of Runway 24L was compliant with the (applicable State Guidance Material, Transport Canadaâ€™s) Aerodrome Standards and Recommended Practices (TP 312E), the topography of the terrain beyond this point, along the extended runway centreline, contributed to aircraft damage and to the injuries to crew and passengers.. A number of Safety Actions were taken by Air France, Transport Canada and Airbus in response to the findings of the Investigation.
