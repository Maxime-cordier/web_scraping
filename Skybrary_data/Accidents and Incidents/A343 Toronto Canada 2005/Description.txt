On 2 August 2005, an Airbus A340-300 being operated by Air France on a scheduled passenger flight from Paris CDG to Toronto landed at destination in daylight during a thunderstorm and failed to stop before reaching the end of the runway. It exited the airport perimeter and crossed a main road before ending up in a ravine approximately 300 m beyond the end of the runway. Although an intense post-crash fire began immediately and smoke began to enter the cabin, all 309 occupants were able to evacuate before the fire took significant hold. The fire eventually consumed most of the upper fuselage, the adjacent wing sections and the vertical stabilizer.
