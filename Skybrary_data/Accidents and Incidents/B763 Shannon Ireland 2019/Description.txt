On 15 August 2019, a Boeing 767-300 (N378AX) being operated by Omni Air International with an augmented flight crew on an international passenger transport flight carrying US military personnel from the USA to Kuwait via Shannon was accelerating for takeoff from runway 24 in normal night visibility when an unusual noise was heard and the Captain decided to reject the takeoff at high speed. The reject was uneventful but almost half an hour later whilst the aircraft was taxiing from its initial post-reject holding position via the runway to return to the gate for inspections, fire broke out in the left main gear bay. A precautionary emergency evacuation was carried out and the AFRS attended and extinguished the fire. One of the 143 passengers sustained a minor injury and the two forward wheels of the left main gear bogie and their associated brake units and tyre sustained substantial damage.
