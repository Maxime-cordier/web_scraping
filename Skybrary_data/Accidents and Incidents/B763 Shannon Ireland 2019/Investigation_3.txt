noted that FAA 14 CFR 25.109 states that “a satisfactory after-stop condition is defined as one in which fires are confined to tyres, wheels and brakes, such that progressive engulfment of the rest of the aircraft would not occur during the time of passenger and crew evacuation (and that) the application of firefighting means or artificial coolants should not be required for a period of 5 minutes following the stop”. The documented Findings of the Investigation included, but were not limited to the following: The flight crew significantly underestimated the maximum speed achieved during the rejected takeoff.. The post reject taxiing undertaken in three separate moves during the calculated brake cooling period involved several left turns and use of the aircraft brakes.. Boeing analysed relevant FDR data and concluded that the performance of the wheel and brake assemblies had been as expected for the aircraft weight and reject speed.. Disassembly and inspection of the damaged wheels and brakes by their manufacturer did not identify a source of the fire.. The Probable Cause of the Serious Incident was determined as “fire in the brake assembly during taxi following a high-speed rejected take-off which occurred 28 minutes earlier”. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 22 November 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
