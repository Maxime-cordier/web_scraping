being flown was attributable in part to their “high workload following the initiation of the go around and the change of control (which) led their focus to be inside the aircraft for a significant period”. It was also considered that the fact that “the commander was in a relatively unfamiliar role and being assessed on his performance (meant that) it is likely that he did not wish to be too overbearing on the First Officer and so allowed the perceived excess energy situation to persist longer than he would in normal circumstances”. The Conclusion of the Investigation was formally documented as follows: The go-around and the very high resultant workload, followed by a change of PF, led to a situation where the ability of one of the A320 crew to react to ATC instructions was reduced. Due to the delay in the response by the A320 crew there was a short term loss of separation between the aircraft. The Saab 340 crew received a TCAS RA which prevented a further degradation of separation. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 14 November 2019. No Safety Recommendations were made.
