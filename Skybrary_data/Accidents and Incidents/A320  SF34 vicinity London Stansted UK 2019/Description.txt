On 12 February 2019, an Airbus A320 (OE-IHD) being operated by Laudamotion on a scheduled international passenger flight from Vienna to London Stansted as LDM9421 and which had just commenced a pilot-initiated go around from runway 23 at destination lost separation in night VMC against a Saab 340B (G-LGNK), being operated by Loganair as LOG65KL which was on a domestic passenger flight from London Stansted to Dundee, as it crossed above this aircraft. ATC took the Saab 340, which had just taken off from the same runway and was climbing on runway heading, off the SID being flown to ensure separation but a TCAS RA was briefly activated and followed as the A320 passed over the Saab with approximately 600 feet vertical separation.
