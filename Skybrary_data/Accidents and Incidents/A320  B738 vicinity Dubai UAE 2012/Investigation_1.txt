An Investigation was carried out by the UAE GCAA Air Accident Investigation Sector (AAIS). Data recorded on the FDRs of both aircraft was successfully downloaded and ATC radar and voice recordings were available. It was established that the A320 had taken off from runway 30 at Sharjah at approximately 2058LT and, two minutes later, the 737 had departed from runway 30R at Dubai. On checking in with Dubai DEP soon after take-off, the A320 was instructed to continue straight ahead and cleared to climb to 5,000 feet. Subsequently, further instructions were issued, including a left turn onto a heading of 210º "for sequencing" and then at 21:00LT a request for a good rate of climb up to 5,000 ft. Thirty seconds later, the instruction to "maintain maximum speed of 250 kts and route direct to RANBI" was given. Soon after this, the Dubai DEP position was handed over to a different controller. The Investigation noted from the recorded conversations during this time that "no formal handover briefing took place between the two air traffic controllers" in relation to this handover. After this handover was complete and eight minutes after the A320 had taken off from Sharjah, the 737 checked in with Dubai DEP and was instructed to climb to 5000 feet. 25 seconds later, "the A320 crew was instructed to increase speed to 300 kts and shortly thereafter, the 737 was given a left turn onto a heading of 210º accompanied by a comment from the controller of “delaying action through the RANBI gate.” The 737 was also restricted to a maximum speed of 250 kts. After a further 25 seconds, the DEP Controller began a telephone call to the UAE ACC to achieve operational coordination of another, unrelated aircraft. During this call, the ACC controller alerted the DXB DEP controller "that separation was about to be lost between the A320 and the 737". The DXB DEP controller immediately issued avoiding action to the A320 with an instruction to turn onto a heading of 270º and then gave advisory information on the conflicting traffic and cleared the A320 to climb to 13,000ft. The 737 was then instructed to turn right onto a heading of 280º but as the crew were part way through reading back this instruction, they interrupted their transmission to inform DXB DEP that they had a TCAS 'CLIMB' RA. The controller then passed information on the conflicting traffic. Subsequently, the A320 advised of a TCAS 'DESCEND' and, after a further 13 seconds advised clear of conflict and returning to their originally cleared altitude of 13000 ft and heading 270º. The DXB DEP controller then advised the 737 that it was clear of traffic and cleared it to climb to 13,000 ft maintaining a heading of 210º. Radar recordings showed that the prescribed separation had been lost almost a minute prior to TCAS RA activation. Minimum separation was found to have occurred 5nm west of Dubai International Airport. It was noted that the "experienced and well trained" controller
