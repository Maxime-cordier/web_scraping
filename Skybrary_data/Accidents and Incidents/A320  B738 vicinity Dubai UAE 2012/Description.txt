On 22 April 2012, an Airbus A320 (A6-ABS) being operated by Air Arabia on a scheduled passenger flight from Sharjah to Istanbul as ABY0281 and a Boeing 737-800 (A6-FDK) being operated by flydubai on a scheduled passenger flight from Dubai to Doha as FDB17 came into conflict northwest of Dubai in night VMC whilst correctly following their respective ATC clearances. Coordinated TCAS RAs occurred and were followed which eliminated any risk of collision. ATC clearance error was attributed to an unstructured ATC position handover, the lack of STCA and the airspace structure.
