data. The comprehensiveness of the Investigation led to a number of useful observations which should be borne in mind if a productive investigation into the origins of a similar cabin air fumes-related event is being considered: As it is necessary to collect biological samples from crew members at an early stage, the safety investigation authority involved cannot act in isolation. Implementation of prior local agreements between aircraft operators and airport authorities and in particular dedicated airport emergency medical services where these exist would enable etiological medical examinations on crew members to be performed without delay.. To be effective, this type of response would require preparation so that agreements with aircraft operator and air crew representatives could be put in place so that the conditions in which samples would be taken are acceptable. It may also be useful if potential synergies with appropriate health care facilities in the vicinity of an airport to which affected crew could be directed were identified.. Occurrences which do not become the subject of an independent safety investigation could be the subject of an identical response process if aircraft operators or safety regulators deemed this appropriate.. The Final Report was published simultaneously in both English translation and in the definitive French language version on 3 November 2020. No Safety Recommendations were made.
