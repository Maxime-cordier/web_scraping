On 17 November 2017, an Airbus A320 (EC-HQJ) being operated by Vueling on a daytime scheduled international passenger flight from Geneva to Barcelona stopped its climb at FL290 after both pilots had begun to feel nauseous and when the situation did not improve, a PAN was declared advising crew incapacitation. A diversion to Marseilles was then flown without further developments but with both pilots on oxygen and they were both hospitalised for tests. There were no similar instances amongst the 154 occupants in the passenger cabin.
