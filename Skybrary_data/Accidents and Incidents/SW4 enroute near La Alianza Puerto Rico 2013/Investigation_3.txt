also positioned broadside against the relative wind and they also failed upward". It was also found that at some point in the upset sequence, the pilots had lowered the landing gear which may have been in an attempt to slow or regain control of the aircraft. The Investigation determined that the Probable Cause of the accident was "the flight crew's excessive elevator input during a rapid descent under night lighting conditions, which resulted in the overstress and breakup of the airplane". A Contributory Factor to the accident was determined as "an initial loss of airplane control for reasons that could not be determined because post accident examination revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation". The Final Report was adopted by the NTSB on 25 July 2016 and subsequently published. No Safety Recommendations were made.
