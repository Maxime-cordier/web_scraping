seen from the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data that the power levers had been prematurely moved to Flight Idle at 69 feet agl much earlier than recommended by the Company Operations Manual. The Investigation further noted that “the landing flare, which the (Operations Manual) recommends should be 'initiated when the main gear is a few feet above the runway', commenced at about 50 feet radio altitude and that, coincident with the elevator input to increase the pitch attitude for the landing flare, the pitch trim, which by this stage was not fully nose down, started to run in the nose up sense.” As a result of these factors, the aircraft eventually touched down with a pitch attitude of 8.3° compared to the 4-5° recommended and did so at an abnormally low speed of Vref - 20 knots. The overall conclusion was therefore that the lower than normal de-rotation after touchdown had been the result of a combination of the high landing pitch attitude, the elevator position and the abnormal aft centre of gravity position. The major contributors to the nose up pitch change were the negative thrust generated at Ground Idle power in combination with the aft centre of gravity. The inability of the flight crew to lower the nose using full nose down elevator was due to a reduction in elevator effectiveness caused by a combination of low speed and a change in airflow over the elevators caused by the negative thrust produced by the Ground Idle power setting.
