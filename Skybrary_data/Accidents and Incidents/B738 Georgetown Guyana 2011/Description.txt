On 30 July 2011, a Boeing 737-800 (9Y-PBM) being operated by Caribbean Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Port of Spain Trinidad to Georgetown as BW 523 overran the landing runway at destination after completing a night RNAV(GPS) approach in VMC. It descended down a 20 foot high earth embankment and stopped only after it had exited the airport perimeter and sustained such extensive damage that it was subsequently declared a hull loss. All 163 occupants successfully evacuated the wreckage but one serious injury and an unspecified but multiple number of minor injuries were sustained as a result of either the impact or the evacuation.
