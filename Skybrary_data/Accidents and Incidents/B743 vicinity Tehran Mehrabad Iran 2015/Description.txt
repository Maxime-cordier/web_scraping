On 15 October 2015, an uncontained No 3 engine failure occurred soon after take-off to a Boeing 747-300 (EP-MNE) being operated by Mahan Air on a domestic passenger flight from Tehran Mehrabad to Bandar Abbas as flight 1095 in day VMC. The adjacent outboard engine also failed after being damaged by ejected debris and the aircraft made a successful return to its departure airport but then had to be towed off the runway because hydraulic systems losses had disabled the nose wheel steering. Substantial damage was caused to both the airframe and both right hand engines. Although aircraft control difficulties after the failure caused considerable discomfort to passengers and cabin crew, there were no injuries and post-flight passenger disembarkation was completed normally.
