On 2 October 2021, an Airbus A320 (N922NK) being operated by Spirit Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Atlantic City to Fort Lauderdale as NK3044 ingested a large bird into its right engine during a daylight takeoff in normal ground visibility and the takeoff was rejected from just below V1 and the engine shut down. When a fuel-fed fire then fire ignited, an emergency evacuation was completed on the runway with four of the 109 occupants sustaining minor injuries during it including one identified as a crew member.
