On 3rd December 1999, a Boeing 737-500 being operated by Maersk Air on a scheduled passenger flight from Birmingham to Copenhagen made a successful diversion to Billund after two approaches and an earlier unsucessful one at the intended destination but landed with less than Final Reserve Fuel having declared an emergency on that account. Windshear warnings during the second aproach were ignored because of the low fuel status.
