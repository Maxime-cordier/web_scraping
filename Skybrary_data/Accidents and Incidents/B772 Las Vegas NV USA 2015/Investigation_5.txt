It was evident that if the left engine had been shut down sooner, there would have been less fuel pooling on the runway to feed the fire and hazard the fuselage. The Probable Cause of the accident was determined to be: “The failure of the left engine high-pressure compressor (HPC) stage 8-10 spool, which caused the main fuel supply line to become detached from the engine main fuel pump and release fuel, resulting in a fire on the left side of the airplane. The HPC stage 8-10 spool failed due to a sustained-peak low-cycle fatigue crack that initiated in the web of the stage 8 disk; the cause of the crack initiation could not be identified by physical inspection and stress and lifing analysis.” In addition, a Contributory Factor was formally identified as “the lack of inspection procedures for the stage 8 disk web”. Safety Action initiated by GE Aviation as a direct result of the accident included the following: the addition to the GE90 Engine Maintenance Manual of comprehensive non-destructive inspections for the HPC stage 8-10 spool web at the piece-part level as well as the rotor, module, and engine levels.. the issue of SB 72-1145 on 24 November 2015 for a one-time on-wing ultrasonic inspection of the stage 8 web of the stage 8-10 spools of all GE90 engines with specified part numbers which was followed by FAA AD 2015-27-01 based on the information contained within it.. the issue of SB 72-1146 on 12 February 2016 extended the requirement for a one-time on-wing ultrasonic inspection of the GE90 HPC stage 8 web of the stage 8-10 spools to all such spools which had the same part number as the accident spool that were not covered by SB 72-1145.. the issue of SB-1151 to supersede SB 1151 on 10 June 2016 expanding the inspection population to include GE90 HPC stage 8-10 spools with all other part numbers and additionally recommending a repetitive inspection every 500 cycles until an Eddy Current Inspection (ECI) was performed in place of a one-time on-wing ultrasonic inspection. Based on this SB, the FAA issued AD 2016-13-05 on 24 June 2016 requiring an ultrasonic inspection or an ECI of the stage 8 aft web upper face between 8,000 and 9,000 cycles since new or within 500 cycles in service after the effective date of the AD (July 29, 2016), whichever occurred later.. the modification of the print drawing for GE90 HPC stage 8-10 spools in production to include a check of the shot peen intensity in the outer web areas which was effective in February 2016.. the issue of SB 72-1149 on 29 March 2016 to address possible shot peening inconsistencies in all GE90 HPC Stage 8-10 spool web and Spacer arms.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 19 June 2018. No new Safety Recommendations were made but attention was drawn to the two Recommendations made in February 2018 as a result of the investigation into a similar uncontained engine failure to
