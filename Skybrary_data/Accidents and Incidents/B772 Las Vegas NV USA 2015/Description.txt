On 8 September 2015, a Boeing 777-200ER (G-VIIO) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled passenger flight from Las Vegas to London Gatwick as BA 2276 with an augmented crew rejected take off on runway 07L at Las Vegas in day VMC when a very loud noise was heard from the vicinity of the left engine, a GE90-85B. It soon became apparent that the engine had suffered a catastrophic and uncontained failure as a result of which a fuel fed fire developed rapidly as soon as the aircraft came to a stop. An emergency evacuation of the 170 occupants was successfully accomplished but in the process one crew member was seriously injured and 19 passengers sustained minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial but repairable damage but the failed engine was destroyed.
