On 2 September 2013, an Airbus A330-200 (PT-MVL) being operated by TAM on a scheduled international passenger flight from Madrid to SÃ£o Paulo Guarulhos, Brazil, under ETOPS encountered sudden severe turbulence as it transited the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) at night in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). As a result of injuries sustained by 12 of the 156 passengers (two being serious) and 3 of the 13 cabin crew (one being serious), a diversion to Fortaleza was made landing there 1 hour and 40 minutes later. Minor cabin trim damage was caused by the impact of unrestrained passengers with the cabin roof. It was subsequently determined that AFM load limits had not been exceeded during the event.
