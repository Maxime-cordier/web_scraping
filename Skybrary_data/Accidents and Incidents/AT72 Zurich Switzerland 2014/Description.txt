On 4 December 2014, an ATR 72-200 (D-ANFE) being operated by the German Company Avanti Air on a scheduled passenger flight from Dresden to Zurich as DWT286 on behalf of Etihad Regional touched down normally on runway 14 at destination in normal day visibility. Soon afterwards, both nose landing gear tyres failed and the wheel rims dropped onto the runway surface. After clearing the runway, the aircraft was stopped, the emergency services were called for and the 30 occupants were eventually taken to the terminal by bus. The aircraft nose landing gear sustained substantial damage and the runway surface - minor damage.
