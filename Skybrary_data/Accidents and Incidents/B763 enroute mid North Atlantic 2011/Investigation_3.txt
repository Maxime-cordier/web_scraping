for sleep and subsequently worsened the sleep inertia.. By identifying the oncoming aircraft, the captain engaged the first officer (FO) before the effects of sleep inertia had worn off.. Under the effects of sleep inertia, the first officer perceived the oncoming aircraft to be on a collision course and pushed forward on the control column.. The frequency of training and depth of the training material on fatigue risk management to which the flight crew were exposed were such that the risks associated with fatigue were not adequately understood and procedures for conducting controlled rest were not followed by the flight crew.. Although the seatbelt sign was on and an announcement about potential turbulence was made, several passengers were injured during the event because they were not wearing their seatbelt.. The formal statement of Findings as to Risk was as follows: North American-based pilots flying eastbound at night towards Europe are at increased risk of fatigue-related performance decrements.. The use of multiple safety occurrence reporting systems may result in some safety issues not being properly identified and analyzed.. Some passengers may not be aware of the inherent risks in not wearing a seatbelt at all times when seated.. Safety Action taken by Air Canada in response to the Investigation findings - the issue of a series of crew reminders and the initiation of research on crew alertness eastbound on the incident route - was noted. The Final Report of the Investigation: Aviation Investigation Report A11F0012 was authorised for release on 29 February 2012. No Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation.
