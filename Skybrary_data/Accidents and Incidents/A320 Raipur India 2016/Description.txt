On 14 December 2016, an Airbus A320 (VT-IGK) being operated by Indigo on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Delhi to Raipur as 6E-201 during which a trainee First Officer was operating under supervision made a very hard bounced landing after a day VMC ILS approach which considerably exceeded the 2.6 g airframe structural limit despite the Training Captain taking over during the flare after assessing it to be insufficient.
