(TLA) was briefly increased from 22.5° to 36.5° before being set to idle was followed by a final touchdown at a recorded 3.2 g with a 6.3° pitch attitude and an almost 700 fpm rate of descent. CVR data confirmed the Captain’s statement that when he announced he was taking control, there was a continued lack of response from the First Officer. In a statement to the aircraft operator, the First Officer subsequently accepted that “she was totally focussed on maintaining the (runway) centreline and did not (make an) adequate flare input in time”. The aircraft was withdrawn from service and preliminary inspections and tests carried out at Raipur with no findings of damage. After five days a special permit to position it to Delhi for further maintenance assessment required by Airbus was obtained and once there, the main and nose landing gear were replaced in accordance with AMM requirements and the aircraft was released to service on 30 December. The Probable Cause of the accident was determined to be the inadequate landing flare made by the First Officer. Contributory Factors were also identified as “the Captain’s delay in deciding to take control and as a result not initiating a timely go-around”. Safety Recommendations were confined to a requirement that the pilots involved should both receive necessary corrective training. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed on 4 January 2019 but not released until 12 February 2020.
