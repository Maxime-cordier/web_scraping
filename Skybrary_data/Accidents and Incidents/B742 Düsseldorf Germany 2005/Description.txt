On 24 January 2005, a Boeing 747-200F being operated by Atlas Air on a scheduled cargo flight from Dubai to DÃ¼sseldorf touched down in normal visibility at night at destination but was unable to achieve sufficient braking on the contaminated runway after initially normal deceleration and overran the end. It collided with ground obstacles before coming to a stop where it became apparent that engines 2 and 3 were on fire. The 3 person flight crew evacuated and were unhurt but the aircraft was sufficiently damaged for it to be declared a hull loss.
