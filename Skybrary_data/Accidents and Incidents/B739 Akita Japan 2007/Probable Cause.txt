The JTSB identified the following probable cause and contributory factors: "It is estimated that this serious incident was caused by that the captain and the first officer made a landing by misidentifying the parallel taxiway for the runway.. Concerning this misidentification, such factors are considered contributory as forgetting and failing to reconfirm the relative location between the runway and the taxiway, deterioration of local visibility under the visual meteorological condition and the lack of knowledge about the fact that VOR No.1 approach course runs in parallel with the runway. In addition, it is considered that captainâ€™s mistaken belief that the FDGC in the HUD display had indicated direction to the runway was also a contributory factor.". The Report provides no Safety Recommendations. As a result of the investigation, Korean Airlines added and modified the Company Airway Manual regarding operations into Akita Airport that upon arrival, when using VOR DME RWY 10 APP, caution must be exercised not to confuse runway with taxiway especially in poor visibility due to fog or snow.
