On 7 April 2017, when a Boeing 747-400 (VH-OJU) being operated by Qantas Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Melbourne to Hong Kong with an augmenting crew member present on the flight deck entered a holding pattern part way through descent in day VMC, a series of stall protection system activations occurred during an upset involving multiple oscillations in pitch and vertical acceleration. During this upset, four of the cabin crew and two unsecured passengers sustained minor injuries after striking the cabin ceiling and furnishings. A series of toilet smoke warnings which began immediately after the upset were confirmed to be false and were later attributed to damage to the toilet cubicle which had occurred during the event.
