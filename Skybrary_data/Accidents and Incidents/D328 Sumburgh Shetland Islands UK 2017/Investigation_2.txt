engage after touchdown except for brief periods". It was concluded that the origin of the excursion was the unintended inappropriate reversal of the initial aileron deflection and the inappropriate increase in power to flight idle which created a situation in which there was "insufficient directional control in the strong crosswind conditions to prevent the aircraft from leaving the runway" with the only intermittent engagement of nosewheel steering during the landing roll "contributing to the handling difficulties". The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 14 September 2017.
