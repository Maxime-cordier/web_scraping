forced the controllers in sector D1E to focus their attention on managing these aircraft, a task that was not properly coordinated with the newly-opened sector TGR.. The temporary outage of the air navigation data network, which caused the radar display for traffic below 3200 feet to be lost, along with the updated flight plans and communications between Girona and the Barcelona ACC, which required the use of telephone communications. All of this contributed to having the TGR sector controllers focus their attention on determining the position of aircraft EC-GGF, inbound to Girona. This, combined with the loss of coordination with sector D1E, led to them to become unaware of other traffic affecting them.. Safety Action agreed as a result of the various effects of the voice and radar data communications failure which had materially contributed to the conflict was noted as having been the "replacement of the differential breaker with one that resets automatically and the installation of an aural alarm".

[49/16]. that AESA should review the hazard identification and assessment of risks associated with recent loss of separation events in the Barcelona TMA, as well as the proposed mitigation measures that ENAIRE was recommended to undertake in Recommendation 49/16. [50/16]. The Final Report of the Investigation was approved on 28 June 2017. No further Safety Recommendations were made in it.
