On 28 September 2016, a Boeing 737-400 (SP-ENA) being operated by Enter Air on an international non revenue positioning flight from Warsaw to Girona as ENT 1237 and a Cessna 172 (EC-JOB) being operated by Barcelona Flight School for instructional purposes out of Sabadell were both making procedural VOR/DME approaches to runway 02 at Girona under IFR but in day VMC. Both pilots had the other aircraft in sight as they neared final approach from opposite directions and when a TCAS RA was annunciated on board the 737 and it became visually obvious that continuing with their respective tracks would be hazardous, the Cessna initiated a 360Â° turn to clear the anticipated track of the 737 and any risk of collision was averted.
