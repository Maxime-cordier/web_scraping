The following is an extract from the official National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB) Report (NYC06IA207) on the Serious Incident: "According to the maintenance technician seated in the cockpit, he was "riding the brakes" while the airplane was being towed at walking speed, when he felt a bump, which was followed by the collapse of the nose landing gear. According to Continental Airlines representatives, the nose landing gear collapsed forward into the wheel well. The nose landing gear remained attached to the airplane by its primary trunnion support and upper drag brace. The lock brace assembly fractured in close proximity to the lock link. The lower drag brace was fractured near the center of its length. The tow bar shear pin was also fractured during the incident. The nose landing gear lock actuator, upper drag brace, lower drag brace, lock brace, and retract actuator were forwarded to the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory, Washington, D.C., for further examination. All fractures were consistent with overstress separation and no evidence of fatigue cracking or any other pre-existing conditions were found. The fracture on the lower drag brace exhibited deformation consistent with the fracture location moving downward relative to the ends. The bending deformation was consistent with the collapse of the gear following buckling of the lower drag brace."
