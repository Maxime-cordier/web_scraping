"Examination and testing of the nose landing gear actuator assembly, lock actuator, left hand nose gear steering actuator, depressurization steering valve, and steering metering valve, which was supervised by a Safety Board investigator, did not reveal any pre-incident discrepancies. The 737-300/-400/-500 airplane maintenance manual, page 213, alerted operators, that at a minimum, applying airplane brakes while towing the airplane could shear the towbar shear pins. Examination of the ground surrounding the airplane after the incident did not reveal any main landing gear tire skid marks."
