a cross check according to multi crew principles must be avoided until the resting crew member resumes his duties.. It was considered by the Investigation that "the presence of cabin crew (on the flight deck) during controlled rest would enhance the alertness of the remaining crew" and that "this should also reduce (the chances of) inadvertent action to some extent". The Probable Cause of the event was formally determined as "the First Officer inadvertently fed the Altitude window on the Mode Control Panel with the corrected track of 292ยบ and activated it thereby causing the altitude of the aircraft to drop." Two Safety Recommendations were made as follows: that the Co-Pilot (involved) should be given corrective training on fight automation systems.. that the DGAC should take any other action deemed appropriate.. The Final Report was released on 28 December 2015.
