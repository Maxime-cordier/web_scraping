around from runway 34 overflew the runway 27/34 intersection climbing through 600 feet, the 777 was still on the runway south of the intersection and the 737 going around from 27 was almost over the runway 27 threshold and climbing through 1,200 feet. As the 737 going around from runway 34 passed 1,000 feet in the climb still over the runway (see the illustration below) the trainee controller was instructed to tell it to turn right onto north whilst it was still below the 2,000 feet Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA). At this time, the 777, now airborne, was north of the runway 27/34 intersection climbing through 800 feet and the 737 was just east of it and climbing ahead through 1,700 feet. Soon after this the trainee controller issued a wake turbulence caution to the flight crew of 737 going around from runway 34 in relation to the 777 which had just taken off from the same runway. Subsequently, all aircraft were “tracking well clear of each other” on divergent flight paths. The 777 continued en-route and the two 737s were then re-sequenced to land at Melbourne without further event. It was noted that at no time had traffic information been provided to the 777 in respect of either of the 737s. Surveillance data was subsequently examined and showed that separation between the two 737s had reduced to about 0.9 nm and 900 feet as the one going around from runway 27 had crossed runway 34 in front of the one going around from that runway. It was noted that responsibility for maintaining separation lay with the TWR controller and the only available standard was visual separation which, because of “the limitations of human vision at night and the disposition and trajectory of traffic at the time” could not be assured. It was also found that although the 737 sent around from its approach to runway 34 did not fly through the flight path of the departing 777, it was only 1½ nm behind it instead of the applicable wake turbulence separation minimum of 5 nm. A number of aspects of the event and its context were examined during the Investigation, including the following: The entrance to the full length of runway 34 had a yellow marked centreline intended for use by aircraft exiting from the 16 direction as well as taxiway lighting which when followed results in a 90° turn to line up for takeoff, as Illustrated below. Both the trainee and her OJTI stated that when the 777 was issued with clearance for an immediate take-off, they had expected it to line up via the 16 exit line which aircraft sometimes do. However, it was noted this assumption was at variance with the requirements of an immediate takeoff clearance which are only that the aircraft shall taxi onto the runway and commence takeoff in one continuous movement. The aircraft operator also subsequently confirmed that performance calculations for the departure involved had required use of the full runway length..
