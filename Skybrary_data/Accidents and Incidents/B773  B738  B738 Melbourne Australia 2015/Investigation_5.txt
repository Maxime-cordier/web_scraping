suspended at Melbourne and Adelaide airports on 10 November 2015. An assessment of the obstacles in the Melbourne Airport area was then conducted which confirmed that aircraft complying with controller-issued headings of up to 50Â° left of the extended centreline of runway 27 and right of the extended centreline of runway 34 following a missed approach would safely clear all relevant obstacles. On 22 April 2016, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority issued an exemption to Airservices Australia to radar vector aircraft below the minimum vector altitude in relation to aircraft carrying out simultaneous go-arounds on runway 27 and runway 34 at Melbourne Airport at night during LAHSO. On the same day, night LAHSO were reinstated at Melbourne.. Training in night-time compromised separation recovery during LAHSO was completed by all Melbourne Tower controllers in March 2016.. On 10 March 2016, an arrival stagger was introduced for LAHSO arrival pairs at Melbourne to ensure that, in the event of a missed approach, the aircraft would not be in unsafe proximity at the runway intersection.. The Final Report was released on 6 August 2018. No Safety Recommendations were made.
