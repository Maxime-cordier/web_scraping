An Investigation was carried out by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). It was established that the TWR position was being occupied by a trainee controller accompanied by an OJTI who had held a Melbourne Aerodrome Control Rating for 6½ years. A ‘Tower Coordinator’ was also present - he had held a Melbourne Aerodrome Control Rating since 1996 - as was another controller tasked with Ground Movement Control and Clearance Delivery. The trainee controller instructed the 777 to line up on runway 34 following discussion with her OJTI. At this time, the two 737s were on approach, one for runway 34 and one for the shorter runway 27. Both were about 5 nm from the threshold of their respective runways with Land and Hold Short Operations in use. About 30 seconds later, as the 777 continued to taxi towards the runway, it was cleared for an immediate take-off and, after making a 90° turn to line up on the full length of the runway, commenced its take-off. This manoeuvre took longer than the trainee controller and her OJTI had expected and as the 777 began its take-off roll, the 737 on approach to land on the intersecting runway 27 had about 2½ nm to go and the 737 on approach to land on runway 34 had less than 2 nm. The trainee tower controller requested the flight crew of the 737 approaching runway 27 to reduce to minimum speed and its crew responded that they already were at that speed. Her OJTI then told the trainee to tell the crew that in the event of a missed approach, they should expedite climb to 4,000 ft as there was traffic departing runway 34. In response the 737 crew, descending through approximately 900 feet, announced that they were going around. Meanwhile, the other 737 was passing 800 feet on approach to runway 34. At this point the Tower Coordinator “expressed concern” that the departing 777 was still on runway 34 and that the required runway separation standard would not be maintained against the approaching 737. After he had “received what he deemed an unsatisfactory response from the tower OJTI” he then instructed the trainee controller to instruct the 737 on final to runway 34 to go around. As she did this, a runway 34 occupancy caution activated because the 737 was less than 15 seconds from the threshold. This caution almost immediately changed to a warning which is triggered when an aircraft is less than 10 seconds from the threshold. The 777 was still less than half way along the runway and the 737 going around from runway 27 was less than 1 nm from the 27 threshold and climbing through 1,100 feet. The trainee controller, intending to advise the flight crew of the 737 she had just instructed to go around from runway 34 that another 737 was currently going around from runway 27, transmitted instead traffic information that another 737 was going around from runway 34. As the 737 going
