path using glide slope indications that were not valid, resulting in an incorrect assessment that the aircraft was above the nominal descent profile.. The combination of the selection of an ineffective altitude target while using the auto-flight Open Descent mode and ineffective monitoring of the aircraft’s flight path resulted in a significant deviation below the nominal descent profile.. The flight crew’s action to reduce the aircraft's rate of descent following detection of the altitude deviation did not prevent the aircraft descending outside controlled airspace and the activation of the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System.. Other Factors that increased risk Qantas provided limited guidance on the conduct of a visual approach and the associated briefing required to enable the flight crew to have a shared understanding of the intended approach. (Safety issue). The Captain’s performance capability was probably reduced due to the combined effects of disrupted and restricted sleep, limited recent nutrition and a cold/virus.. Other Findings The flight crew acted to reduce the aircraft's rate of descent prior to the activation of the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) and conducted a recovery manoeuvre immediately after the EGPWS ‘PULL UP’ warning.. Safety Action taken by Qantas in relation to the identified 'Safety Issue' was noted as: Updating of guidance material for visual approaches in their flight training library.. Provision of enhanced material on visual approaches in the Captain and First Officer conversion/promotion training books which included targeted questions that required [Cross-checking Process|Check Pilot]] sign-off for proficiency.. Adding visual approaches as a subject for discussion during flight crew route checks for 2013/2014 and 2015.. The Final Report was published on 9 July 2015. No Safety Recommendations were made.
