On 8 March 2013, the crew of an Airbus A330-200 (VH-EBV) being operated by Qantas on a scheduled passenger flight from Sydney to Melbourne unintentionally descended prematurely during an attempt by the crew to fly an approved visual approach in day VMC and activation of an Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) 'PULL UP' Warning was followed by a full recovery climbing to 4000 feet. None of the 222 occupants were injured during that manoeuvre.
