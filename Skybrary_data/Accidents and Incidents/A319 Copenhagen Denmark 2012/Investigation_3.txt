ground speed for the turn involved was “only 20 knots on DRY surface and favourable circumstances. Any contamination will call for an even lower speed” and a few days later the following sentence: “The design of the high speed exit is according to ICAO standards, with a speed limitation of 15 knots on DRY surface. This calls for a significant lower speed in wet or contaminated conditions”. In addition, the Airport Operator decided to publish a Notice To Airmen as follows: ”RWY 22L leaving rapid exit TWY B4, the curved end of TWY B4 is designed for a max 15 knots in dry conditions only. Hotspot chart will be issued SAP in AIP Denmark, AD2-EKCH-ADC”. The Final Report of the Investigation was published in English during 2013. No Safety Recommendations were made.
