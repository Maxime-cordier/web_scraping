On 21 September 2012, an Airbus A319 being operated SAS on a passenger flight from Oslo to Copenhagen and which had just landed at destination lost directional control in daylight and normal ground visibility and left the paved surface onto grass where a right turn from the rapid entry taxiway (RET) onto an almost-parallel taxiway is required. The nose landing gear became embedded in the soft surface and the aircraft stopped. There were no injuries to the occupants who were subsequently transported to the terminal by bus. The left hand engine ingested parts of some signage hit during the excursion and the cowling and fan were damaged.
