The NTSB determines the probable cause of this incident as follows: "The fatigue and subsequent fracture of a portion of the airplane's pressure bulkhead, which resulted in a rapid decompression during cruise flight.". Following the examination of the incident airplane, Alert Revision 4 was amended to specify more frequent inspections of the affected area. "Alert Revision 4 adds the requirement for repeated inspections of areas 1 and 2, at 500 flight-cycle intervals once the airplane has reached 20,000 flight cycles. It also decreased the inspection intervals of area 3 from 6,000 flight-cycles to 1,500 flight-cycles.".
