On 29 November 2016, a BAe Avro RJ85 (CP 2933) being operated by LaMia Airlines on an international passenger charter flight from Santa Cruz (Viru Viru), Bolivia to Medellín International (Rionegro), Colombia as LME 2339 declared a fuel related emergency shortly after encountering a traffic-related delay to its approach at destination. As ATC prioritised its approach from the south to runway 01 in night IMC, contact was lost and the aircraft was subsequently discovered to have crashed into terrain which was almost 1,500 feet higher than the altitude of the airport 10nm further south. There was no fire but the aircraft was destroyed and 71 of the 77 occupants were killed, 5 sustained serious injuries and one was documented as “unharmed/minor injury”. Three of the four operating crew members, including both pilots, were amongst those killed and the surviving member of the cabin crew was one of those seriously injured.
