On 7th February 2001, an Airbus A320-200 being operated by Iberia on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Barcelona to Bilbao with pilot early-stage line training in progress and a safety pilot present was about to make a night touch down in VMC and light surface winds when it experienced unexpected windshear and a very hard landing followed. The aircraft did not leave the paved surface but severe airframe structural damage was sustained and there were injuries to 25 of the 143 occupants, one serious, during the subsequent evacuation.
