On 24 February 2016, an almost new Viking DHC6-400 (9N-AHH) being operated by Tara Air on a daytime scheduled domestic passenger flight from Pokhara to Jomsom on a VFR flight plan did not arrive at the intended destination and was subsequently found to have crashed into high terrain en-route resulting in its destruction with this and a post crash fire resulting in fatal injuries to all 23 occupants.
