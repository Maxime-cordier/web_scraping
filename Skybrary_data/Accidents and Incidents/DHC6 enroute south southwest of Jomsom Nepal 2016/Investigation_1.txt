An Investigation was carried out by an Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission (AAIC) established for the purpose by the Government of Nepal the day after the accident had occurred in accordance with provisions of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Regulation 2014. The wreckage of the aircraft was located at 10,982 feet amsl on a sloping hillside near the entrance to the valley in which Jomsom Airport is situated. The 53 year-old Captain, joined the Operator when it began operations in 2009 as an Instructor Pilot on the DHC6. He had accumulated a total of 20,108 flying hours, of which 18,500 hours were on type. All his airline flying experience had been gained with Nepalese operators. He was the Tara Air DHC6-300 and -400 Deputy Chief Pilot and had piloted the delivery (ferry) flight of the accident aircraft from Canada in September 2015. Including that flight, he had 217 hours experience on the -400 variant. The 29 year-old First Officer joined the Operator in 2014 on the DHC6-300 in his first job as a professional pilot. He had a total of 760 flying hours of which 560 hours were on the DHC6 but only 14 of those on the Viking -400 variant. Both pilots had received differences training on the Viking -400 variant of the DHC6 and had completed a “familiarisation flight” on it. Both were also paired for a routine 5 day/4 night posting to operate from Pokhara after travelling from their base in Kathmandu. The flight departed from runway 22 at Pokhara (2,700 feet amsl) on a VFR clearance to destination climbing to 10,500 feet QNH with the First Officer-- acting as PF. Pokhara had only just opened after the prevailing visibility rose above 5km and the designated alternate, Bhairahawa, was closed due to poor weather. On reaching 500 feet agl, the aircraft turned right to take up a heading of 305° towards the GHORI (Ghorepani) waypoint - the ground track of the flight is on the illustration below. Whilst climbing through 10,100 feet around five miles before reaching the ‘GHORI’, the Captain was recorded as observing that “cloud cells were still present” and instructing the First Officer to continue the climb to 12,000 feet. He then stated that they would continue until reaching waypoint ‘TPANI’ before deciding whether to continue or divert. After reaching GHORI ten minutes after takeoff, the aircraft turned right and initially maintained a heading of 330°. At 11,500 feet, the area in the vicinity was in cloud and just after passing the waypoint, a brief EGPWS ‘TERRAIN’ PULL UP Warning was annunciated. The climb was continued and the flight emerged from cloud soon afterwards. Half a minute later, with the flight now “just below cloud”, the Captain instructed the First Officer to maintain a heading of 330° and “a shallow descent was initiated”. In response to a question from the Captain as to whether his side was visual, the First Officer said he was “somewhat visual” and the Captain then instructed him to continue descent to
