On 18 August 2015, a Boeing B737-800 (VT-JFA) being operated by Jet Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Doha, Qatar to Cochin India as 9W-555 (JAI 955) was unable to land off three ILS approaches at destination around dawn after failing to obtain the required visual reference at DA and diverted to alternate Trivandrum where, after an also-unsuccessful non-precision approach in day IMC, a MAYDAY was declared for low fuel. Two unsuccessful "visual" approaches to the same runway at Trivandrum then followed before a seventh approach, also "visual" in the reciprocal runway direction led to an ultimately uneventful emergency landing.
