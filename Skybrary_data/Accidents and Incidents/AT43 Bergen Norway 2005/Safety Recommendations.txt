Two Safety Recommendations were issued as a result of this Investigation, both to JAA / European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), who were recommended to: Consider whether the regulations should be amended in order that systems that are critical to safety are double checked following maintenance work. Special consideration should be made as to whether the manufacturer should be given a responsibility on this matter. (12/2006). Consider whether the regulations (Appendix 1 JAR OPS 1.1045 pt. 11) should specify that procedures must be drawn up for preservation of data from flight and cockpit voice recorders and included in operation manuals, so that the JAR OPS 1.160 requirements are better adhered to. (13/2006). The Final Report was submitted in April 2006 and may be seen at SKYbrary bookshelf: AIBN SL RAP.: 8/2006
