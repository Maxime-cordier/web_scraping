attention to the bolts/nuts/bearings in the hinges.. The relevant DVI was performed in February 2003 without discovering the incorrect assembly.. The bolt in the centre hinge assembly had, at an earlier point in time, probably several months before the accident, fallen out of the hinge and into a space in the elevator structure.. After the bolt in the outboard hinge assembly fell out during take-off, the elevator was only attached to the stabiliser by the inboard hinge.. Since the outer part of the elevator was then hanging below the stabiliser, it was difficult to maintain normal control of the aircraft.. Electrical Power was not disconnected from the 30 minute CVR promptly after landing and so recordings from the period in question were lost.. Overall, it was noted that: “a maintenance error was introduced onto an aircraft during maintenance work on a safety-critical system. The error was not discovered during the double inspection immediately following installation, later maintenance work, various inspections, checks or pre-flight check of elevator function. Several safety barriers seem to have failed in turn, so that one single error was allowed to develop into a serious situation involving control problems during flight. Such circumstantial factors as position of the centre of gravity, weather conditions and the fact that the aircraft did not receive consequential damage when the elevator detached, all contributed to it being possible for the crew to handle the situation and carry out a controlled landing.”
