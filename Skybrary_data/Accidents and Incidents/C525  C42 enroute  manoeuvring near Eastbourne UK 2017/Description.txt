On 7 March 2017, a Cessna 525 Citation in Class 'G' airspace came into very close proximity with an unseen Ikarus C42 in day VMC at an altitude of 3,500 feet after the pilot of the C42 had, following a late sighting, executed last minute avoiding action to effect a recorded separation of less than 100 feet vertically and less than 185 metres laterally. Both aircraft were operating VFR in good forward visibility.
