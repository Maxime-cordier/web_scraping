called Farnborough Radar to report the AIRPROX and had then returned to the scene in order to squawk for Farnborough and allow the location to be recorded before continuing the training detail. This pilot provided video evidence of the event to the Investigation - see the stills sequence reproduced below. Area radar evidence submitted by the ANSP showed (see the illustration below) the two aircraft with altitude tags (the C42 had a Mode C Transponder and the Citation a Mode S Transponder) approaching each other almost head on just 12 seconds prior to the CPA (Closest Point of Approach). This was the point when the Citation had reported "crossing the coast" and been directed to call Farnborough Radar by the London Information FISO. The Investigation noted that UK Regulatory requirements prevent a FISO from utilising surveillance-derived data to provide traffic information when providing a Basic Service which since the Citation was VFR was the only type of service that could be offered. The UK CAA notes that such a Basic Service "relies on the pilot avoiding other traffic unaided by controllers / FISOs". It was noted that the fact that the Citation had been transferred by London Control to London Information whilst still inside controlled airspace had been "non-standard" since "an ATC service cannot be provided by a FISO to an aircraft inside controlled airspace". The Board concluded that the Cause of the occurrence was "a late sighting by the C42 pilot and a non-sighting by the C525 pilot". One Contributory Factor was also identified: The C525 pilot reported not receiving a TCAS alert (for which no explanation could be found from the evidence available).. The Final Report of the Investigation was agreed in principle on 21 June 2017 and subsequently published. The ICAO Risk Category 'A' was assigned (an aircraft proximity in which serious risk of collision existed). No Safety Recommendations were made.
