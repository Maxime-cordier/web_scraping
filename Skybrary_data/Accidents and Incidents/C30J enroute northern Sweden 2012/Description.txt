On 15 March 2012, a Lockheed-Martin C130J-30 Hercules being operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force on a positioning transport flight from Harstad/Narvik Airport, Norway to Kiruna, Sweden flew into the side of the highest mountain in Sweden near its summit shortly after crossing the Swedish border and making a daylight descent to FL070 which took it into Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) in uncontrolled airspace. The aircraft was immediately destroyed by the violent impact, consequent explosion and fire and all five occupants were killed.
