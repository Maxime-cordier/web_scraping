On 30 November 2014, an ATR 72-500 (SE-MBD) being operated by Braathens Regional on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Stockholm Bromma to Visby as DC 929 was descending through 7,000 feet in day VMC when severe vibrations of apparent propeller origin suddenly began. The crew concluded that the source of these was the right engine and after feathering the propeller, that engine was shut down and the vibrations ceased. An emergency was declared to ATC and the flight to destination was completed without further event.
