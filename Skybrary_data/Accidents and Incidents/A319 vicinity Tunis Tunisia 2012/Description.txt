On 24 March 2012, an Airbus A319 (F-GRHU) being operated by Air France on a scheduled passenger flight from Paris CDG to Tunis as AF2184 attempted a visual contact Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) with insufficient track miles. Lack of stabilisation culminated in an Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) PULL UP activation and a low altitude orbit on final approach before a visual circuit was carried out to a normal second approach and a successful landing. There were no occupant injuries and no resultant aircraft damage.
