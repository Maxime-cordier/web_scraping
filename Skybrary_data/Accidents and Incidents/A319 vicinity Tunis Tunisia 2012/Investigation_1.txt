An Investigation was carried out by the French Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA) using data from the QAR, ATC R/T recordings and testimonies. The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) was record of the event was overwritten. It was noted that the aircraft commander had been promoted to Captain on the A320 four years previously after 11 years as a Co-pilot and had accumulated 1700 hours in type in command. The First Officer had 1700 hours experience on the A320 with Air France. A reconstruction of the flight was made using all available evidence. The diagram below shows the achieved vertical profile based on FDR data from 35nm out when the aircraft was still above FL200. The aircraft commander was the PF and after initially descending the aircraft in V/S mode at 1000 fpm, but after a change of runway from 29 to 19, he selected ‘OPEN DES’ Mode and a speed of 300 KIAS with the air brakes deployed. At this point and cleared for an ILS approach to runway 19, FDR data showed that the aircraft was passing FL207 and was 33 nm from the threshold of the landing runway. With 20 nm to go and, the selected speed was reduced to 240 knots which reduced the rate of descent. The AP was disconnected passing FL100 and the aircraft was established on the ILS LOC at a range of approximately 8nm when passing 6000 feet QNH with a speed of 250 knots. Since this put the aircraft at about 3400 feet above the ILS GS, the crew applied the prescribed procedure for capture of the ILS GS from above - but ignored the stipulation that this procedure should not be used if the rate of descent exceeds 2500fpm. At a range of 5nm, the passing altitude was 2640 feet, the speed was 240 knots and the rate of descent was 4400fpm. The flaps were still retracted. The thrust levers were selected to Idle and the aircraft was cleared to land. Eight seconds later, the PM advised ATC that they were “a little above the path” and requested a 360° turn to the right. The controller asked for this request to be repeated whilst the PF re-engaged the A/THR and AP “so that the latter could intercept the glide path”. QAR data showed that this action was followed by an EGPWS ‘SINK RATE’ Alert as the AP captured the ILS GS when 2.8nm from the runway and passing 836 feet agl but the aircraft continued descent below it at 2500 fpm and 220 knots. An EGPWS ‘PULL UP’ Warning was then annunciated followed by a ‘TOO LOW TERRAIN’ Alert. ATC then approved a 360° turn to the left, which was acknowledged by the PM and the descent was arrested with a minimum of 398 feet reached. Flaps 1 was selected, the air brakes were retracted and the AP was disconnected but the left turn was not commenced and the controller repeated the clearance. FDR data showed that after 13 seconds had
