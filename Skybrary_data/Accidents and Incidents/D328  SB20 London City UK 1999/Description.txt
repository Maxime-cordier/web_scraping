On 15 April 1999, a Dornier 328 operated by ScotAirways was cleared to the holding point of RWY28 at London City. The Dornier 328 crossed the holding point while a Saab 2000 was decelerating after landing on the same runway and the separation between the two aircraft was reduced to 10 meters as the landing aircraft passed. The runway incursion was subsequently attributed to distraction.
