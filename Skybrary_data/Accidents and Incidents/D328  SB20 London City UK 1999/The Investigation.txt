The UK AAIB concluded the following: The incident was caused when the Dornier crew, having been distracted by a flight deck warning indication, taxied their aircraft beyond the holding point to which they had been cleared. Later, some confusion occurred over the crew's misinterpretation of ATC taxi instructions which precipitated the necessity to instruct landing traffic to go-around.. No Safety Recommendations are included in the Report.
