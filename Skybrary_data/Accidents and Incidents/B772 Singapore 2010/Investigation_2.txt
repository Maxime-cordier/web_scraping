of the turbine exhaust nozzle was missing. There was also damage to the inboard flap fairing and flaperon, consistent with the separation of the items from the engine, with scraping and gouge damage on the right lower wing skin and the right horizontal stabiliser. The manufacturer’s initial examination of the engine indicated that buckling damage to the inner wall D-duct was consistent with a ‘typical of loss of stability due to disbond of inner facesheet’ and that this form of failure had been seen on a number of previous occasions.” It was noted that the investigated event was the first of its type to affect a British Airways aircraft but that there had previously been ten other events on Boeing 777 aircraft fitted with the same Rolls Royce RB211 Trent 895 engines and two others since. As a result of the earlier events, two successive Service Bulletins (SBs) had been issued by Boeing in 2005 and 2008 requiring specified engine inspections, at first one-off and then repetitively. A final SB to address the problem with a design modification was found to have been issued by Boeing in late 2009 but it was noted that “there was some initial delay in the approval by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) of the design change included within this SB, as EASA was requesting further data and design substantiation from the airframe manufacturer” so that the approval had not been granted at the time of the investigated event. The Final Report AAIB Bulletin: 10/2011 EW/C2010/06/05 of the Investigation was published on 6 October 2011. No Safety Recommendations were made.
