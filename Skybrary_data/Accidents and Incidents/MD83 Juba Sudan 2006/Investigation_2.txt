the dual hydraulic system was configured so that the right hand system provided power for rudder and landing gear operation while the left hand system provided power for the elevator augmenter with all other hydraulically powered services served by both systems which were as usual in hydraulic system design, linked by a Power Transfer Unit (PTU) which automatically shuts down in the event of low contents in one system. Examination of the aircraft after the accident found that whilst the right hydraulic system had been functioning normally, the left hydraulic reservoir was empty, which was attributed to a breach in a hydraulic fluid return pipe in the left hand system which had resulted in this system loosing its fluid to atmosphere at some point en route prior to the accident landing “without the pilots noticing”. The effect of this had then been the unexpected retraction of the left wing spoilers after landing which would have occurred as soon as hydraulic accumulator pressure had been exhausted in the few seconds after touch down. However the resulting tendency of the aircraft to veer to the right due to the asymmetric deceleration effect of the still-extended right wing extended spoilers was successfully counteracted by the appropriate use of the rudder which operates only from the right hydraulic system. The breach in the return pipe was attributed - without stated supporting evidence being discussed - to “severe tightening” during maintenance activity some time previously. It was considered that there may have been opportunity for the crew to have detected abnormal system status during their pre or in flight checks and thus proactively reviewed the likely consequences of planning to conduct the landing as if the aircraft hydraulic systems were functioning normally. FDR data showed that in association with the automatic stowage of the left hand wing spoilers, the pre-selected auto brake had not initially produced any braking action and that in the absence of normal hydraulic pressure, subsequent pilot selected braking action had been intermittent, possibly due to a defect within the hydraulic system PTU and/or to the PTU having isolated the left hand brake system because of the loss of all left hand hydraulic system fluid. During the second selection of the thrust reversers, the effect of this system malfunction would have been that the right hand hydraulic system would have fully deployed the right engine reverser but the almost stowed left reverser would have remained in its almost-stowed position so that aircraft speed increased due to thrust from the left engine. The Investigation noted that just over a year earlier, in May 2005, the same aircraft had also overrun the runway during landing at Poznan, Poland “which might be for the same reason” but noted that no response had been received from the Polish authorities in reply to a request for information. The Investigation formally determined that the ‘Main Reason’ for accident overrun was the “late touch down point (on the) down-sloped runway, (the) reduced braking effect and the (unexpected) lateral acceleration
