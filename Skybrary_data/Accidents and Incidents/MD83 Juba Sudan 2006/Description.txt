On 23 June 2006, a Boeing MD83 of Egyptian operator AMC Airlines under wet lease to Sudan Airways on a scheduled passenger flight from Nairobi to Juba overran the 2400 metre long landing runway at destination in normal day visibility. None of the 24 occupants were injured but the aircraft suffered significant damage to the nose and left main landing gear. Minor runway end ground lighting damage was caused by aircraft impact. ATC were not initially aware of the overrun as it was not visible from their position.
