The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was: “the pilots’ failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots’ first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane’s autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing.” It was also concluded that Southwest Airlines had contributed to the accident by: Their failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations. The programming and design of its on board performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision-making. The plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarisation period. The failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties.. It was also concluded that the failure of the flight crew to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking actions and a tailwind component greater than 5 kts had contributed to the accident. And it was additionally that “the absence of an EMAS which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C” had contributed to the severity of the accident.
