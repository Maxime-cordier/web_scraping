The Investigation was carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB). Their Report attributed the control difficulty to an inflation of the tailcone evacuation slide which had occurred during aircraft rotation at take off when the unsecured slide cover had moved and initiated slide inflation. No airworthiness explanation for the unsecured status of the slide container could be established, nor any previous history of related tailcone slide problems on this or any of the Operator’s other similar aircraft. It was noted that the area containing the slide container is a rear emergency cabin exit which can be accessed “from the passenger compartment through the aft bulkhead pressure door and aft accessory compartment” It also noted that the passengers on the flight had included US Secret Service Personnel on duty because of the identity of the primary passenger and stated that: “The results of an internal USSS investigation relating to security sweeps of the incident aircraft revealed that no USSS personnel or USSS support personnel interfered with or altered the aircraft’s hardware or systems relating to the tailcone evacuation slide.”
