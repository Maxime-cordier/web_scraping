dimensions of the obstacle in a difficult environment in terms of lighting. Contributory Factors were identified as: the positioning of the control cabin in the high position. the fact that the de-icing vehicleâ€™s flashing light was not at the highest point on the vehicle, whereas the crew thought this to be the case, leading the pilots to estimate that the wing would not collide with the obstacle. the likely procedural drift represented by the undefined procedure for pre-positioning the de-icing vehicles. incomplete and imprecise documentation on the de-icing zones. the absence of checks on the positioning of vehicles in the procedures for setting up the de-icing areas.
