On 23 February 2019, a Raytheon B200 King Air (N7779V) in US corporate ownership and on a private IFR flight from Saanen to Amsterdam in day VMC experienced a sudden and complete loss of all the flight instrument displays whilst climbing en-route as cleared ten minutes after takeoff. This was interpreted (correctly) as the consequence of a complete electrical failure which the pilot advised to ATC on his personal air band radio with the information that he intended to divert to Lausanne which was subsequently achieved in VMC without further event.
