On 26 December 2016, an Airbus A340-300 (OY-KBC) being repositioned out of service by towing at Copenhagen in normal day (but twilight) visibility was in collision with an Avro RJ100 ( SE-DST) which had just arrived from Gothenburg on a non-revenue positioning flight and which had stopped short of its assigned parking stand to await stand entry guidance. Both aircraft were damaged, the Avro sustaining substantial damage to its empennage and the A340 minor damage to its right wingtip.
