On 12 June 2015, a Nauru Airlines Boeing 737-300 (VH-NLK) being operated on a scheduled international passenger flight from the Marshall Islands to Kosrae and making a non-precision offset approach to runway 05 at destination in night IMC received successive EGPWS terrain proximity alerts. These were initially assessed as false but a go around was eventually commenced due to lack of the visual reference required to commence circling but insufficient thrust was applied and descent to within 200 feet of the sea occurred accompanied by a further EGPWS terrain proximity alert. A climb was then established, the aircraft stabilised and the subsequent approach and landing were uneventful.
