they were overloaded when the trim fault occurred and consequently postponed taking action until a high airspeed had been established - the same response to the fault at a lower airspeed would have reduced the resultant ‘g’ forces.. Safety Action taken during the conduct of the Investigation was noted to have included: the publication by the Operator Jetflite on 12 January 2011 of a Temporary Revision to the QRH dealing with the reduction of airspeed and turning on the seat belt sign when the autopilot is being disengaged in a trim fault situation. This revision also warned pilots of the possibility of insufficient control forces and suggested that the severity of the situation can be estimated from the angle of the horizontal stabiliser.. the publication by aircraft manufacturer Bombardier on 4 November 2011 of an ‘Advisory Wire’ to operators relating to the accident which reminded pilots to firmly grip the control column prior to AP disengagement and, time permitting, to notify the passengers of the situation and turn on the Fasten Seat Belts sign.. action by Jetflite to the enhance the duties of the “service hostess” to embrace responsibilities in respect of the safety of passengers with a corresponding re-designation of the role as “flight attendant”.. Three Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Jetflite ensure that Standard Operating Procedures as well as pre-takeoff checklists support flight crew action when it comes to confirming the critical takeoff-related issues immediately before takeoff.. that Transport Canada review the content of Bombardier CL300-type aircraft QRH checklists as regards horizontal stabilizer trim system faults.. that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) call attention to the content of the type training classroom instruction and simulator training of artificial feel system operating principles, especially with regard to aircraft types in which the system does not directly adjust in relation to airspeed.. The Final Report of the Investigation and an abridged translation of the original Finnish language version was published on 21 May 2013.
