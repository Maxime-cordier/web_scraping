An Investigation was carried out by the French Civil Aviation Accident Investigation Agency, the BEA, using relevant FDR and recorded ATC data. The 2 hour CVR was not isolated after the event and so relevant data was overwritten. The 42 year-old male Training Captain in command had a total of 5,200 hours flying experience of which nearly 1,000 hours were on type. The 32 year-old female First Officer had a total of 3,200 hours flying experience of which over 1,000 hours were on type. For both pilots, the investigated event occurred on their first flight of the day. With the First Officer acting as PF, the flight was cleared for the LOC ‘A’ approach to runway 25 at Le Bourget (MDA 800 feet/MDH 520 feet) which, because of the proximity of the runway to those of Paris CDG, was offset from the runway 25 centreline (249°) by 26° and used a LOC track which led towards the upwind end of the full length of runway 25. The flight had been notified that runway 27 was out of use. Whilst already established on the LOC, several minutes prior to reaching the Final Approach Fix (FAF) and beginning descent from 3000 feet, the PM Captain incorrectly changed his altimeter subscale setting to 1014 hPa rather than to the correct 1004 hPa. Seven minutes later shortly before reaching the procedure FAF, the First Officer set her altimeter subscale by reference to the Captain’s so that thereafter both were indicating 280 feet higher than the actual altitude. The descent was commenced at around 800 fpm, a rate compatible with the airspeed, and the aircraft was configured for landing. Having announced that they had the runway in sight, they were cleared to land and the AP was disengaged at 500 feet agl ( point 1 on the illustration below). Due to the QNH setting error, the altitude being displayed was around 1000 feet but this appeared to go unnoticed. A few seconds later, the PF turned left to line up with a long-disused former runway but after recognising the error at about 250 feet agl then began a corrective turn to the right towards the displaced (by 891 metres) landing threshold of runway 25. At approximately 40 feet agl and approximately 600 metres before the displaced threshold, the aircraft crossed the runway with idle thrust set in a left turn and a 20° bank angle. The recorded angle of attack quickly increased from 9° to 29°, which led to a stall warning and a 6 second activation of the stick shaker. At 20 feet agl and whilst 35 metres to the right of the runway centreline with a 15° left bank, the First Officer abandoned the attempt to touchdown (point 2 on the illustration below) and set maximum thrust to climb away. The left wing leading edge then hit an edge light to the right of the runway before the aircraft began a right turn to regain the runway centreline and climb away (point 3
