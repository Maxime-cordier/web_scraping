On 10 September 2017, a Gulfstream G550 (M-SAWO) being operated by AvconJet on a non scheduled passenger flight from Vienna to Paris Le Bourget failed to correctly make the required transition from the offset non-precision approach to runway 25 at destination to its centreline in day VMC. After the stick shaker was activated during a late attempt to line up for touchdown, a go around, during which the left wing hit and damaged a runway edge light causing minor consequential damage to the aircraft, was initiated. The rest of the go around, re-positioning and the subsequent approach and landing were then completed without further event.
