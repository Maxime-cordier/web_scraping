On 4 February 2020, an Airbus A350-900 (F-HREV) being operated by French Bee with an augmented flight crew on a scheduled international passenger flight from San Francisco to Paris Orly as FBU711 was passing 1,400 feet QNH on an ILS 25 approach at destination in day VMC when an unexpected predictive windshear warning occurred and the Captain ordered a go around in response. After the go around stop altitude was then significantly exceeded and an ATC heading instruction was ignored, the Captain took over and eventually regained control of the aircraft in accordance with ATC instructions and a second approach to the same runway was completed without further event.
