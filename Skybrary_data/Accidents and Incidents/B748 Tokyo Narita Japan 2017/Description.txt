On 15 July 2017, a Boeing 747-8F (N852GT) being operated by Polar Air Cargo Worldwide on a scheduled international cargo flight from Narita to Shanghai Pudong as PO213 only became airborne just before the end of the runway during its night VMC takeoff. The aircraft did not hit any obstructions but came close enough for its jet blast to disable security sensors installed on the extended centreline of the runway.
