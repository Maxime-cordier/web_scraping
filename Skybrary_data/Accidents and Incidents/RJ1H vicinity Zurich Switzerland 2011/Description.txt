On 20 July 2011, an Avro RJ100 being operated by Swiss European Airlines on a positioning flight from Nuremburg to Zurich experienced a near loss of control after their initial response to an unexpected ‘bank angle’ alert whilst on approach at destination. After receiving navigation assistance from ATC pending restoration and use of valid aircraft navigation displays, normal flight path control was regained and a second approach to land was completed uneventfully.
