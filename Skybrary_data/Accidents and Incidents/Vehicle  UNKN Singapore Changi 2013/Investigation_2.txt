associated radio interference but that the radio equipment fitted was fully serviceable. However, it was ascertained that two days earlier, the same friction test vehicle involved had been sent with a different driver to carry out a friction test run at Seletar Aerodrome, located some 8.6nm to the west of Changi. The TWR controller there, where the TWR frequency was 122.9 (compared with the 121.9 being used at Changi at the time of the incident) reported that they had heard ‘disjointed words’ at the time when the friction test vehicle driver had reported transmitting during the incident but had been unable to identify the caller and so had tried - without success - to establish two way contact. It was concluded that this, coupled with the vehicle drivers admission that he had not checked that the correct frequency was selected before beginning to transmit, almost certainly explained the failure to communicate with the TWR - but not entry to the runway without clearance, since such a clearance was still a requirement even with the runway temporarily closed. In seeking some form of ‘explanation’ for the latter non compliance, the Investigation noted that the driver’s motivation to complete the test may have been strengthened by the knowledge that it was a necessary preparation for planned preventive maintenance work scheduled for two days later which included rubber deposit removal from areas on the runway that were to be identified using the results of the friction test. If the test was not completed this time and, for any reason (such as rain) could not be conducted the following day, then the friction test mission would be a failure of some consequence. The Investigation made a number of observations on matters related to their findings including that: the TWR controllers were supposed to alert an aircraft on final approach of any potentially hazardous circumstances (such as unauthorised traffic on the runway) immediately but “instead of according priority to the approaching aircraft by cancelling the landing clearance and explaining the reason, the controller tried to contact (the vehicle) probably in the hope of getting it (off) the runway in time and thus obviating the need to cancel the landing clearance”. Even when cancelling the landing clearance and giving the instruction to go around, no reason was given.. it was not established whether any concerted attempt had been made to visually scan the runway from the TWR cabin before declaring the runway re-opened - or to establish how likely it was that, at the range involved, that such a small object, albeit a moving one, would have been readily detectable anyway.. before clearing the inbound aircraft to land, the controller involved had visually scanned the runway (without spotting the vehicle) but had not checked (and neither was this required in good weather) the A-SMGCS display.. the five minute inspection period was so short that it was probably unsuitable for the additional friction testing task because the time required to complete it was only just within the
