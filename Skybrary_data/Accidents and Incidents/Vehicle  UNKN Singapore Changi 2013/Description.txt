On 4 April 2013, during a brief runway closure for a routine daily inspection by three vehicles, a fourth vehicle entered the runway without ATC awareness in normal daylight visibility and was still there, still without ATC awareness and moving along the runway in the direction opposite to aircraft use, when the runway was re-opened and the first landing clearance was issued. The TWR subsequently observed the vehicle on the runway visually but were unable to make contact with it and the aircraft on approach was instructed to go around when just under 1 nm from touchdown.
