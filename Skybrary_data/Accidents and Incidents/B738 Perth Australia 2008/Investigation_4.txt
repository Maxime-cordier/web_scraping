and e-mail to all appropriate stakeholders. Although the airport operator’s receipt and acknowledgement system was not identified by the investigation as a safety issue, at the time of drafting this report, the airport operator was investigating methods for implementing a more robust verification system. The operator’s aim was to encourage a better response from recipients.. The Airport Operator is in the process of implementing a revised process to manage critical airside works. That revised process will include the establishment of a safety group for each project, who will review the relevant project’s draft MOWP and assess all risks associated with the works and the effectiveness of any safety procedures. In addition, it is intended that during the initial planning stages of any works, the project manager and manager airside safety will determine the necessary restrictions to the works and to aircraft operations, consulting where necessary with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) and with (ANSP) Airservices Australia. The consultation process will include an assessment of the likely impact of the planned works on the airport’s navigational aids and associated published instrument approach procedures.. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority is, in response to the possible safety benefits of the use of the ICAO-recommended 36 metre closed runway markings in Australia when the affected permanent threshold and touchdown markings were not required to be obscured, intending to consult with the industry on a proposal to change to the ICAO system for closed runway markings.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 30 June 2009. No Safety Recommendations were made as a result of it.
