On 5 August 2019, a Cessna 560XLS (D-CAWM) being operated by AeroWest on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Oslo to Aarhus collided with the ILS antenna for runway 28L at Aarhus whilst making an approach to runway 10R in night IMC (although completing it with full visual reference), touched down ahead of the runway threshold partially collapsing the landing gear before ending up on the runway where a fuel-fed fire started. The three crew and 7 passengers evacuated without injury but the aircraft was largely destroyed by impact damage and a subsequent fire and substantial impact damage was caused to the runway 28R localiser antenna.
