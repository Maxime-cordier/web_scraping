the (entirely standard) approach and runway lighting system associated with runway 10R.. A touchdown on soft but solid ground in a landing attitude at low airspeed absorbed most of the impact forces and reduced the risk of serious injuries to passengers and crew.. The Captain’s seniority and experience at the operator might have resulted in the First Officer’s reluctance to effectively monitor the final hazardous stages of the approach by creating a steep authority gradient.. The actual flight and duty time on the day of the accident was within required limitations and flight crew fatigue was not identifiable as a factor in respect of any aspect of what happened.. A combination of lack of visual contact with the aircraft on the runway from both the ATC position and the Aerodrome Office together with the absence of a post crash distress (MAYDAY) call from the aircraft resulted in an extended aerodrome emergency response time.. The Investigation formally identified five Causal Factors which it concluded had led to the accident: An action plan on flying below the GS, performing an approach aimed at touching down on the threshold in dark night and low visibility conditions.. The deactivation of a hardware safety barrier.. Deviations from SOP.. Less than optimum CRM.. Confusion over and a misinterpretation of the CAT 1 approach and runway lighting system of runway 10R.. The Final Report was published on 10 June 2020. No Safety Recommendations were issued.
