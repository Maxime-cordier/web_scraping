On 6 February 1996, a Boeing 757-200 (TC-GEN) being operated by Turkish airline Birgenair was on a scheduled international passenger flight from Puerto Plata to Frankfurt for wholly owned subsidiary Alas Nacionales (National Wings) as ALW311 with an augmented crew with the immediate destination a technical stop at Gander en-route first to Berlin Sch√∂nefeld. Contact with ATC was lost shortly after an apparently normal night VMC takeoff and it was subsequently found to have crashed into the sea at speed less than five minutes later 14nm northeast of the airport, resulting in the destruction of the aircraft and fatal injuries to all 189 occupants.
