(ATS) and 8 (SAR). (SR 58/2013). that the GCAA should require all ATC units be equipped with a dedicated transceiver which can be directly tuned to all frequencies in the aviation band(s) for use in emergency situations. (SR 59/2013). that the GCAA should assist and/or support the provision of mutual radar data sharing between the Bahrain and UAE Flight Information Regions. (SR 60/2013). The National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB) assisted with the Investigation in various ways and in the light of its early findings and those from the 2011 Asiana 747 Freighter fire, the Board commissioned a Fire Safety Study to examine the characteristics of lithium ion battery fires. The resulting NTSB Materials Laboratory Study Report 12-019 completed on 21 March 2012 was used in support of the issue, on 28 November 2012, of three NTSB Safety Recommendations to the FAA on the subject of the fire hazard in cargo aircraft on the following subjects: Early detection of fires originating within cargo containers and pallets (A-12-68). Flammability requirements for cargo container construction materials (A12-69). Active fire suppression systems in all aircraft cargo compartments or containers, or both, such that fires are not allowed to develop (A-12-70). The Final Report of the Investigation was published in 24 July 2013.
