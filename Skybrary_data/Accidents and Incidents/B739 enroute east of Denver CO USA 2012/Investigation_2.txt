increase in pressure altitude and the left angle of attack measurement became different from that of the right by about 0.5°. The FDR continued to record valid altitude and attitude information throughout the remainder of the flight. It was noted that a loss of airspeed information from the left side Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU), which uses data from the pitot head and static ports on the left hand side of the aircraft, would have resulted in an amber flag indicating “IAS DISAGREE” on the left and right primary PFD, as well as an amber flag indicating “SPD” on the left PFD". It was noted that the FDR did not record data from the right ADIRU and the standby system. It was noted that testing of the air data systems following replacement of the left pitot head and system cleaning did not reveal any anomalies that could explain the reported loss of all instrument indications on the Captain's PFD or the reported unreliability of the airspeed and altitude indications on the First Officer's PFD. The Probable Cause of the event was determined as an in-flight collision with a bird during descent to land, which resulted in damage to the left pitot tube and loss of airspeed information to the left and right primary flight displays (PFD). The reason for the total loss of indications on the left PFD could not be determined based on available evidence. The Final Report was adopted on 24 March 2014. No Safety Recommendations were made.
