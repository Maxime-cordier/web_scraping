On 9 September 2007, an MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MD-83 being operated by Austrian Company MAP Jet, which was over the permitted weight for the runway and conditions, made a night take off from Are/Ostersund airport, Sweden, and after failing to get airborne until almost the end of the runway, collided with the approach lights for the opposite runway direction before climbing away and completing the intended flight to Antalya.
