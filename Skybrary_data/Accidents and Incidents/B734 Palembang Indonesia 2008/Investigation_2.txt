293º, resulted in a track which, if followed below MDA, would bring an aircraft to a position approximately 200 metres to the right of the runway centreline at its landing threshold. Such a position would be closer to the taxiway on which the aircraft landed than the runway. However, the published procedure had been subject to calibration 2½ months into the temporary regular use period and found acceptable. The Investigation found that the Causes of the Serious Incident were: Both pilots were concentrating looking inside and not sufficiently cross checking to the outside situation.. There was misalignment of the VOR approach path.. The controller noticed that the aircraft was not aligning with the runway.. According to the ATS procedure, the controller could only command the pilot to go around whenever the runway is unsafe to land.. Safety Action taken or intended by the Palembang Airport Operator Authority as a result of the Incident was noted as follows: Painting black the runway markings currently visible on the taxiway.. Turn on the runway lights and approach lights during aircraft approaches until the Instrument Landing System (ILS) is returned to service.. Informing pilots of approaching aircraft if there are any track deviations noted on the ATC radar during the landing approach.. Speeding up the installation of visual aids on the new section of the runway.. Speeding up the activation of the ILS for runways 29/11.. The Final Report of the Investigation was on 5 November 2011. As a consequence of advice of the Safety Action noted above, no Safety Recommendations were deemed necessary.
