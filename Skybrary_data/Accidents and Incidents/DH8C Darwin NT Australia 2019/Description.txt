On 11 November 2019, a Bombardier DHC8-300 (VH-ZZE) being operated by Surveillance Australia was about to depart Darwin on an offshore surveillance flight in good day visibility but when the power levers were advanced for takeoff against the brakes, there was a loud bang and the power was returned to flight idle. After observing abnormal indications for the right engine, a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW123E, it was shut down and the aircraft taxied to the operatorâ€™s maintenance facility using the serviceable engine. A runway inspection found metallic debris where the aircraft had been standing.
