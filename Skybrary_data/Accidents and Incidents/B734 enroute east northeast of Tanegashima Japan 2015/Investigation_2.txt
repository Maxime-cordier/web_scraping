the 450 ºF limit switch in this system had also malfunctioned leaving the 490 ºF limit switch to close the right side system PRSOV and thereby completely stop the supply of high pressure bleed air to the aircraft cabin. With only inlet fan air at ambient air pressure provided to both Environmental Control System (ECS) Packs, the cabin altitude had then begun to rise quickly. The Investigation found that the pre-cooler control valves and their downstream 450 ºF limit switch in both the left and right side systems had deteriorated to the point of unserviceability. It was noted that a Service Bulletin (SB) with ‘Recommended’ status had been issued nine years earlier after reports of malfunctions in both components which had provided alternatives. The aircraft involved was found not to have received this SB attention. The Investigation determined that the Probable Cause of the loss of pressurisation was caused by the complete stoppage of the system air supply from both bleed air systems when their PRSOVs closed automatically because the bleed air exit temperatures exceeded the allowable maximum. The excessive temperature was reached due to malfunctions in both systems’ Pre-cooler Control Valves with the 490º F maximum only being reached because both systems’ 450º F temperature sensors, which were supposed to control PRSOV function, were also faulty. Safety Action taken by Japan Transocean Air as a result of this event and known to the Investigation was noted as including the implementation of the already available SB to restore reliable function of the cabin air temperature regulation, the addition of a check on the integrity of Pre-cooler Control Valves at ‘C’ Check and regular inspection of the thermostats on the 450º F limit switches every 16,000 flight hours. The Final Report was adopted by the JTSB on 13 October 2017 and published on 26 October 2017. No Safety Recommendations were made.
