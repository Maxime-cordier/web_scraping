On 30 January 2012, an A330-200 (A6-EYE) being operated by Etihad Airways on a scheduled passenger service from Abu Dhabi to Dublin lined up on the edge lights of departure runway 31L instead of the runway centre line in low night visibility and began a take off. After early recognition of the error, take off was rejected and the aircraft stopped after just under 800 metres of ground run. The aircraft was subsequently towed back to the terminal because of annunciation of nose gear tyre deflation and upon arrival there, the 229 uninjured occupants disembarked.
