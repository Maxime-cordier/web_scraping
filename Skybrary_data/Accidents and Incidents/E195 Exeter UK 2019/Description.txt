On 28 February 2019, fumes became apparent in the flight deck and the cabin when thrust was increased for takeoff against the brakes on an Embraer E195 (G-FBEJ) being operated by Flybe on a scheduled international passenger flight from Exeter to Alicante in normal day visibility. When it became apparent that a similar situation existed in the cabin, an emergency evacuation was ordered during which 1 of the 100 passengers sustained a serious injury and one of the cabin crew a minor injury.
