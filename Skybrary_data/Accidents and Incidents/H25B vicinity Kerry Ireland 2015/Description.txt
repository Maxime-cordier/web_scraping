On 16 June 2015, an HS 125-800 (N1310H) being operated by an unidentified US company on a commercial air transport flight from Kerry, Ireland to Gander, Newfoundland, Canada failed to follow its ATC clearance and reported being in level flight below the level of and heading towards surrounding terrain when in day IMC. ATC recognised the resultant imminent risk of CFIT and instructed the crew to commence an immediate climb. As a result, the flight, with 3 passengers on board, completed the reminder of its flight without further event.
