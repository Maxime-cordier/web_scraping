below) as they prioritised their concern about preventing an exceedence of VMO. The Investigation noted the fact that even a Training Captain had failed to follow mandatory procedures covering the takeover of control and the avoidance of control column pitch disconnect and that despite a history of (relatively minor) VMO exceedences, the operator “had not provided pilots with recommended operational procedures in the case of approaching or exceeding VMO”. Relevant FDR data around the time of the upset. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The Probable Cause of the accident was recorded as the aircraft being suddenly shaken which caused the cabin attendant who was walking along the aisle to fall off balance and sustain an injury (with the) upset of the aircraft being due to a sudden change in aircraft attitude because of nose-up pitch input by the flight crew to avoid exceeding the VMO together with the nose-up effects resulting from an increase in the aircraft speed following an encounter with localised changes in the wind velocity. Safety Action taken as a result of this event by Japan Air Commuter was noted to have involved the issue of supplementary “Operating Information” to support “existing procedures” in the event that VMO is approached or exceeded. These included emphasis on the need for a timely selection of a target airspeed which provides a safety margin appropriate to the prevailing flight conditions and the importance of any unavoidable manual intervention in pitch control not exceeding the rate of 2-3° per second as recommended for takeoff rotation. In view of the dual control column input, a reminder that this is “strictly forbidden” and that any transfer of control between pilots must follow SOP was also issued. The Final Report was adopted by the JTSB on 2 July 2021 and published in both English translation and the definitive Japanese version on 29 July 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
