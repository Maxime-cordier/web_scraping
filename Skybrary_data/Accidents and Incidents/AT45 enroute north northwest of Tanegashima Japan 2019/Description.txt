On 12 October 2019, an ATR 42-500 (JA01JC) being operated by Japan Air Commuter on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Kagoshima to Tanegashima in day VMC during which line training was being conducted encountered mild turbulence as it began descent from 11,000 feet with the seat belt signs still off. During a subsequent very brief but severe pitch oscillation, the sole member of cabin crew was thrown off balance and sustained a serious injury which prevented her from continuing her duties and the flight returned to Kagoshima. The upset resulted in a vertical acceleration spike to 3.3g which exceeded the limit load factor.
