the erroneous targeting was the failure to correctly align the platform involved after it had been moved to a new position. It was concluded that the positions where the missile warhead radio fuses were activated relative to the accident aircraft flight path indicate that at least one of the two warheads was able to cause functional damage to the aircraft, most probably the first one. However, this finding was qualified by the remark that “since even very unlikely probabilities have the chance to be materialised in aircraft accidents, we need to wait for the end of the Investigation for the final conclusion”. However, the Investigation considers that “the sequence of events clearly shows the occurrence of a chain of events initiated by a human error”. It has also recognised that “up to this point, some important contributing links in the chain of events ....that if each had not arisen, the aircraft would not have been targeted”, a situation illustrated by the diagram below. After release of a Preliminary Report on 21 January 2020 which confirmed that the loss of control had been due to missile damage, a Factual Report was then published on 11 July 2020 containing a more detailed timeline based on recorded radar and aircraft flight recorder data. These two reports form the basis of this summary. A Final Report was issued 15 March 2021.
