put the flight control system into Alternate Law and thus de-activate high angle-of-attack protection. Corresponding FCOM amendments, a preliminary AFM revision and a QRH amendment were also issued with the caveat that the new procedure is provisional pending a final solution for the problem encountered. Similar action was also taken for the A330/A340.. The EASA issued, on 9 December 2014, an AD to mandate the amended AFM/QRH crew response procedure issued by Airbus and the communication of the information contained to crews prior to their next flight. A similar AD was also issued in respect of the A330/A340.. An Interim Report was published on 17 March 2015. This notes that due to the above Safety Actions, "the BFU has, for the time being, abstained from issuing a Safety Recommendation".
