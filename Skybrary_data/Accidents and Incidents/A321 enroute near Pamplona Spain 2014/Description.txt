On 5 November 2014, an Airbus A321 [D-AIDP] being operated by Lufthansa on a passenger flight from Bilbao to Munich was just reaching the top of climb to cruise at FL310 in day VMC when abnormalities in the airspeed display prompted the crew to disengage the Autopilot. A steep descent which could not initially be stopped by crew input to the flight controls then followed and 4000 feet of altitude was lost before flight path control could be regained, albeit using abnormal flight control inputs. Advice by ACARS from Company Maintenance on simplifying control facilitated the completion of the flight, uneventfully, to destination.
