On 28 May 2006, an Airbus A320 being operated by Vueling on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Barcelona to Santiago de Compostela in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) encountered sudden significant turbulence in the climb through FL325 to cleared level FL370 and was forced down to FL310 before the flight crew regained control. Seven of the 142 occupants, including three of the cabin crew, sustained minor injuries as a result and some superficial internal damage to the aircraft also occurred caused by the impact of an unrestrained cabin service cart.
