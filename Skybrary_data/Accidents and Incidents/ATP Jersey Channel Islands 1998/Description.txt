On 9 May 1998, a BAe ATP being operated by British Regional Airlines on a domestic scheduled passenger flight from Jersey was being pushed back off the gate on departure in normal daylight visibility. The second engine had just stabilised after start and the aircraft had been aligned with the taxiway centreline when the aircraft began to push the tug, the tow bar failed and the aircraft rolled forward and the right hand propeller struck the tug cab. About 90 seconds after the impact, the flight crew noticed a small amount of what was identified as smoke in the flight deck and an emergency evacuation was ordered using the integral air stairs at Door 1L and the emergency slide at Door 2L.
