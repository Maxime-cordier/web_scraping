could not be inspected unless the assembly was dismantled and this was not required, such an inspection was not part of this proactive airworthiness oversight routine. It was also noted that at the time of the event, the fitting lug was not life-limited, its actual service life fleet wide was between eleven and sixteen years and that the same corrosion-induced fatigue failure had been causal in many previous in-service failures. Seven other similar failures resulting in the partial in-flight separation of part or all of Boeing 747 inboard foreflaps were noted to have occurred between 2009 and the failure investigated here. Safety Action taken following this event whilst the Investigation was in progress was noted to have included the issue by Boeing of an Alert SB 747-57A2367 (subsequently mandated as a AD 2021-02-15 by the FAA) requiring replacement of specific parts of the trailing edge flap system at an interval specific to the inboard foreflap outboard fitting of every six years or 5,880 flight cycles. The Final Report was released by the Dutch Safety Board on 24 February 2022. In the light of the manufacturer and regulatory action taken, no Safety Recommendations were deemed necessary.
