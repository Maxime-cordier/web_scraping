On 8 July 2019, a Boeing747F (PH-CKA) being operated by Martinair, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KLM, on an international cargo flight from Johannesburg to Harare, lost a significant part of the foreflap section of the inboard triple slotted trailing edge flap assembly on its right wing during its approach to runway 05 at destination in day VMC. The missing structure was found approximately 5nm from the landing runway threshold in a densely populated urban area and recovered with no resulting personal injury or damage to structures reported. Secondary consequences of the detachment for the aircraft structure included damage to the adjacent mid flap assembly rendering it beyond economic repair and impact damage to both the right hand aft wing and body fairing and to the right aft fuselage. The extent of the missing inboard flap section as discovered on arrival at Harare. [Reproduced from the Official Report]
