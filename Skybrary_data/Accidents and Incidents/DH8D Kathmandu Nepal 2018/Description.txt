On 12 March 2018, a Bombardier DHC8-400 (S2-AGU) being operated by US Bangla Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Dhaka, Bangladesh, to Kathmandu as UBG 211 departed the left side of runway 20 at destination following visibly unstabilised manoeuvring in day VMC after a failed attempt to fly a VOR/DME approach. The aircraft continued through the airport inner perimeter fence, caught fire and was destroyed. Forty-seven of the 67 passengers and all four crew members were fatally injured. The remaining 20 passengers survived, all with serious injuries.
