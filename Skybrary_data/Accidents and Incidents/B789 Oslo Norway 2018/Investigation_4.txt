larger than ‘code C’ a marshaller shall be present to guide the aircraft onto the correct de-icing stand. stipulated that there must always be two de-icing coordinators on duty and that in the event that the A-North and B-North platforms are in simultaneous use, this should be increased to three. for the first time (a matter of concern to the Investigation) issued a SOP for the allocation of de-icing stands to individual aircraft by de-icing co-ordinators.. required that for all aircraft larger than ‘code C’ a marshaller shall be present to guide the aircraft onto the correct de-icing stand.. stipulated that there must always be two de-icing coordinators on duty and that in the event that the A-North and B-North platforms are in simultaneous use, this should be increased to three.. for the first time (a matter of concern to the Investigation) issued a SOP for the allocation of de-icing stands to individual aircraft by de-icing co-ordinators.. Airport Operator Avinor has initiated a revision to the AIP Norway to add information about the maximum wingspan permitted on each de-icing stand and added ground markings to the lead-in lines to all de-icing stands.. Three Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that All Airport Operators of Norwegian Airports review and issue information in AIP Norway for all other airports in Norway, stating limitations relating to what de-icing stands/areas the various aircraft categories can use. [SL No. 2020/12T]. that Avinor, the Oslo Airport operator, in consultation with the relevant handling operators, find suitable technical solutions for Gardermoen to prevent aircraft from being directed to the wrong de-icing stand. [SL No. 2020/13T]. that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) consider requiring large aircraft to be equipped with anti-collision aids for use during taxi. [SL No. 2020/14T]. The Final Report was completed on 29 June 2020.
