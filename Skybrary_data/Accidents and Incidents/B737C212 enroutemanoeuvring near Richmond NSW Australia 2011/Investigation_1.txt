An Investigation was carried out by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). It was established that at the time of the loss of separation between the 737 and parachutists, which had occurred within the Drop Zone, both aircraft were operating in accordance with their respective ATC clearances. It was found that due to good in-flight visibility conditions, the 737 had been able to observe the potential conflict and had begun avoiding action prior to receiving any alert from their controlling ATC frequency. The area north west of Sydney where the conflict occurred is shown on the map below. The civil ACC sector with responsibility for both aircraft when the conflict arose was aware that the C212, at 12000 feet, was ready to commence a drop but both parties were aware that a delay would follow due to an aircraft inbound to Richmond AFB, the base of the drop aircraft and which was also the centre of the 1nm diameter drop zone. However, the 737 had been issued with a SID which would take it overhead Richmond and, upon request to a trainee/OJTI pairing controlling their departure ACC frequency (adjacent to the sector where the loss of prescribed separation would subsequently occur) had had the usual 250 KIAS speed restriction below 10,000 feet within 30nm of Sydney removed whilst also being given a stop altitude of 5000 feet. These controllers were aware that the C212 was at 12000 feet in the vicinity of Richmond but unaware that it had been given a clearance to commence a drop and after failing to obtain guidance on clearance from the adjacent ACC sector working the C212, the trainee and their OJTI decided that a re-clearance of the 737 to 10,000 feet was appropriate. The OJTI stated that neither they nor their trainee were endorsed for the adjacent sector over Richmond and that “they did not have a full understanding of parachute operations at Richmond, or of the implications of these operations for their departures planning.” Although at the time of issue, the re-clearance to climb to 10,000 feet did not infringe the required separation minima of 3nm laterally or 1000 feet vertical, it was issued without any confirmation from the adjacent sector that the C212 would remain at 12000 feet or that a drop clearance from that height would not be issued. A system-implemented handoff of the departing 737 then took place to the adjacent sector working the C212. The controller working that sector advised that they first became aware of this traffic when it was 6.7nm southeast of Richmond and realised that there were insufficient track miles to climb it over the C212. On initial contact with the new ACC sector when climbing through 9200 feet for 10000 feet on a north westerly track a groundspeed of 360 knots and just 5.3nm from the C212, the 737 crew were told to “standby”. The sector controller was trying to establish if the drop which he had already cleared but had been delayed had commenced
