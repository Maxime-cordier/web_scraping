On 5 November 2011, in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), a Boeing 737-700 (VH-VBP) being operated by Virgin Australia on a scheduled passenger flight from Sydney to Cairns and climbing lost separation from an active Drop Zone where a Casa 212 (VH-MQD)being operated on contract to the Royal Australian Air Force by civil operator Military Support Services had just dropped parachutists from 2000 feet above the 737. Both aircraft were on a similar track with the 737 climbing below the C212 at unrestricted high speed. The closest proximity of the 737 to a (free fall) parachutist was approximately 2000 metres at the same level.
