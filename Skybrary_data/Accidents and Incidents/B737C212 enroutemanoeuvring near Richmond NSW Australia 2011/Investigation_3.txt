of the 737’s speed restriction reduced the time and distance available to the Sydney Approach West controller to direct, and the 737 flight crew to implement compromised separation recovery techniques.. Airservices Australia’s recognition of prior learning process and subsequent training did not effectively address the variances between the Sydney Departures South trainee’s skills and knowledge and the role of a Sydney Terminal Control Unit air traffic controller in the operational environment at that time.. No Safety Recommendations were issued but Safety Action taken by ANSP Airservices Australia in response to the two Safety Issues identified was assessed as adequate in one case and adequate subject to completion of proposed action in the other. Additional Safety Action in respect of controller training by Airservices Australia and in respect of parachute dropping procedures by the contracted aircraft operator of the RAAF C212 were also noted. The Final Report was published on 16 December 2013.
