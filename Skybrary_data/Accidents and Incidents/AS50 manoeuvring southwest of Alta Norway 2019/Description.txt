On 31 August 2019, an Airbus AS350 B3 (LN-OFU) being operated by Helitrans on a local sightseeing flight which had departed a festival site at Kvenvikmoen in north Norway was manoeuvring in day VMC at low level five minutes into the flight when control was lost. Terrain impact followed soon afterwards and an intense fire destroyed the wreckage and neither the pilot nor any of the five passengers survived.
