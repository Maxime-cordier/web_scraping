On 23 October 2010, an Embraer 190LR (OH-LKL) being operated by Finnair on a scheduled international passenger flight from Oslo to Helsinki as FIN658M commenced take off from Runway 01L at Oslo in good night visibility when aligned with the runway edge lights instead of the runway centreline lights and then corrected onto the centreline – all without ATC awareness – and completed the takeoff. ATC were subsequently advised that collision with lights may have occurred and damage was then found. After an uneventful flight, it was found that the right engine had been sufficiently damaged by ingestion of broken light debris to require its removal for repair. Debris-caused tyre damage requiring main and nose gear wheel replacement was also found.
