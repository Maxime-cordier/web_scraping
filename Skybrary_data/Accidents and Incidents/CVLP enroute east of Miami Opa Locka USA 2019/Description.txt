On 8 February 2019, a General Dynamics Convair C131 Freighter (N145GT) being operated by Conquest Air on a cargo flight from Nassau to Miami Opa Locka experienced a right engine control malfunction passing 4000 feet on departure from Nassau but after engine power was ‘stabilised’, the intended overwater flight was then continued in day VMC. Subsequently, both engines successively malfunctioned and an emergency declaration and ditching attempt followed which destroyed the aircraft and resulted in the death of one pilot and serious injury to the other. Most of the wreckage sank and was not recovered but the left wing was later washed ashore. The left wing of the aircraft as washed ashore. [Reproduced from the Official Report]
