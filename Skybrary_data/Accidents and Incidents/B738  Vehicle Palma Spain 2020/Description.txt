On 19 July 2020, a Boeing 737-800 (EI-EFJ) being operated by Ryanair on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Palma to Madrid Barajas as RYR81SN was instructed to reject its takeoff soon after beginning the takeoff roll on runway 24R at Palma in normal night visibility after an airport lighting maintenance vehicle called on the TWR frequency to advise that it was also on the runway. A low speed rejected takeoff followed and the vehicle remained well separated from the aircraft which was subsequently able to depart for Madrid.
