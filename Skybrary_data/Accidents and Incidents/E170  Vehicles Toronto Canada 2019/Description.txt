On 28 January 2019, an Embraer 170-200 (C-FEJB) being operated by Sky Regional Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Toronto to Dallas Fort Worth as SKV7665 had been cleared to take off on runway 06L in normal day IMC when a convoy of snow clearance vehicles got lost and crossed a holding point for the same runway. The aircraft was instructed to reject takeoff having reached approximately 110 knots and stopped 60 metres from the lead vehicle which itself had stopped just clear of the actual runway after multiple ATC calls to do so following activation of an automatic incursion alert.
