On 6 December 1999, a Boeing 757-200 being operated by United Airlines failed to follow its taxi-in clearance after a night landing in fog at Providence RI and ended up at the edge of the same runway it had just landed on as a departing FedEx B727-200 passed close overhead. Despite being advised by the 757 that it was uncertain of its position but believed it was on an active runway, the TWR controller then twice cleared a MetroJet Boeing 737-200 to take off on the same runway. The crew of that aircraft declined both clearances pending certainty on the position of the lost 757.
