On 29 September 2017, an Airbus A320 (G-EZOC) being operated by easyJet on a scheduled international passenger flight from Mykonos to Milan Malpensa as EZY2952 was in the cruise at FL 360 in day VMC when smoke and fumes in the flight deck led to a MAYDAY declaration and a diversion to Athens which was accomplished without further event after both pilots had donned oxygen masks and completed the appropriate abnormal procedure. The 192 occupants disembarked normally and the only resulting damage to the aircraft was to part of a static inverter installed below the flight deck.
