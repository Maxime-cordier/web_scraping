aft air seal.. Six Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation: that ICAO should take measures in order for authorities that issue certification directives - the FAA and EASA - to adopt the safety requirements issued by ICAO in Annex 8 concerning safety in large aircraft, so that these are applied during the entire take-off sequence of a flight. [RL 2012: 21 R1]. that the FAA should investigate, in consultation with EASA, the prerequisites for introducing requirements concerning yaw stability in large aircraft in the event of sudden loss of engine thrust below Vmcg under the anticipated operating conditions. [RL 2012: 21 R2]. that the FAA should review and revise processes and permissions issued for the Dabber TIG Weld repair method regarding concerned parts in engines that have FAA type certification. [RL 2012: 21 R3]. that the FAA should improve processes to expedite safety of flight considerations in granting export licenses and waivers so that political sanctions do not unnecessarily delay civil aviation safety investigations concerning aircraft - or parts thereof - which are manufactured in the USA. [RL 2012: 21 R4]. that EASA should investigate, in consultation with the FAA, the prerequisites for introducing requirements concerning yaw stability in large aircraft in the event of sudden loss of engine thrust below Vmcg under the anticipated operating conditions. [RL 2012: 21 R5]. that EASA should ensure that initial and recurrent pilot training includes mandatory rejected takeoff exercises that cover events of a sudden loss of engine thrust below Vmcg. [RL 2012: 21 R6]. The Final Report was published on 28 December 2012
