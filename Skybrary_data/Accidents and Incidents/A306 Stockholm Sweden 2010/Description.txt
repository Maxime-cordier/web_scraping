On 16 January 2010, an Airbus A300-600 being operated by Iran Air on a passenger flight from Stockholm to Teheran departed the left side of take off runway 19R at a low speed during a daylight take off in normal visibility after signs that the left engine, a GE CF6-80C2, had malfunctioned. There was some minor damage to both the aircraft and ground installations but no significant obstacle impact occurred during the excursion. An emergency evacuation of the 172 occupants was not deemed necessary and external stairs were subsequently brought to the aircraft to allow their disembarkation to board ground transport.
