that patches of ice and slush may have been present on a larger section of the runway than stated” given that measurement of friction at Stockholm is only carried out along the runway centreline and approximately 7.5 metres either side of it. In this respect, it was noted that ICAO Annex 14 requires that measurements of runway surface friction should be carried out 3-5 metres either side of the runway centreline and that although the Swedish AIP prescribes that the measuring shall be performed at a distance of 5-10 metres either side of the centreline, the difference from Annex 14 does not appear to be documented or notified. It was found that no Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) or audio alert had been annunciated in respect of the failure until after crew action to shut down the malfunctioning engine had occurred and that neither pilot had, at that stage, any idea what had happened, believing that the aircraft may have collided with something or that an explosive tyre failure might have occurred. It was considered that despite the prompt reaction of the First Officer, who had retarded the thrust levers after just over a second whilst also applying appropriate nosewheel steering inputs and opposite rudder, “the veer left could not be corrected and the aircraft ran off the runway, mainly caused by the forces from the moment in combination with the slippery surface”. It was concluded that “the chances of stopping the continued veer were probably reduced by the fact that the pilots did not apply any differential braking in the opposite direction”. Right engine reverse thrust was not used during the deceleration, but no reason for this was advised to the Investigation. It was found that the Operator’s procedures stated that in the circumstances which prevailed during the investigated event, the Captain should have called “STOP” and immediately taken over control as well as retarding the thrust levers to Ground Idle, disconnecting the A/T, selecting reverse thrust and beginning manual braking with the First Officer monitoring the braking and thrust reverser deployment and acknowledging any audio warnings. The aircraft commander reported that he had received no training for engine loss at low speeds although he knew that there were specifically applicable procedures in the Airbus manuals. The Investigation noted that the general requirements for aircraft controllability of the aircraft during the take-off phase in the case of an engine failure are covered in CS25.143 with “control” defined as meaning that the aircraft may not deviate by more than 30 feet (9.1 metres) from the runway centre line upon a loss of power from the most critical engine. These requirements assume that the aircraft can be stopped/controlled with the combined use of brakes, steering and rudder and (over 80 knots only) reverse thrust although it was noted that there are no specific certification requirements in respect of any aspect of control following a sudden loss of engine power when the speed is below Vmsg is the lowest speed at which
