On 18 January 2006, a Dornier 328 being operated by Austrian-registered airline Euromanx on a scheduled passenger flight from Isle of Man to Manchester avoided Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) during the approach at destination only by response to Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) following failure to capture the Instrument Landing System (ILS) Glideslope and a high rate of descent below it in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC).
