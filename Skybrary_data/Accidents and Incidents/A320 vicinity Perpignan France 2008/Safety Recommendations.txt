In respect of the fact that the accident occurred to a non revenue flight and based upon the initial factual information gathered during the investigation, the following three Safety Recommendations were issued on 23 February 2009 that European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) should: Detail in the EU-OPS the various types of non-revenue flights that an operator from a EU state is authorised to perform.. Require that non-revenue flights be described precisely in the approved parts of the Operations Manual, this description specifically determining their preparation, programme and operational framework as well as the qualifications and training of crews.. As a temporary measure, require that such flights be subject to an authorisation, or a declaration by the operator, on a case-by-case basis.. The BEA also noted the Safety Recommendations made by the UK AAIB following its investigation into a Serious Incident involving temporary loss of control during a similar airworthiness check flight which occurred on 12 January 2009 (see B737, manoeuvring, west of Norwich UK 2009 (LOC HF) ) and expressed support for them. These Recommendations included four to EASA in respect of their guidance for and regulatory oversight of both the airworthiness and aircraft operator processes associated with airworthiness check flights. At the conclusion of the Investigation, the following three further Safety Recommendations were made to EASA that: In liaison with the other regulatory authorities, ensures that, in order to certify the adequacy of an item of equipment in relation to the regulatory requirements as well as to the specifications defined by a manufacturer, the equipment installation conditions during tests performed by equipment manufacturers are representative of those on the aeroplane.. Undertake(s) a safety study with a view to improving the certification standards of warning systems for crews during reconfigurations of flight control systems or the training of crews in identifying these reconfigurations and determining the immediate operational consequences.. In cooperation with manufacturers improve training exercises and techniques relating to approach-to-stall to ensure control of the aeroplane in the pitch axis.. The Final Report of the Investigation was released in September 2010.
