On 27 November 2008, an Airbus A320-200 was being operated by XL Airways Germany on a non revenue flight from Perpignan to Frankfurt during which it was planned to carry out airworthiness system testing in the vicinity of the departure aerodrome before routing to Germany. When it was at 3000 ft in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) before setting out en route, the flight crew attempted a low level check of the angle of attack protection in normal control law during which they lost control of the aircraft which crashed into the sea and was destroyed, killing all 7 occupants.
