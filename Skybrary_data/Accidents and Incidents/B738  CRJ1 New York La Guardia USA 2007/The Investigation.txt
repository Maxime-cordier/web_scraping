An Investigation was carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB). Their Investigation found that the minimum separation recorded between the two aircraft had been 600 feet and that the B738 had crossed the runway threshold some 6 seconds before the CRJ 100 entered the same runway to begin the crossing. It also established that the Ground Controller involved had been under training with a qualified ground controller and had been authorised by the (TWR) local controller “via a conditional clearance, to taxi another aircraft across runway 22 after the aircraft in front of (the Delta B738) had passed taxiway F (the crossing taxiway being used by the Comair CRJ100) on the landing rollout. The (TWR) local controller then coordinated with the TWR Supervisor for the aircraft following the (Delta B738 to be removed from) the landing sequence because of insufficient separation. The ground controller mistakenly believed that (it was the Delta B738 which) was being taken out of the landing sequence and authorised (the CRJ100) to cross runway 22 without coordinating with the TWR local controller as required.”
