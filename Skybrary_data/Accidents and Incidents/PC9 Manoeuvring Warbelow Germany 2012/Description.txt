On 27 September 2012, the two pilot crew of a civil-registered Pilatus PC9/B being operated from Neubrandenburg airport by a private company under contract to the German Federal Armed Forces lost control of their aircraft whilst engaged in facilitation of target practice for ground forces in day VMC when it hit a medium sized bird at high speed and at low level. Control was not regained and the aircraft crashed and was destroyed nearby killing both pilots.
