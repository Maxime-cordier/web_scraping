On 5 January 2014, an Airbus A380-800 (9V-SKE) being operated by Singapore Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from London Heathrow to Singapore and in the cruise at FL370 at night in unrecorded flying conditions experienced a progressive loss of cabin pressurisation accompanied by increasing air noise from door 3L. As the cabin altitude approached 10,000 feet, an emergency descent was initiated and a MAYDAY declared. A diversion was initially planned by turning back to Ashgabat, Turkmenistan but after ATC advised that this airport could not accept an A380, the turn back was continued westwards to Baku, Azerbaijan which was reached without further event.
