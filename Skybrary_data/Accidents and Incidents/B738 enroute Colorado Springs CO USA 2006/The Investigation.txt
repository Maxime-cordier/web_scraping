The device that initiated the fire was sent to National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB) for analysis. The device, “According to a sales brochure, it "generates an intense electrostatic ion wind that charges floating particles in the 'breathing zone.' The particles are substantially repelled away from the wearer, creating an almost particle-free 'exclusion zone' for toxic allergens, smoke, dust, viruses, and bacteria. Perfumes and odours can also be minimized by the ion particle-charging-effect." The Fire and Explosion Specialist's report included the following information: "The unit originally came with a 3.6V CR123A size non-rechargeable lithium primary battery. A kit containing a charger and a rechargeable lithium-ion battery was also available for this unit." Further on, the report included data from EDS analysis of the splatter that was found on the device. It showed the presence of manganese - manganese dioxide is a component of primary (non-rechargeable) lithium batteries. “The specialist's report noted that in testimony given at NTSB public hearings on the hazards associated with primary and secondary lithium batteries, a short circuit was "the most common cause of battery fires. The short circuit can be caused either by design flaws, manufacturing defects or improper packaging and handling. Charging non-rechargeable batteries can result in an internal short that can lead to thermal runaway and battery failure. Batteries are generally not designed to be able to contain catastrophic failures, and when they go into thermal runaway they often explode and expel their contents to the environment potentially causing ignition in areas well beyond the initiating battery cell
