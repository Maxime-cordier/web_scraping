establish the aircraft onto a stable final approach prior to crossing the threshold.. The company's standard operating procedures for stabilized approaches were not followed, and an unstabilised approach was allowed to continue.. The pilot was unable to position the aircraft over the centre of the runway as it settled to land, and the left main landing gear entered the deeper snow at the runway edge, causing the aircraft to veer into the snow bank.. In respect of Risk, it concluded that: If a company's risk mitigation strategy is not implemented in a timely manner, hazards are allowed to persist, increasing the risk of an accident.. If company standard operating procedures do not include criteria and procedures for stabilised approaches, or they are not followed, there is an increased risk of landing accidents.. Operating on a snow-covered runway that does not have markings or devices to allow a pilot to easily identify the runway surface increases the risk of runway excursions.. If the identified risks and mitigation strategies are not communicated to the people exposed to the risks, it is possible they will deem the risk as acceptable to management and continue operations.. In response to the Findings of the Investigation, Transport Canada indicated that in their view, "the issue of rejected approaches may be better addressed through guidance material on pilot decision making and crew resource management" than by means of "further prescriptive regulations" and advised that training standards in respect of Crew Resource Management and Pilot Decision Making (PDM) would be improved, including the inclusion of the TEM model in these standards. The Final Report was authorised for release on 18 December 2013 and officially released on 07 February 2014. No Safety Recommendations were made.
