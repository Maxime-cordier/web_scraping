On 13 February 2019, a Boeing 737-800 (F-GZHM) being operated by Transavia on a scheduled international passenger flight from Lyon Saint-Exup√©ry to Tel Aviv was in the cruise at FL 370 in day VMC when it encountered severe turbulence which the flight crew were not expecting that included a rapid roll to the left which led the Captain to take control and recover manually to wings level. Two unsecured cabin crew and eight unsecured passengers sustained minor injuries which it was possible to respond sufficiently to for a diversion on that account to be unnecessary.
