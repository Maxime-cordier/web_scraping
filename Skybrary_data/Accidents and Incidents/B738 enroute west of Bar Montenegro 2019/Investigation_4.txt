following: The event demonstrated the intrinsic limitation of the procedures concerning unforeseen turbulence. The unpredictability both in terms of the time of the occurrence and strength of the turbulence means that these procedures cannot be applied in a timely or correct manner.. Detection of CAT is not possible with the technology currently installed on aircraft. The development of onboard turbulence detection systems and the transmission of updated weather information to aircraft would both improve present turbulence risk management. The BEA report on a Serious Incident to an Airbus A330 in 2012 illustrates the fact that this need also exists for the management of some convective turbulence.. The only current way of limiting the turbulence injury risk at this time is for passengers to comply with the instructions to keep their seatbelt fastened when they are seated.. The Final Report was made available in both English translation and in the definitive French language version on 21 February 2020 after the French language version was “published” the previous month. No Safety Recommendations were made.
