On 29 February 2016, control of a UAV Navigation (UAVN) 'Atlantic' UAV being operated by the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (Vlaams Instituut voor Technologisch Onderzoek - VITO) on a local "test flight" in the vicinity of the aerodrome at Weelde was lost. Its automatic recovery function failed to work and it departed its intended flight path on a south south-westerly track at 4,000 feet. The UAV maintained this altitude as it crossed Belgium and entered northern France where, when the engine stopped, it glided to a crash-landing sustaining significant damage. En route, it passed near to Brussels where it breached prescribed separation with an aircraft which had just taken off from runway 07.
