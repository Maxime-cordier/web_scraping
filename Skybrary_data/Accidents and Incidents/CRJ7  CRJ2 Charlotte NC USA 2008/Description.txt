On 28 June 2008, a Bombardier CRJ 700 operated by PSA Airlines, during daytime pushback collided with a stationary CRJ 200 of the same company at Douglas International Airport Charlotte, North Carolina. Due to thunderstorm activity in the vicinity of the airport, the ground personnel were not wearing headsets which consequently resulted in inadequate coordination and ultimately in a collision.
