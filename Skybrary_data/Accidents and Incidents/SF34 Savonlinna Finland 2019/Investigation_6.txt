onset, requiring the commencement of rescue actions. The Cockpit Voice Recorder had not recorded anything from the flight in question and the earlier recordings that were retrieved from its memory were of extremely poor quality. The recording quality of the FDR, when compared to modern recorders, was poor. The magnetic tape of the FDR was worn, which caused defects in the recording.. Conclusion: The purpose of flight recorders is to make it easier to investigate accidents and incidents so as to improve safety. Aircraft should carry recorders that meet modern-day recording capacity and reliability requirements. Four Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency explore and instruct how operators’ aviation safety and safety management performance, as criteria, can be used in tendering for air services, taking the EU’s regulations into account. [2019-S54]. that the European Commission see to it that a process is created by which it becomes possible to impartially assess operators’ safety management performance and safety levels in tendering for air services. [2019-S58]. that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ensure that the audits conducted by the EU Member States on operators also cover the practical functioning and performance of safety management systems. [2019-S59]. that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) set a deadline for the use of flight data recorders recording on magnetic tape. [2019-S60]. The Final Report was completed on 10 December 2019.
