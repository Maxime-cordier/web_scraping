On 4 June 2016, an Airbus A320 (TC-ATK) being operated by Atlasjet on a scheduled international passenger flight from Dusseldorf to Istanbul under callsign KKK5LP and cleared to maintain FL370 lost prescribed separation in day VMC against a Boeing 737-800 (TC-JGF) being operated by Turkish Airlines on an international passenger flight from Istanbul to Rome Fiumicino under callsign THY7FX whilst both aircraft were on crossing tracks and the 737 was climbing from FL340 to FL380. Both aircraft received TCAS RAs but only the 737 followed it, the A320 having already begun to deviate from its clearance on receiving a prior TA. The (lateral) Closest Point of Approach (CPA) of 2.75 nm and 575 feet vertically occurred after the RAs had ceased.
