After the classification of the event as a Serious Incident by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) of the Aircraft, Maritime and Railway Accident Investigation Unit Directorate at the Bulgarian Ministry of Transport, Information Technology and Communications, an Investigation Commission was appointed by the Minister. Recorded ATC data from Sofia ACC including Mode ‘S’ downlink data was available to inform the Investigation. Relevant FDR data was available from the THY FDR and corresponding data from the A320 QAR was also available. It was found that the 48 year-old A320 Captain had a total of 9,950 flying hours and the 32 year-old A320 First Officer had a total of 1,200 flying hours. The 62 year-old B737 Captain had a total of 5,421 flying hours with the operator and the 28 year-old B737 First Officer had a total of 756 flying hours with the operator. No aircraft type experience was recorded for any of the pilots. It was established that the airspace where the conflict occurred was close to the FL365/FL370 boundary between two vertically separated air traffic control sectors. The Boeing 737-800 was working the lower of these, the SCU sector, and was on an approximately north westerly track at FL340 but expecting a clearance to climb to FL380 (see the illustration below). The Airbus A320 was working the higher of these, the SCL sector, and on an almost reciprocal, approximately south easterly track level at FL370 such that the two ground tracks were going to cross. The 737 was then instructed to climb from FL340 to FL380 by the SCU sector controller without fully recognising the potential for flight path conflict with the A320 still level at FL 370. The 737 then crossed that level climbing at 600 fpm, although still 14 nm from the approaching A320, and their respective tracks began to slowly diverge. In response to an Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) warning annunciated at both sector positions, the SCU controller instructed the A320 to turn 60° left to which there was no response. Instead, having simultaneously received a TCAS TA on the 737, its crew responded by disconnecting the AP and beginning a slow climb above FL 370 without informing ATC, the latter action being clearly contrary to the universal operating procedures for TCAS II. The SCL controller then instructed the 737 to turn 40° left a few seconds before the A320 received a TCAS ‘LEVEL OFF’ RA which was ignored as the climb continued at an increasing rate. No ATC notification that a TCAS RA had been received was given to ATC. The conflicting ground tracks of the two opposite direction aircraft. [Reproduced from the Official Report] Three seconds later with the two aircraft approximately 8nm apart, the 737 received a ‘CLIMB’ RA to achieve 1500 fpm or more and promptly responded, advising ATC accordingly. The SCU controller repeated his previous left turn instruction despite the notification of an RA. However, in responding correctly to the RA, the 737 climb rate began to exceed the A320
