were advanced initially to 62° PLA and then to maximum and soon afterwards the left turn onto final approach was commenced at a recorded 368 feet agl. Seven seconds after this, the PF passes control to the Training Captain and followed this by repeating that “there was no power from the engines” despite the increase in PLA. Four seconds after this, at a recorded 311 feet agl, a stick shaker activation began and the aircraft banked “abruptly” left and descended rapidly into the terrain below with impact eight seconds after the stick shaker had begun. A post crash fire began and the wreckage was subsequently located in one of the few unpopulated areas, the gorge of the Seti Gandaki River which resulted in no damage to ground structures or injuries to persons on the ground. The location of the accident site in relation to the new and old airports. [Reproduced from the Official Report] It was noted from FDR data that, the flight path of the accident approach and that of another visual approach to the same runway at the new Pokhara airport three days earlier by a different crew, “due to the shortened final approach leg for runway 12” neither of these approaches had met the normal requirement for a visual approach to be stabilised at and below 500 feet agl. One Interim Safety Recommendation was issued as a result of the initial findings of the Investigation as follows: that the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) should conduct a comprehensive study to determine the appropriate flight path that allows the criteria for a stabilised visual approach to be met, taking into consideration the simultaneous operations at both Pokhara airports, before resuming a visual approach to Runway 12 at Pokhara International.. A Preliminary Report on initial progress with the Investigation on which this summary is based was completed on 13 February 2023.
