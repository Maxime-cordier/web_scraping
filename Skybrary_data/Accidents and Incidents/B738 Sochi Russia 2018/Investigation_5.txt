wind shear warning on final approach to land which is evidence that the measures taken to improve flight safety improvement were insufficient.. In violation of the requirements of national document FAP-128 (item 3.117) and recommendations of ICAO Annex 3, Doc 9817 AN/449 Manual on Low-level Wind Shear, when going around after wind shear warnings the crew failed to inform ATC about those warnings which, as they might be the only source of information, are therefore very important from the viewpoint of the provision of flight safety information to other aircraft.. A total of 12 Safety Recommendations were issued at the conclusion of the Investigation as follows: that the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) of the Russian Federation provide airportsâ€™ management, airlines' management, flying and maintenance personnel and ATC personnel with the results of the Boeing 737-800 VQ-BJI accident investigation (in order to) pay special attention to the performance of flight operations in accordance with the AFM and airlines' OM requirements.. that the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) of the Russian Federation consider whether to implement the new methodology for providing flight crew with information on actual runway surface condition information on the basis of the TALPA (Takeoff and Landing Performance Assessment) developed by the Advisory and Rulemaking Committee (ARC) in the form of the Runway Condition Assessment Matrix (RCAM).. that the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) of the Russian Federation given the adverse runway condition after heavy shower precipitation should conduct an evaluation of the conformance of the Sochi aerodrome design documentation to climatic conditions and norms with regard to water drainage, as well as the evaluation of the conformance of the actual runway design to the approved project documentation. This should pay special attention to the runway section between 2230 metres and 2580 metres from the runway 06 threshold.. that the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) of the Russian Federation consider whether to develop a list of runways where an overrun might be hazardous for flight safety and to install for these runways a deceleration system such as Engineered Materials Arresting System (EMAS) or similar.. that the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) of the Russian Federation consider implementing additional (special) requirements and methodologies to require flying personnel to undergo psychological testing in respect of their adaptiveness / maladaptiveness level using qualitative readings (in addition to the quantitative ones) of the personality profile analysis, and to (thereby) detect risk groups which should be subjected to additional testing using non-verbal methodology and, if necessary, relevant corrective measures.. that the Certification Authorities consider whether to update the airworthiness standards for large transport category aircraft with conversion tables for each type of aircraft where a braking parameter will be indicated as a function of runway state, the measured friction coefficient and the type of measuring equipment used.. that UTair, take timely and effective measures within its SMS to provide flight crew with the recorded hazard factors and the measures taken to mitigate the associated risks.. that Airline Executives update their Safety Management Systems having considered the shortcomings revealed
