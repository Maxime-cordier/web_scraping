On 31 July 2008, a Hawker Beechcraft HS 125-800A (N818MV) being operated by East Coast Jets on a non-scheduled passenger flight (81) from Atlantic City NJ to Owatonna attempted a go around after touchdown on a wet runway in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) but was observed to overrun the runway and briefly become airborne before crashing beyond the airport perimeter. The aircraft was completely destroyed as a result of collision with the localiser antenna and subsequent terminal impact and the 2 crew and 6 passengers were killed. There was no post crash fire.
