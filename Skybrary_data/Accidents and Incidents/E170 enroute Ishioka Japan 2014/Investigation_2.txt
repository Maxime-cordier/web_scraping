correlated with the time that the A340, which had remained at 11,000 feet, was turned left towards final approach to runway 22 and thus away from the track which the E170 was continuing to follow as it descended. It was noted that all relevant ATC instructions had taken correct account of the prescribed 5 nm radar separation minimum for aircraft at the same altitude when separated by less than 1000 feet and that the margin beyond this minimum requirement had been significant. The Investigation determined that the Probable Cause of the (crew injury) accident was "the (sudden disturbance to the flight path of the aircraft) which occurred when it encountered strong wake turbulence from the preceding aircraft whilst descending which caused both cabin attendants to fall and sustain injury in the aft galley area". A likely Contributory Factor was identified as "the persistence of the strong wake turbulence that the aircraft encountered for longer than usual because of the stable weather condition with calm wind". The Final Report was adopted by the JTSB on 8 May 2015 and published on 28 May 2015. No Safety Recommendations were made.
