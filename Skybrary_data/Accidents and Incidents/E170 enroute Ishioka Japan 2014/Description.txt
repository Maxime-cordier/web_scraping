On 29 April 2014, an Embraer 170 (JA211J) being operated by J-Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan Air Lines on a scheduled Japan Air Lines domestic passenger flight from Yamagata to Tokyo Haneda as JAL 1252 briefly encountered sudden and unexpected severe air turbulence during descent towards its destination in day VMC. Both members of the cabin crew sustained injury during consequent falls, one a serious injury and the other a minor injury but there were no injuries to any of the 35 passengers and flight to the planned destination was completed without further event.
