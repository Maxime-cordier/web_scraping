that there were detail variations in how UK AIP SID charts included this requirement in respect of whether it was included as a QNH or aal figure. It was considered that it would be possible for pilot whose first language was not English to misinterpret an instruction in the form ‘Initial climb straight ahead to xxx feet’ as meaning that a level off at that altitude was required. It was also considered that an instruction ‘Do not climb above SID levels until instructed by ATC’ was open to interpretation as a need to obtain positive ATC clearance before climbing above any level specified in a SID. Safety Action taken by ANSP NATS since the incident to harmonise London TMA SID instructions in respect of minimum turn altitude to read “no turns below….” was noted. The formal Conclusion of the Investigation was that: “The pilots caused the aircraft to level incorrectly at 800 ft aal because they misinterpreted the information written in the general information section of the departure chart. This information originated from the UK AIP. The pilots’ misinterpretation of the information was reinforced by the previous experience of the crew.” One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Civil Aviation Authority should ensure that the vertical profile information included within the general information section of all SIDs published in the UK AIP is unambiguous and that the wording used is consistent across all UK SIDs.
