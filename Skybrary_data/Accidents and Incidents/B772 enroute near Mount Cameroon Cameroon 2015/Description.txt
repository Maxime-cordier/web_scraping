On 2 May 2015, a Boeing 777-200 (F-GSPG) being operated by Air France on a scheduled 40 minute international passenger flight from Malabo Equatorial Guinea to Douala Cameroon in night IMC by an augmented crew was taken significantly off the flight planned FL090 route to avoid convective weather. An EGPWS PULL UP Warning subsequently occurred when close to 13,202 feet high Mount Cameroon shortly after beginning descent towards destination when 8000 feet below its summit. The 8000 feet emergency climb response resulted in terrain clearance of 2,100 feet. The flight was thereafter completed without further event.
