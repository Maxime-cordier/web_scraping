altitude information, tolerances need to be applied [and] when these tolerances are considered, the 1,200 feet displacement between the aircraft was not adequate to apply vertical separation" and so a loss of prescribed separation had occurred. The Investigation concluded that it was probable that the DHC8 5,000 feet altitude capture "occurred earlier than expected due to the aircraft’s rate of climb being unusually high (with) the selection of normal take-off power on departure (used due to reports of windshear in the area) contributing to this high rate of climb". In respect of the Captain's failure to cross check the successful re-engagement of the AP, it was concluded that it was probable that he had allowed himself to become distracted by the search for the conflicting traffic. The Findings of the Investigation were formally documented as follows: The PF increased the aircraft speed at approximately the same time as the autopilot commenced capturing the selected altitude. This resulted in the autopilot mode changing and influenced the PF’s decision to disconnect the autopilot.. The PF did not engage the autopilot correctly and became distracted before ensuring it was connected, resulting in the aircraft climbing through the assigned level. The PM was also not aware that the autopilot had not been correctly reconnected.. The Safety Message drawn from the Investigation was expressed as the need for flight crews operating in high traffic terminal areas such as Sydney to maintain separation by strictly adhering to air traffic control instructions since, "as highlighted in this occurrence, any deviation has the potential to reduce safety margins". It was considered clear that "during this occurrence, the interactions between the [DHC8 pilots] were not effective in responding [to] and managing the encountered threats" and that this "highlights the importance of effective CRM". The Final Report was published on 24 March 2017. No Safety Recommendations were made.
