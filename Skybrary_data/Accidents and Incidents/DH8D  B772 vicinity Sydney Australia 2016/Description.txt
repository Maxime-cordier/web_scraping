On 9 December 2016, a Bombardier DHC8-400 (VH-LQG) being operated by Sunstate Airlines as QantasLink on a scheduled domestic passenger flight departing Sydney for Tamworth NSW failed to level at its acknowledged cleared altitude of 5,000 feet and subsequently lost separation in day VMC against an inbound Boeing 777-200 being operated by Air New Zealand on a scheduled international passenger flight from Auckland to Sydney. Initial corrective action by the DHC8 crew was triggered by sight of the conflicting traffic and as a result there was no actual risk of collision.
