working Sector L6, the RA changed to 'ADJUST VERTICAL SPEED' (VSI green arc between 0 and 300fpm down). This RA lasted 28 seconds and resulted in the initial climb being stopped a little below FL373. Five seconds before it ceased and 'Clear of Conflict' was annunciated, the Thompson 737-800 at FL380 received a preventive TCAS RA 'MONITOR VERTICAL SPEED' (indicating do not descend). This was followed one second later by a 'CLIMB' RA lasting 4 seconds after which both 737-800s received 'Clear of Conflict' annunciations. The Thompson 737-800 reached FL381 before adjusting back to FL 380. The 'secondary' conflict between the two 737-800s led to an STCA activation in both the L5 and L6 sectors when the two aircraft were 5.1nm apart laterally and 825 feet apart vertically - 3 seconds after the Air Berlin 737-800 had received its 'ADJUST VERTICAL SPEED' RA. This led to the Thompson 737-800 being instructed to "turn immediately onto heading 040°" which was then changed immediately to 030°. This was initiated promptly and a further 10 seconds elapsed before the 5 second TCAS RA sequence occurred. The loss of separation between the EasyJet A319 and the Air Berlin 737-800 occurred simultaneously as it was reduced below 5 nm laterally and 1000 feet altitude difference and occurred 9 seconds after the 737-800 had received the initial 'CLIMB' RA. It lasted 10 seconds. Their Closest Point of Approach (CPA) occurred five seconds after the beginning of the loss of separation period when the aircraft had a lateral separation of 2.6 nm and a vertical separation of 850 feet. The subsequent and consequential loss of separation between the Air Berlin 737-800 and the Thompson 737-800 began 3 seconds after the TCAS 'CLIMB' RA for the former had changed to an 'ADJUST VERTICAL SPEED' RA and lasted 38 seconds. Their CPA occurred when the two aircraft had a lateral separation of 1.5 nm and a vertical separation of 675 feet. Thereafter, the Air Berlin TCAS RA continued for a further 17 seconds with the aircraft diverging. The Investigation found that the L5 Executive Controller who had cleared the EasyJet A319 to climb to FL380 when intending to repeat his original clearance to FL360 had thereby initiated the subsequent losses of separation stated that "during and after the conflict, he did not doubt at any time that he had assigned flight level FL 360 at the time of the second clearance" and that only when he later listened to the R/T recording of his clearances did he realise his error. The L6 Sector controllers had only seen the conflict involving the two 737-800s - the involvement of a third aircraft, the A319, was unknown to them as this flight was not visible on their radar displays. The correct functioning of and response to the two Safety Nets - TCAS ll and STCA - was noted as having resolved the collision risk created by the L5 Executive Controller's inadvertent issue of an incorrect climb clearance and his failure to recognise
