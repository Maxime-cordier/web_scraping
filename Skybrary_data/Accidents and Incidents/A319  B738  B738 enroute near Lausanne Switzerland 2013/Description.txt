The aircraft above, a Boeing 737-800 (D-ABKB) being operated by Air Berlin on a scheduled flight from Nuremberg to Palma de Majorca as BER17Z and level at FL370 received a coordinated TCAS RA to climb which, when actioned, resulted in a further TCAS RA due to conflicting traffic above level at FL 380.
