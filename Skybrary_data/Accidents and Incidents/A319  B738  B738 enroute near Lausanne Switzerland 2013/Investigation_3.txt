it prior to the STCA activation. The Investigation formally determined that the Cause of the Serious Incident was: "A loss of separation between an aircraft cleared in error to flight level FL 380 and an aircraft which was crossing on a perpendicular route at flight level FL 370. The upward avoidance manoeuvre initiated by the latter resulted in a second loss of separation with a third aircraft which was on a route in the opposite direction at flight level FL 380. The Final Report was completed on 27 April 2016, approved by the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board (STSB), which had succeeded the SAIB during the Investigation, on 12 May 2016 and was subsequently published by them. ICAO AIRPROX Category 'B' was assigned based on the risk of collision (this is assessed after taking account of avoiding action(s) which have been taken). No Safety Recommendations were made.
