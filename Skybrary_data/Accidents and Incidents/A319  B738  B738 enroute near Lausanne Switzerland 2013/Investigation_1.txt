An Investigation was commenced by the Swiss Accident Investigation Board (SAIB). Recorded ATC data in the form of R/T and radar recordings and Mode S downlinked data was of critical importance to the investigation. The EasyJet A319 was fitted with TCAS ll v7.1 and the Air Berlin 737-800 was fitted with TCAS ll v7.0. The Thomson 737-800 TCAS ll version was not communicated but since v 7.0 had been mandatory since 2005, it was assumed that at least this version would have been fitted. CVR data from all three aircraft was overwritten and given the availability of Mode S downlink data, it was not necessary to seek access to aircraft FDR data. It was noted that the two conflicts occurred between FL360 and FL380 in Class 'C' airspace. The prevailing weather conditions were excellent, with in-flight visibility of greater than 70 km, and no cloud above 12,600 feet. The airspace involved was that controlled by Geneva ACC Sectors L5 (FL355-FL374) and L6 (FL375 and above) which had been combined until split approximately 20 minutes prior to the occurrence of the investigated event. It was established that all three aircraft were on tracks which would be likely to cross in the vicinity of MOLUS - see the diagram below. The EasyJet A319, heading approximately northwest, had checked in with Sector L5 whilst in the climb to FL350 and the controller advised that he would call back with continued climb clearance. The Air Berlin 737-800, heading approximately southwest had checked in with Sector L5 level at FL370. Meanwhile, the Thompson 737-800 had checked in with Sector L6 level at FL380. Three minutes after it had checked in with Sector L5, the EasyJet A319 was re-cleared to FL360 but the instruction was not read back by its flight crew. Almost immediately, it was then incorrectly (and inadvertently) re-cleared to FL380 and a correct read back followed with the setting of the new level on the selected altitude panel in the aircraft observed by the controller on his radar display shortly afterwards. Approximately one minute after the clearance to FL380 had been given, with the climbing A319 approaching the 737-800 at FL370 a STCA was triggered in Sector L5 and the controller responded by instructing the A319 to maintain FL 360. Three seconds later, a TCAS 'LEVEL OFF' RA was annunciated on the A319 (VSI green arc between 0 and 300fpm down) as it was about to pass FL360 with a 2,200 fpm rate of climb. The flight crew reacted promptly to RA and advised ATC of its occurrence. Having exceeded FL360 by only 150 feet, the aircraft returned to it within approximately thirty seconds with an RA 'Clear of Conflict' annunciation occurring just prior to reaching it. Four seconds after the A319 'LEVEL OFF' RA, a coordinated TCAS 'CLIMB' RA was annunciated on the Air Berlin 737-800 level at FL370 (VSI green arc 1,500-2,000 fpm). The crew responded accordingly but after 10 seconds, having begun to close on the other 737-800 at FL380
