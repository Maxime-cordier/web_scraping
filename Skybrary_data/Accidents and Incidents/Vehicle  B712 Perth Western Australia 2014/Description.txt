On 26 July 2014 a Boeing 717-200 (VH-NXL) being operated by National Jet Systems for QantasLink on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Karratha to Perth made a go around just after touching down on runway 24 at destination in normal daylight ground visibility after the crew saw a vehicle ahead and facing away from them on the runway centreline. The aircraft just cleared the vehicle, whose driver was unaware of the proximity of the aircraft until that point. The subsequent repositioning for a further approach was followed by an uneventful landing.
