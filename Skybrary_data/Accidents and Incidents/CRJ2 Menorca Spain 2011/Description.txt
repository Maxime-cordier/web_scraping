On 9 April 2011, a Bombardier CRJ 200 being operated by Air Nostrum on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Madrid to Menorca was inadvertently landed at destination on closed runway 01L instead of the parallel runway 01R for which landing clearance had been given and acknowledged. Maintenance activity was under way but the personnel involved, who only became aware of the approaching aircraft at the last moment, were not affected. The paved surface used was clear of obstructions, the landing performed was normal and the aircraft was undamaged.
