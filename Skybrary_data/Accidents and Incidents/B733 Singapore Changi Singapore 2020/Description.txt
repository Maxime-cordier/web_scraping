On 28 November 2020, a Boeing 737-300F (PK-YGW) being operated by TRI MG Intra Asia Airlines on an international cargo flight from Singapore Changi to Jakarta Halim as TMG019 with an augmented crew was taxiing for departure when it crossed an illuminated red stop bar onto the active runway in normal day visibility. This triggered an alert to the controller who then instructed the aircraft to exit the runway as another aircraft was on approach to land. The subsequent departure was in accordance with further clearances and without further event.
