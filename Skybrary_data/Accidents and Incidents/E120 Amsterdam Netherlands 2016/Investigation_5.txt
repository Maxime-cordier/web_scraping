lighting on taxiway S5 was not compliant with the corresponding EASA specifications.. the issue of an ATC takeoff clearance during the turn onto S5 and the subsequent issue of a departure heading as the aircraft turned onto Runway 24 might have distracted the crew.. The ANSP LVNL was already aware of the operational risks associated with intersection takeoffs before the investigated event had occurred but had not taken any operational measures to mitigate those risks.. The ANSP LVNL continued to identify intersection S5 as a recommended intersection at night despite the fact that the intersection did not have centre line lighting and did not consider the question of whether intersection S5 was justifiably designated as a ‘recommended intersection’ in the Operations Manual and if offering the intersection concerned was a wise choice. It also did not reconsider its position after the decision was taken not to install centre line lights on intersection S5.. Three Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) initiates the process to develop a Standard for runway edge lights in Annex 14 Volume 1 ‘Aerodrome Design and Operations’ that would allow pilots to identify them directly without reference to other lights or other airfield features.. that the Amsterdam Airport Operator proactively takes measures, in line with the above recommendation to ICAO, which prevent pilots from interpreting the runway edge lights as the runway centre line lights.. that LVNL (the Netherlands ANSP) only allows air traffic access to the runway for takeoff using intersections outside of the uniform daylight period when such intersections are equipped with centreline lighting.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 2 November 2018.
