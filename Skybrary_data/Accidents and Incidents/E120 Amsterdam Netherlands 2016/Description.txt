On 18 January 2016, an Embraer 120 (EC-JBD) being operated by Swiftair on an international scheduled cargo flight from Amsterdam to London Stansted was found, after completion of its flight, to have damage to both the right propeller and the right side of the fuselage with this damage considered indicative of a runway edge takeoff that had been made in night VMC. Damage to both nose wheel tyres and to a number of runway edge lights was subsequently found. The crew stated that they had been unaware of their error.
