QNH. The T1W controller then instructed the Embraer 145 to stop descent at FL 070 and when the crew reported they were just reaching it, he instructed them to reduce speed to 210 knots. Shortly after this, the T1W controller asked the F25W controller to instruct the A320 to increase its rate of descent (which he subsequently did) and then instructed the Embraer 145 to immediately turn right (the long way round) onto radar heading 070°.The crew asked for this instruction to be repeated and the controller then instructed them to turn immediately left onto heading 070°. By this time, the crew reported having the potentially conflicting A320 ahead in sight and, both being “uncomfortable” with the controllers instruction which seemed likely to reduce rather than increase separation, they again requested confirmation that a left turn was required and when this was given, they began the turn only to stop it when a further requested confirmation of the turn instruction was followed by “maintain current heading”. Both aircraft were now converging on almost the same position with the Embraer 145 level at FL 070 and approaching the A320 as it crossed in front of them at FL 070 having not yet begun descent from that level as cleared. Shortly afterwards, the A320 reported a TCAS RA ‘DESCEND’ to the F25W controller at which point it was 0.9 nm away from the Embraer 145 and 200 feet below it. Six seconds later, when the Embraer 145 was instructed to turn into heading 060°, its crew acknowledged having also received a TCAS RA ‘DESCEND’ adding that they now had visual contact with the traffic. This exchange occurred at the closest point of approach with the two aircraft 0.8 nm apart as the A320 descended through FL 068 and the Embraer 145 remained level at FL 070. The sector T1W controller subsequently stated that his actions had been founded on a potential conflict between the Embraer 145 and a third aircraft approaching the Transition from the west. He decided to avoid this problem by instructing the Embraer 145 to fly directly to waypoint 435 and descend to 6000 feet, since the A320 from the north was descending to 5000 feet at a normal rate of descent. However, having transferred the A320 to the F25W sector, he realised that it had reduced its rate of descent after being instructed to reduce speed so he had instructed the Embraer 145 to stop its descent at FL070, thinking that the vertical separation would be sufficient. When it became clear that it would not be, he had “instructed the Embraer 145 to conduct an evasive manoeuvre by turning left to heading 070 but it reacted late and requested confirmation of the left turn”. He stated that it was this crew’s delay in turning left that had led to the prescribed minimum separation being breached. Having examined the available evidence, the Investigation observed, in summary, as follows: The Embraer 145 crew did not read back the second part
