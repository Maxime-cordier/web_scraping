of their clearance to fly direct to waypoint BL443 which was to “continue with the Transition”. Since this omission was not challenged by the T1W controller, it was not known whether the crew had registered this part of the instruction.. The T1W controller’s subsequent instruction to the Embraer 145 to fly direct to waypoint 435 was not agreed with the controller of the F25W sector which was in direct conflict with the related handover requirement to this effect which was included in the ANSP’s Barcelona OM.. The formal determination of the Cause of the loss of separation between the two aircraft was “improper planning and execution of the approach sequence by the controller in sector T1W”. Two Contributory Factors were also identified: The sector T1W controller did not correct an incomplete acknowledgment by the crew of AEH993F to fly a Transition.. The sector T1W controller did not coordinate with the final sector (F25W) before instructing AEH993F to fly direct to point BL435.. Safety Action taken by the ENAIRE, the ANSP, was noted as having been to recommend that their internal investigation report on the event should be sent to the Barcelona TMA Training Department for potential inclusion in their annual “Review of Regulatory and Technical Changes” and that this had been approved and the next one would be held in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Final Report of the Investigation was approved on 29 April 2020. No Safety Recommendations were made on the basis that the action intended to be taken by the ANSP Training Department was “deemed to be adequate”.
