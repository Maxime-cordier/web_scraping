Once notified of the event, an Investigation was commenced by the Spanish Commission for the Investigation of Accidents and Incidents (CIAIAC). Due to a delay in the reporting of the event to the Commission, relevant data from both the CVR and the DFDR had been overwritten. However, relevant data from both aircraft QARs were available to the Investigation as were relevant recorded ATC radar and voice communications data. The 49 year-old A320 Captain had a total of 11,786 hours flying experience of which 10,259 hours had been on type and his 23 year-old First Officer had a total of 815 hours flying experience all but 165 hours of which had been on type. The 32 year-old Embraer 145 Captain had a total of 2,493 hours flying experience of which 1,193 hours had been on type and his 28 year-old First Officer had a total of 3,928 hours flying experience of which 177 hours had been on type. The 50 year-old Barcelona ACC sector Executive Controller involved had held a licence for 19 years and had gained all of his subsequent experience there. The 53 year-old Planning Controller had held a licence for 30 years and had also gained all of his subsequent experience at the unit. The A320 was cleared for a PUMAL 1L STAR to be followed by the CLE1W Transition to an approach to runway 25R and the Embraer 145 was cleared for an ALBER1W STAR to be followed by the same Transition to a runway 25R approach. Initially, both aircraft had been instructed to descend to FL 100 by the sector T1W controller. Then, ten minutes prior to the eventual conflict, the same controller cleared the A320 to fly in an approximately southerly direction direct to waypoint BL443 (see the illustration below) and on receipt of the readback then instructed the Embraer 145 to also fly direct to waypoint BL443 (an approximately south southwesterly track) and then follow the Transition but its crew only read back the first part of this instruction and omitted mention of being also cleared to continue on the Transition. The controller then instructed the A320 to descend to 5000 feet QNH and, on receipt of this readback, then cleared the Embraer 145 to descend to FL 080 (also read back correctly) and then the A320 to reduce speed to 250 knots. The chart which included the CLE1W Transition which both aircraft were being positioned for with waypoints BL443, BL439 and BL435 within the yellow circle. [Reproduced from the Official Report] With three minutes to go before the conflict, the T1W controller then instructed the Embraer 145 to descend to 6000 feet and then added that they should fly direct to waypoint BL435, both these clearances being correctly read back. Half a minute later, he instructed the A320 to reduce to “minimum clean approach speed” and transferred it to the sector F25W frequency. When the flight checked in with the F25W controller, that controller then instructed it to continue descent to 2,300 feet
