On 6 August 2021, an Airbus A319 (G-DBCF) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Edinburgh to London Heathrow as BA1441 in unrecorded day meteorological conditions lost both FDs and the FMA (Flight Mode Annunciator), both the AP and A/THR as it climbed through FL340. The aircraft was levelled at FL 350 and significant IRS position inconsistencies were observed so a precautionary PAN was declared. The intended flight was completed but the approach at destination had to be conducted manually. There were no consequences for the 101 passengers.
