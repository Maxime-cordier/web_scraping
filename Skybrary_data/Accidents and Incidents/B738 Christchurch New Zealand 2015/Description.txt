On 11 May 2015, a Boeing 737-800 (VH-VOP) being operated by Virgin Australia on a scheduled international passenger flight from Sydney to Christchurch using callsign Velocity134 failed to decelerate as expected on destination landing runway 29 after making a night visual approach as cleared. It was only just possible to stop the aircraft before the end of runway which, due to work in progress on the main runway, was shorter and was reported by the crew as having been wet rather than, as they had assumed, damp.
