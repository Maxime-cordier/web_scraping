On 5 September, an Irish-operated Boeing 737-800 (EI-FIH) on a scheduled passenger flight from Lille to Porto was on a non-precision approach to destination in VMC at night when the performance of one the pilots was briefly compromised by the effects of flash blindness after a powerful laser was directed at the aircraft. The approach became unstable and a go around to an uneventful further approach and landing followed.
