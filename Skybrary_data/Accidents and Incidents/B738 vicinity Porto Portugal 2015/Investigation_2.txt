considered to be related to the height of an aircraft above terrain at or soon after the exposure, so that in the investigated case, the actual direct risk to safe flight was low and its indirect consequences - an unstabilised approach - could be dealt with by going around in accordance with SOP. It was found that in the US, the malicious use of hand held lasers against aircraft appears to have evolved from mixed use of red and green lasers to almost all green ones, the latter being likely to appear up to 35 times brighter than red ones of the same power. It was also noted that FAA studies have shown that "the adverse visual effects from laser exposure are especially debilitating when the eyes are adapted to the low-light level of a cockpit at night (dark-adapted)" which was considered to be of significance since the typical wavelength of most green lasers - 532 nanometres (nm) - is very close to peak eye sensitivity when dark-adapted (see the diagram below). The legislative situation in respect of malicious use of lasers against aircraft was noted to differ according to jurisdiction whereas ICAO Annex 11 requires that "adequate steps shall be taken to prevent emission of laser beams from adversely affecting flight operations". The Probable Cause of this Serious Incident was identified as "laser illumination of the aircraft cockpit area that caused temporary flashblindness to a flight crew member during a critical phase of flight". Safety Action taken by the Aircraft Operator as a result of this event and known to the Investigation included the provision of enhanced Operations Manual guidance to pilots in the event of their encountering laser beams in the vicinity of their aircraft. One Safety Recommendation was made as follows: that the Portuguese Civil Aviation Authority (ANAC) should review the current civil aviation legislation with a view to taking account of occurrences of deliberate or reckless illumination of aircraft, or persons involved in the operation of aircraft, by laser light or similar.
