The NTSB determined the following probable cause and contributory factors to the accident: "The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the flight crew to execute a missed approach when visual cues for the runway were not distinct and identifiable.". Contributing to the accident were: "the crew’s decision to descend to the instrument landing system decision height instead of the localizer (glideslope out) minimum descent altitude;. the first officer’s long landing on a short contaminated runway and the crew’s failure to use reverse thrust and braking to their maximum effectiveness;. the captain’s fatigue, which affected his ability to effectively plan for and monitor the approach and landing; and. Shuttle America’s failure to administer an attendance policy that permitted flight crewmembers to call in as fatigued without fear of reprisals.".
