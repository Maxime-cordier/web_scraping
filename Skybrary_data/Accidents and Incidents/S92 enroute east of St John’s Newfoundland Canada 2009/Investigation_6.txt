and CARs subpart 704 commuter pilots. [A09-02]. At the publication of the Final Report: that the Federal Aviation Administration, Transport Canada and the European Aviation Safety Agency remove the "extremely remote" provision from the rule requiring 30 minutes of safe operation following the loss of main gearbox lubricant for all newly constructed Category ‘A’ transport helicopters and, after a phase-in period, for all existing ones. [A11-01]. that the Federal Aviation Administration assess the adequacy of the 30 minute main gearbox run dry requirement for Category ‘A’; transport helicopters. [A11-02]. that Transport Canada prohibit commercial operation of Category ‘A’ transport helicopters over water when the sea state will not permit safe ditching and successful evacuation. [A11-03]. that Transport Canada require that supplemental underwater breathing apparatus be mandatory for all occupants of helicopters involved in overwater flights who are required to wear a Passenger Transportation Suit System. [A11-04]. Four Safety Issues were also formally identified by the Investigation as: Category A rotorcraft certified under the “extremely remote” criteria. may not be capable of continued operation for 30 minutes with only residual main gear box lubrication. Given today’s operating environments, it may now be technically. feasible and economically justifiable to produce a helicopter that can operate in excess of 30 minutes following a massive loss of main gear box lubricant. Helicopter crews and passengers in Canada remain at risk where. helicopters are operated over sea states exceeding the capability of their Emergency Flotation Systems. Without a supplemental breathing system, occupants have very little. time to egress from a submerged or capsized helicopter before breaking their breath-holds in cold water. The Final Report was authorised for release on 29 December 2010.
