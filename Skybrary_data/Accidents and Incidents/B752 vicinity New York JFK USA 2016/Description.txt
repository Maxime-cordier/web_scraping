On 7 July 2016, a Boeing 757-200 (N706TW) being operated by Delta Air Lines on a domestic passenger flight from New York JFK to San Diego had just taken off from JFK in day VMC when a right engine fire warning prompted the shutdown of the PW2037 engine and a declaration of emergency to ATC with the aircraft still below 1000 feet. The warning ceased after the engine was shut down and a return to the departure airport was then made without further event with normal passenger disembarkation following after airport RFFS units found no signs of an active fire. There were no injuries to the 157 occupants but post flight inspection showed that the fire had damaged external components on the right engine and had burned through the right nacelle inboard core cowl (see the illustration below).
