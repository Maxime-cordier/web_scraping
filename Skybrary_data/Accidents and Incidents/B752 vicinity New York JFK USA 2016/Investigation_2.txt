used by the Technician who had carried out the work were examined and it was found that they: did not contain an instruction to lubricate the tube O-rings prior to installation.. incorrectly stated that the ‘fuel IN’ and ‘fuel OUT’ tube O-rings should be installed on the FFT rather than into the fuel tube O-ring glands.. did not specify a torque value for the tube attachment bolts.. These instructions were found to be “directly aligned” with the relevant guidance in the AMM. However, it was noted the component OEM, Parker Hannifin, did have extant guidance on FFT installation which stated that "use of a suitable grease or oil during assembly helps protect the O-ring from damage by abrasion, pinching, or cutting" and "helps the O-ring to seat properly". The formal determination of Probable Cause was “maintenance personnel's failure to ensure proper installation of a fuel tube O-ring, which resulted in an undercowl engine fire during initial climb”. The Final Report was published on 19 July 2018. No Safety Recommendations were made.
