of RAP on final approach for runway 14 - these airports have similar runway alignment and can be mistaken for one another". It was noted that a previous similar event, not investigated by the NTSB, had occurred in 2004 when a Northwest Airlines Airbus A319 also landed at Ellsworth instead of Rapid City. Wrong Airport landings at other locations in the USA were noted as not uncommon and as including events involving civil air transport flights on a regular although not frequent basis - for example the visual approach to a landing at an airport 6 miles north of its intended destination, Branson MO, by a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700 in 2014.This Investigation led to Safety Recommendation 15-09 to the FAA to “amend air traffic control procedures so that controllers withhold landing clearance until the aircraft has passed all other airports that may be confused with the destination airport”. As of the publication of the Rapid City Investigation Final Report, this Recommendation remains classified as “Open - Unacceptable Response”. The Branson Investigation was noted during the Rapid City work as having also resulted in Safety Recommendation 15-10 to the FAA to "Modify the minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) software to apply the MSAW parameters for the flight plan destination airport to touchdown, rather than automatically reassigning the flight to another airport based on an observed (and possibly incorrect) trajectory". The basis for this recommendation was noted as having been that “ATC radar data processing systems typically include MSAW functions that compare the aircraft's expected trajectory with its observed trajectory and alert controllers if the aircraft is in danger of collision with terrain or obstructions”. Since this “is accomplished by comparing the aircraft's altitude against a digital terrain model until it reaches the vicinity of the destination airport when the processing changes to compare the aircraft's observed trajectory against expected trajectories for landing aircraft”, it was considered that MSAW systems should be configured to detect when an aircraft is “unexpectedly descending to the ground away from the destination airport” and then generate an MSAW alert. In this respect, “a review of the Ellsworth radar data showed that as DAL2845 approached the Ellsworth area, the system applied MSAW rules for Ellsworth arrivals instead of Rapid City arrivals” so that no MSAW alert was generated. It was noted that the FAA response to this Recommendation was, at the time of completion of the Rapid City Investigation, classified as "Open – Acceptable Alternate Response” on the grounds that, although the FAA did not concur with the recommendation because “the current design of the MSAW tool does not contain any element to address it”, they did “plan to investigate other possible software solutions aside from MSAW” that would satisfy this Recommendation. The Investigation found that the Probable Cause of the event was "the flight crew's misidentification of the desired landing runway due to excess altitude requiring an extended downwind, and failure to use all available navigation information”. The Final Report of the Investigation was adopted
