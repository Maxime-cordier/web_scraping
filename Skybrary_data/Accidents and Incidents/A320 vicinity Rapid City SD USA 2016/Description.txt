On 7 July 2016, an Airbus A320 (N333NW) being operated by Delta Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Minneapolis St. Paul MN to Rapid City SD as DAL 2845 was cleared for a visual approach to runway 14 at destination in day VMC but instead landed uneventfully on runway 13 at Ellsworth AFB which was located 6 miles northwest of the intended destination and was open at the time and had no conflicting traffic. Only when they were about to touch down did either pilot realise their error.
