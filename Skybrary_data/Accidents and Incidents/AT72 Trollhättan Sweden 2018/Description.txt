On 9 October 2018, an ATR 72-200 (YL-RAI) being operated by RAF-AVIA on an international cargo flight from Stettin to Trollh√§ttan, which was a line training sector for the left seat pilot, briefly left the runway during landing in night VMC at destination before regaining it undamaged and completing the landing without further event. The excursion was not reported to anyone by the crew and was not otherwise detected until evidence of it, including damage to a runway edge light, was discovered two days later, prompting further local investigation.
