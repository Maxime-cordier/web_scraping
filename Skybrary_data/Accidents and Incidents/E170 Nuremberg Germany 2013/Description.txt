On 13 March 2013, an Embraer ERJ170-100LR, being operated by Air France subsidiary RÃ©gional into Nuremberg, had just arrived on its gate in normal daylight ground visibility when a routinely connected GPU immediately disconnected and smoke became evident. A precautionary rapid disembarkation of the 77 passengers was accomplished. Minor damage was caused to the aircraft.
