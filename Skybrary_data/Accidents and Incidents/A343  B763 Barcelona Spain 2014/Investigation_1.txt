An Investigation was carried out by the Spanish Civil Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC). By the time the event was reported, "it was no longer possible to obtain information from the Flight Data Recorder (FDR)/Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) of either aircraft". However all relevant ATC recordings were available and were considered sufficient. Both the aircraft involved were carrying augmented flight crews. The A340 crew was under the command of a 52 year old Captain with 17,376 hours total flying experience which included 966 hours on type. The 38 year old First Officer had 3,831 hours total flying experience which included 885 hours on type. The other two pilots were a 34 year old with 4,787 hours total flying experience which included 2,766 hours on type and a 43 year old with 5,560 hours total flying experience which included 1,163 hours on type. The 767 crew was under the command of a 49 year old Captain with 13,500 hours total flying experience which included 4163 hours on type of which 1,977 had been as Captain. The 55 year old First Officer had 9,938 hours total flying experience which included 3274 hours on type. The other two pilots were a 52 year old with 5,756 hours total flying experience which included 4,125 hours on type and a 42 year old with 2,173 hours total flying experience, all on type. The five controllers on duty at the time were all Spanish native speakers and were as follows: a 55 year old Supervisor located in the Main (East) TWR; she had 22 years experience including 10 at Barcelona and a valid level 4 English language proficiency. a 44 year old TWR controller in the Main (East) TWR; he had 14 years experience including 4 at Barcelona TWR and a valid level 5 English language proficiency. a 38 year old Central GND controller located in South TWR; he had 5 years experience all at Barcelona and a valid level 5 English language proficiency. a 37 year old South GND controller located in the Main(East) TWR; she had 7 years experience including 3Â½ years at Barcelona and a valid level 5 English language proficiency. a 37 year old North GND controller located in the South TWR; she had 5 years experience, all at Barcelona and a valid level 5 English language proficiency. It was established that preparations were being made for the routine 0700L runway configuration change from 'night' to 'day' operations required to mitigate noise over sensitive areas around the airport. The A340 was usually an evening rather than an early morning departure but it was delayed inbound. It was initially cleared to taxi to runway 07L, an exception to the usual use of runway 07R for night departures due to the need for longer TODA of 07R. With the First Officer as PF, they began to taxi as shown on the diagram below. Then, when on taxiway 'D', ATC GND advised that take off would be on the opposite direction 25R (since
