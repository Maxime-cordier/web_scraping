On 4 November 2013, a Douglas DC3-C (C-GWIR) being operated by Buffalo Airways on a scheduled passenger flight from Yellowknife to Hay River as BFL168 had just taken off in day VMC when the right engine caught fire. The crew shut down the engine and attempted to return to the aerodrome but the aircraft struck trees and crash landed south of the intended landing runway. The fuselage of the aircraft was not seriously damaged by the impact and there was no fire. All 24 occupants were uninjured and completed a successful emergency evacuation.
