On 2 May 2016, a Boeing 737-800, (TC-JFY) being operated by THY Turkish Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Istanbul to Pristina as THY97A did not touch down until almost the middle of the destination landing runway after an approach conducted in night VMC. As the end of the runway neared, the aircraft was intentionally steered off the side of the runway onto soft ground and eventually came to a stop. The left engine and both main landing gear assemblies were damaged but there were no injuries to the 157 occupants.
