On 20 August 2011, a RAF Aerobatic Team (RAFAT) BAE Hawk T Mk1 (XX179) manoeuvring for landing at Bournemouth after participating in a nearby display under call sign Red4 failed to complete a high speed low altitude turn in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) and lost height before impacting the ground. There was no post crash fire but the aircraft was destroyed by the impact and the pilot fatally injured.
