The National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB) carried out the Accident Investigation. Their Final Report stated that the aircraft had been released to service with an extant Acceptable Deferred Defect stating that the LH engine thrust reverser was inoperative. In accordance with Minimum Equipment List (MEL) requirements, it had been mechanically locked in the stowed position by maintenance personnel and a placard advising the inoperative status of subject reverser placed in the flight deck adjacent to the LH engine thrust lever. It was further established by the investigation that, contrary to applicable SOPs for an inoperative thrust reverser, the aircraft commander, as PF had after touch down initially moved both thrust levers into the reverse position. When the aircraft began yawing to the right, he responded by moving the LH thrust lever out of reverse to the extent that it reached the TOGA position. With the normally-functioning RH engine thrust lever remaining in the full reverse position, the resultant thrust asymmetry greatly increased the right yaw effect and crew rudder and brake inputs did not adequately compensate so that the aircraft left the paved surface of the runway. The Investigation concluded that the probable cause(s) of the occurrence was “the captain's failure to maintain directional control and his inadvertent application of asymmetrical engine thrust while attempting to move the LH thrust lever out of reverse” and also noted that “a factor in the accident was the crew's inadequate coordination and crew resource management”.
