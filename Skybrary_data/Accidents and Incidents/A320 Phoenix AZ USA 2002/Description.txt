On 28 August 2002, an Airbus A320-200 being operated by America West had touched down in daylight at Phoenix following the completion of an uneventful scheduled service passenger flight when asymmetrical thrust prevented the flight crew from maintaining directional control of the aircraft which veered off the runway. The collapse of the nose landing gear and substantial damage to the forward fuselage followed but only one of the 159 occupants was seriously injured with 9 others receiving minor injuries.
