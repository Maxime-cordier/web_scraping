On 13 January 2017, a Boeing 747-8F (VQ-BLR) being operated by ABC Cargo Airlines on an international cargo flight from Novosibirsk to Amsterdam made an initial main gear touchdown just prior to the beginning of the landing runway at destination in night VMC. The crew stated that they were unaware of this until maintenance personnel who attended the aircraft on stand reported multiple scratches and dents on the wings and fuselage.
