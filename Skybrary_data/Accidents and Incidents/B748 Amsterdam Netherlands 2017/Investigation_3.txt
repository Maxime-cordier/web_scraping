TDZ and visual illusions. This was followed by eight sectors’ line training and completion of a line check. Also, all the Operator’s pilots were alerted to the importance of following the ILS GS until landing and of initiating a go-around at any time an approach becomes unstable. The Conclusion of the Investigation was formally documented as follows: The hard landing was caused by a high rate of descent. The flare manoeuvre was insufficient to reduce the sink rate satisfactorily. The fact that the aircraft hit the runway threshold lights was a combination of the continued flight below the glideslope, from the moment the Captain disconnected the autopilot at 700 feet and took over the controls manually, and a high sink rate shortly before the touchdown. The approach was stable until just before the landing, but then two automatic EGPWS alerts were generated (“glideslope” and “sink rate”) whereby the stable approach criteria were exceeded. This should have been followed by a go-around but this did not happen even though the procedures required it. According to the Operations Manual of the ANSP, ATIS messages should include any reported windshear conditions. Flight crews are thereby made more aware of sudden wind changes and the necessity to make a go-around in case the approach becomes unstable. The ANSP, LVNL, has not been able to demonstrate that the windshear conditions reported by aircraft crews resulted in the ATIS being modified. The measures taken by the aircraft operator after the event are necessary to avoid occurrences like hard landings as well as landing short. Those measures underline the importance of adhering to international established guidelines concerning stabilised approach criteria and the importance of making a go-around when the approach becomes unstable. The Final Report was published in 17 July 2018.
