On 6 August 2012 an Embraer Phenom 300 (CN-MBR) being operated by a Moroccan company Dalia Air on a commercial flight from Geneva to St. Gallen-Altenrhein under callsign DLI 211 overran the landing runway 10 after touching down from its second approach at destination in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) following a very low go around from the first one due to being too fast. It overran the runway and after passing through the aerodrome perimeter fence narrowly avoided a collision with a bus travelling on the public road beyond before coming to a stop in a field containing a tall crop. The aircraft was badly damaged but the sole passenger and the two pilots were not injured and were able to leave the aircraft unaided.
