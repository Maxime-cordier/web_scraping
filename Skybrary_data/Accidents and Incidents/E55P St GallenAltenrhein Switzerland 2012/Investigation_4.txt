is almost consistent with the flaps 1 position.. Late initiation of full brake application after landing.. Safety Action taken as a result of the event was noted to have included arrangements by Dalia Air for improved pilot training, including Crew Resource Management and corrective revisions by Embraer to the aircraft type QRH and AMM as well as certification of the FULL FLAP position on all Phenom 300 aircraft. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation. One, as follows, was made in the Interim Report issued on 31 January 2013: that The Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) should ensure that on all Swiss aerodromes, a hazard identification which includes the endangerment of third parties, at least in the immediate vicinity of the aerodrome, is determined and that appropriate measures will be taken to minimise it. [Safety Recommendation 461]. The second, as follows, was made at the conclusion of the Investigation: that The European Aviation Safety Agency (European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)) together with the Aircraft Manufacturer should examine how the manuals can be amended so as to provide optimal assistance to pilots in abnormal situations. [Safety Recommendation 482]. In respect of Recommendation 461, the Investigation noted that the FOCA had subsequently advised that a process for hazard identification at licensed aerodromes already existed under the obligation to have an SMS and that a similar requirement to undertake systematic hazard identification at unlicensed aerodromes would be disproportionate. It had therefore concluded that the Recommendation was "not necessaryâ€¦.or it has already been implemented". The Final Report was completed on 23 September 2014 and approved for publication by the Swiss AIB on 6 November 2014.
