On 23 August 2013, the Captain of a Boeing 757-200 (G-FCLK) being operated by an unrecorded airline with all passengers on board ready to depart from London Gatwick to Tenerife in normal daylight visibility decided that the discovery of hydraulic fluid leaking onto the brakes and producing smoke necessitated a precautionary rapid disembarkation of the passengers. His announcement to that effect was ineffective in communicating what was required and was interpreted by a significant number of the 220 passengers as an instruction to carry out an emergency evacuation during which 5 of them sustained minor injuries.
