that the switch manufacturer involved was reported to be "committed to updating their g-switch product line to incorporate time-delay features that would continue to supply power to the system for a predetermined interval following a switch activation". The formally-recorded Conclusion of the Investigation was that the accident "was the result of an early retraction of the retractable landing gear during take-off, which was not prevented by the landing gear selector lever and the retracting control logic". Four Contributory Factors were also identified: The First Officer's reduced concentration level. A break in the callout process / task sequence on the part of the First Officer. The actuation of the landing gear lever to the UP Position too early. Landing Gear control logic design allows retraction of the landing gear with one wheel airborne.. Safety Action taken as a result of the investigated event was noted as including the following: The Aircraft Operator has added an OFDM event aimed at tracking the prevalence of premature landing gear retraction. the Aircraft Manufacturer has devised a modification to the design logic on which gear selector function is predicated so that all gear assemblies must be airborne before gear selector movement to 'UP' will begin gear retraction. This change has been mandated by a Transport Canada AD which requires compliance within 18 months of publication.. The Final Report was completed on 31 October 2016 and published the following month. In view of the Safety Actions noted, no Safety Recommendations were made.
