as that used for the engines and that whilst this oil is capable of releasing toxic substances if a higher than normal temperature is reached, no evidence that this had occurred was found. However, it was further noted that an alternative lubricating oil to the one used is available which, when heated above normal temperatures, does not release the predominant toxin found in the oil in use. "However the Operator had decided not to use this oil, to ensure that it was not erroneously put into the engines, for which it is not certified". Safety Action taken by Air France was noted to have 'defined' six 'corrective actions' in the following matters: the use of breathing protection in the event of persistent smell;. the consolidation of flight crew knowledge of intercommunication resources;. the creation of a ‘‘precautionary deplaning’’ procedure;. the difficulty in putting on breathing protection;. the training of ground personnel in emergency evacuation;. the study of risks linked to the toxicity of smells and fumes from lubrication oils.. The Causes of the event were formally documented as follows: Smoke in the cabin and in the cockpit was generated by pyrolysis of oil at the level of the APU in the ventilation system. The presence of oil was due to a leak in a seal caused by failure of an APU ball race.. The flight crew decided to disembark the passengers quickly. The cabin crew positioned at doors 3 did not understand the Captain’s intentions and decided to carry out an emergency evacuation by opening the emergency exits. During this evacuation one passenger was seriously injured.. The imprecise language used by the Captain contributed to the misinterpretation of the order given.. The absence of a dedicated procedure for quick deplaning contributed to the Captain’s imprecise language and to erroneous interpretation by the cabin crew at doors 3.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published in English in July 2015. No Safety Recommendations were issued.
