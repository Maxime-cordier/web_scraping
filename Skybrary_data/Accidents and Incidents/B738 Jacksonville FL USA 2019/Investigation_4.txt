of the tyre footprint and the runway surface”. In this situation, the maximum wheel braking friction coefficient on a wet runway decreases with increasing speed. The Probable Cause of the accident was determined by the Board as “An extreme loss of braking friction due to heavy rain and the water depth on the un-grooved runway, which resulted in viscous hydroplaning”. A Contributory Factor to the accident was identified as: the operator’s inadequate guidance for evaluating runway braking conditions and conducting en route landing distance assessments.. Two Contributory Factors to the unstabilised approach were identified as: the Captain’s plan continuation bias and increased workload due to the weather conditions and line training responsibilities.. the First Officer’s lack of experience.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 4 August 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
