An Investigation was carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) data was available to assist. The weather at the time of the accident was found to have been light rain with broken cloud at 600ft aal and the wind northerly and gusting up to 20 knots. It was noted that the flight crew were on the second part of a split duty and that the aircraft commander had been acting as PF. The LLZ approach made was found to have been unstable and below 500 ft aal, the speed had been allowed to increase to Reference Speed (Vref) + 24 where it remained until arrival over the runway and floating. An airport surveillance video showed that the aircraft eventually touched down with only 686m of runway remaining. Data from the aircraft manufacturer based on the ELW of the accident aircraft showed that the LDR had been approximately 860m on a dry runway or 1097m on a wet runway, without wind factoring. The failure to initiate (or apparently to even consider) initiating a go around when the airspeed became excessive was noted. The full NTSB Final Report of the Investigation includes the following Probable Cause, determined by NTSB on 22 June 2011 as: “The pilot-in-command's failure to attain the proper touchdown point while landing with a gusting crosswind and failure to initiate a go-around, which resulted in a landing more than halfway down the runway and a subsequent runway overrun.” It was also considered that: “Contributing to the incident was the failure of either pilot to call for a go-around when the airplane was at Vref plus 15 at 50 feet above the runway or once they had floated well beyond the touchdown zone of the runway.” No Safety Recommendations were made.
