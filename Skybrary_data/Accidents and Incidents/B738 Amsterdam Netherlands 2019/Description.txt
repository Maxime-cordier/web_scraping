On 6 September 2019, a Boeing 737-800 (PH-HSJ) being operated by KLM subsidiary Transavia on a scheduled international passenger flight from Amsterdam to Chania and cleared to takeoff from runway 18C in normal night visibility actually began doing so on the parallel taxiway and did not commence what was a high speed rejected take off until told to by the controller. The crew then decided they should try again and this subsequent takeoff as cleared was normal.
