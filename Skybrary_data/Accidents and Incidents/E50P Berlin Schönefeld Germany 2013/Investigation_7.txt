the syllabus for the acquisition of the type rating more precisely to the effect that pilots unmistakably understand the importance and operation of the ice protection and the stall warning protection systems of the EMB-500. [10/2018]. that the Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (ANAC) - the Brazilian aviation authority should, in cooperation with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), ascertain that the aircraft manufacture of the EMB-500 renders the syllabus for the acquisition of the type rating more precisely to the effect that pilots unmistakably understand the importance, function and operation of the ice protection and the stall warning protection systems of the EMB-500. [11/2018]. It was also noted that in connection with another Investigation still in progress, that the BFU has also issued the following Safety Recommendation which has relevance to this Investigation. It is as follows: that the Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) should amend the Air Traffic Services Manual of Operations (MO-ATS) to the effect that the assignment of a final approach speed takes into account the separation requirements, the approach classification of the respective airplane and the Safety Gates the pilots have to adhere to. This amendment should read “Prior to assigning a speed, the pilot should be asked which speed could be maintained up to which distance to the touch-down point” and “Single engine turboprop aircraft should not be given any speeds after initiation of the descent”. [12/2018]. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed on 17 December 2018 and subsequently published online.
