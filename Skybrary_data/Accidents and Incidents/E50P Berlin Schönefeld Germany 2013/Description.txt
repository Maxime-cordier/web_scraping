On 15 February 2013, the crew of an Embraer EMB-500 Phenom 100 (OO-MAS) being operated by Abelag Aviation on a non-scheduled flight from Kortrijk-Wevelgem to Berlin Sch√∂nefeld with one passenger on board lost control of the aircraft just before touchdown at destination in day VMC and it crashed on the edge of the runway ending up just off it. None of the three occupants were injured but the aircraft was severely damaged and damage was caused to both the runway surface and runway lighting.
