On 19 January 2021, a Boeing 737-400SF (G-JMCY) being operated by West Atlantic on a scheduled cargo flight from East Midlands to Exeter became unstabilised below 500 feet during its night VMC approach at destination and touchdown occurred with a high rate of descent and a recorded 3.8g vertical acceleration. Once the aircraft had reached its parking stand, the extent of the damage sustained became apparent and prevented the unloading of the sacks of mail on board. There were no injuries to the two pilots but the resultant structural damage to the aircraft led to it being subsequently declared a hull loss.
