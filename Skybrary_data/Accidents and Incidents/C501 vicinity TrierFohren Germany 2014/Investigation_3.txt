the earlier forecast. The weather recorded at Trier-Fohren at the time of the accident included a visibility of 100-150 metres in freezing fog with a surface wind from 040Â° at 3-5 knots. The Causes of the Accident were formally identified as follows: The Pilot in Command (PIC) decided to conduct the VFR approach even though he was aware of the prevailing instrument weather conditions at the airport.. It is likely that a wrong vertical profile was flown due to an erroneous selection on the navigation system.. Due to the insufficient situational awareness of the pilots, the descent was not stopped in time.. One Contributory Factor was also identified: Insufficient Crew Resource Management (CRM). The Final Report was completed on 18 October 2016 and subsequently published. The BFU noted that Part NCC of Commission Regulation (EC) No 965/2012 for non-commercial flights with technically complicated powered aircraft had come into force on 25 August 2016 and included requirements for the organisation, risk management and procedures for non-public company flights such as the accident flight and "therefore refrains from issuing safety recommendations regarding this matter".
