On 22 March 2013, a privately operated Cessna 525 (N600HS) being operated from Paris CDG to Sion and in descent to destination under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) lost prescribed separation in Class 'C' Airspace against an opposite direction Piaggio P180 Avanti ll (D-IKSI) which was also privately operated and had just departed Sion for Braunschweig, Germany under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). Both aircraft were equipped only with Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) 1 systems, neither of which generated a TA and neither pilot saw the other during the crossing.
