below -10Â°C and a fuel flow above flight idle.. Certification requirements, with which the aircraft and engine fuel systems had to comply, did not take account of this phenomenon as the risk was unrecognised at that time.. During the Investigation, on 28 November 2008, a Boeing 777-200ER being operated by Delta Airlines from Shanghai to Atlanta suffered an in-flight engine rollback on one engine which recovered normal function after an 8000 feet descent and the intended flight was subsequently completed. An investigation by the NTSB with assistance from the UK AAIB concluded that similar causation had applied and four Safety Recommendations similar to some of those developed by the UK Investigation were issued to the FAA and EASA in March 2009. The Final Report was published on 9 February 2010. A total of 18 Safety Recommendations were made during and as a result of the UK AAIB Investigation as follows: One made in the Report S1/2008 published on18 February 2008: That Boeing should notify all Boeing 777 operators of the necessity to operate the fuel control switch to cutoff prior to operation of the fire handle, for both the fire drill and the evacuation drill, and ensure that all versions of its checklists, including electronic and placarded versions of the drill, are consistent with this procedure. (2008-009). Three made in the Interim Report published on 15 September 2008: That the FAA and EASA, in conjunction with Boeing and Rolls Royce, introduce interim measures for the Boeing 777, powered by Trent 800 engines, to reduce the risk of ice formed from water in aviation turbine fuel causing a restriction in the fuel feed system. (2008-047). That the FAA and EASA should take immediate action to Consider the implications of the findings of this investigation on other certificated airframe / engine combinations. (2008-048). That the FAA and EAS review the current certification requirements to ensure that aircraft and engine fuel systems are tolerant to the potential build up and sudden release of ice in the fuel feed systems. (2008-049). Five made in Interim Report 2 published on 12 March 2009 That Boeing and Rolls Royce jointly review the aircraft and engine fuel system design for the Boeing 777, powered by Rolls Royce Trent 800 engines, to develop changes which prevent ice from causing a restriction to the fuel flow at the fuel oil heat exchanger. (2009-028). That the Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency consider mandating design changes that are introduced as a result of recommendation 2009-028, developed to prevent ice from causing a restriction to the fuel flow at the fuel oil heat exchanger on Boeing 777 aircraft powered by Rolls Royce Trent 800 engines.(2009-029). That the FAA and EASA conduct a study into the feasibility of expanding the use of anti ice additives in aviation turbine fuel on civil aircraft. (2009-030). That the FAA and EASA jointly conduct research into ice formation in aviation turbine fuels. . (2009-031). That the FAA and EASA jointly conduct research into
