ice accumulation and subsequent release mechanisms within aircraft and engine fuel systems. (2009-032). Nine New Safety Recommendations made in the Final Report: That the EASA introduce a requirement to record, on a DFDR, the operational position of each engine fuel metering device where practicable. (2009-091). That the FAA introduce a requirement to record, on a DFDR, the operational position of each engine fuel metering device where practicable.(2009-092). That Boeing minimise the amount of buffering of data, prior to its being recorded on a QAR, on all Boeing 777 aircraft. (2009-093). That Boeing apply the modified design of the B777 200LR main landing gear drag brace, or an equivalent measure, to prevent fuel tank rupture, on future Boeing 777 models and continuing production of existing models of the type. (2009-094). That the FAA amends their requirements for landing gear emergency loading conditions to include combinations of side loads. (2009-095). That the FAA, in conjunction with the European Aviation Safety Agency review the requirements for landing gear failures to include the effects of landing on different types of surface. (2009-096). That the FAA require that Boeing modify the design, for the Boeing 777, of the indirect ceiling light assemblies, their associated attachments, and their immediate surroundings to ensure that the fluorescent tubes, or their fragments, will be retained in a survivable impact. (2009-097). That the FAA and EASA, review the qualification testing requirements applied by manufacturers to cabin fittings, to allow for dynamic flexing of fuselage and cabin structure. (2009-098). That the EASA mandate MSB4400-25MB059 Revision 3 to require the inspection and replacement of the video monitor fittings on the Ricardo seat model 4400. (2009-100). In response to AAIB Safety Recommendation 2008-047, Boeing introduced operational changes to provide interim mitigation of the risk of engine fuel starvation attributable to fuel icing in Trent 800 powered Boeing 777s. In response to the 2009 recommendations by both this Investigation and the related NTSB Incident Investigation previously noted, Rolls Royce developed a modified version of the FOHE installed on the accident aircraft which was then mandated for retrofit and new build by EASA. Replacement of all the Foes on Rolls Royce powered Boeing 777s with the new design was completed during September 2010.
