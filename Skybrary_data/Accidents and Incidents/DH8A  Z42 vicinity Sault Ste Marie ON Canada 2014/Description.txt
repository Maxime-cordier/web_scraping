On 3 September 2014, a Bombardier DHC8-100 (C-GJMI) being operated by Jazz Aviation on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Sault Ste. Marie to Toronto as JZA7794 and a Zlin Z242L being operated for pilot training purposes by Sault College and manoeuvring came into very close conflict in day VMC despite the DH8 crew having visual contact and responding accordingly.
