the C-FANU flight crew during their visual scan prior to the spin, possibly due to its position below the aircraft nose or wing, or due to a lack of anticipation.. The JZA7794 flight crew was unaware of the possibility that there were training aircraft in the vicinity and, lacking this information, had no reason to anticipate that the opposing traffic would initiate a rapidly descending turn. As a result, their initial action of leveling off the aircraft at 4500 feet was insufficient to resolve the risk of collision once C-FANU initiated the spin.. The irregular flight path of the spin put the 2 aircraft on a collision course before an evasive turn by JZA7794 caused the aircraft to pass each other, separated by 350 â€“ 450 feet laterally.. Risk If manoeuvres related to flight training take place in controlled airspace that is not specifically designated for such training or known to air traffic control, there is an increased risk of collision, as these types of manoeuvres can be difficult for controllers or the crews of conflicting traffic to anticipate.. Safety Action taken by Sault College FTU during the course of the Investigation was noted to have included the introduction of a new procedure requiring their aircraft to "notify Sault Ste. Marie TWR once within 10 nm of the CTZ if/when doing spins", to "not do any spins within the departure/approach paths of any aerodromes in the surrounding area" and to "contact Toronto ACC when completing exercises in the (Sault Ste. Marie) VOR area". The Final Report was authorised for release on 23 September 2015 and officially released on 15 October 2015. No Safety Recommendations were issued.
