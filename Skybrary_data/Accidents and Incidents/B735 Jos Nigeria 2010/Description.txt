On 24 August 2010, a Boeing 737-500 (5N-BLE) being operated by Aero Contractors Nigeria on a scheduled domestic passenger flight (210) from Lagos to Jos made an uncontrolled touchdown at destination after a daylight non-precision approach had become unstabilised and remained so after the visual reference transition to land. The aircraft departed the side of the runway onto the grass before regaining the centreline and stopping. Damage to the aircraft was substantial but there were no occupant injuries. Three runway light assemblies and some armoured electrical cables were also damaged.
