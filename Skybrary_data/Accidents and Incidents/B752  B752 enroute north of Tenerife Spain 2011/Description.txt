On 20 November 2011, approximately 100 nm north of Tenerife, Canary Islands, separation was lost in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) between a Boeing 757-200 being operated by Finnair on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Helsinki to Tenerife South and another Boeing 757-200 being operated by Thomas Cook AL on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Manchester to Tenerife South. None of the 460 occupants of the two aeroplanes were injured during the TCAS RA manoeuvres that followed.
