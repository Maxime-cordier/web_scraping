On 13 July 2012, a Gulfstream G-IV (N823GA) being operated by USA-based Universal Jet Aviation on an out of service positioning flight from Nice to Le Castellet with only the three crew members on board left destination runway 13 at speed after making a relatively uneventful touchdown off a visual approach in normal daylight visibility. Passage through the perimeter fence and then collision with trees and rocks was followed instantly by fuel-fed fire from which the three occupants were unable to escape and died. Most of the aircraft was destroyed as a result of the impacts and fire and damage was caused to runway and PAPI lighting as well as the fence.
