[2015-041]. that the FAA ensure that G-IV operators and Gulfstream set up procedures conducive to verifying the activation of the ground spoilers during landing, similar to that used for thrust reversers. [2015-042]. that the EASA ensure that G-IV operators and Gulfstream set up procedures conducive to verifying the activation of the ground spoilers during landing, similar to that used for thrust reversers. [2015-043]. that the EASA in coordination with FAA assess the compliance of the G-IV with the certification requirements relating to the indication of the position of the ground spoilers. [2015-044]. that the EASA ensure that the Certification Specifications (article 25-699 of the CS 25 regulations) require that information on the position of the ground spoilers be available on landing.

[2015-046]. that the FAA ensure that Gulfstream review the warning logic when the ground spoilers are not armed, and the spoiler arming procedure, in order to cover the situation of a failure to arm the spoilers brought to light by this investigation. [2015-047]. that the FAA ensure that carrying out checklists in ‘‘challenge and response’’ mode becomes systematic practice at Universal Jet Aviation.

[2015-050]. that the FAA, in conjunction with Gulfstream, review the relevance of changing the order of the items on the ‘‘before landing’’ checklist in order to place the EICAS check after arming the ground spoilers. [2015-051]. that the DGAC ensure that aerodrome operators have defined procedures that guarantee that the level of protection provided corresponds to that indicated, including: informing the ATC service (or the AFIS agent) in case of an unexpected decrease in the level of RFFS protection initially guaranteed; the definition of the conditions for carrying out each of the ancillary tasks requested of aerodrome fire-fighters so that they do not jeopardize the outcome of the operational objective.
