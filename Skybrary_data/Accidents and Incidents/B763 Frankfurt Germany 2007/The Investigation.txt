An Investigation into the occurrence was carried out by BFU, who determined that: "The smoldering fire in the insulation material was located below defective strap of molten cables." The Primary cause of this incident was motion between the wire loom and strap (relative motion), resulting in wear to the insulation material on both parts (electrical cable/strap). The abrasion, and the fact that that this was repeated incident, could be taken as an indication that the cable straps were unsuitable for cable straps routeing in this area. The consequences arising from wear could be avoided by limiting strap service life, by periodic inspections, or fitting a plastic strap. The preferred solution would be a design change. In this aircraft, it would be sufficient to replace the existing cable straps at this location with plastic fittings. The immediate causes of this serious incident were identified as: "A short-circuit caused by the circuit breakers to trip in the rear freight hold temperature monitoring circuit, and the electrical power supply circuit to the APU gas turbine.. An electrical short-circuit took place between cables, cause by abraded insulation on a wire loom strap. This was located behind the cladding on the rear freight hold forward bulkhead and resulted in fire.. Following the landing, further electrical systems were activated automatically, resulting in a second short-circuit fire.. This-short circuit fire started a smouldering fire in the insulation mats behind the freight hold cladding, generating a lot of smoke.. The systematic causes of the incident were identified as: Since the protection of the electrical system was suboptimal a short-circuit was the result, allowing cables to melt and catch fire, resulting in damage to the electrical system and a smouldering fire in the insulation mat.. The aircraft maintenance schedule did not specify regular inspections or a maximum service life for the insulated cable straps..
