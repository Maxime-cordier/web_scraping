On 13 March 2012, an Airbus A340-300 on a scheduled passenger flight from Bamako, Mali to Paris CDG, with LVP in force due to fog, continued a night Category 3 ILS approach to runway 08R in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) beyond the point where there was any possibility of a landing before initiating a go around after which a second approach to the same runway was completed uneventfully.
