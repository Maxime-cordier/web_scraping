that given the time of the event - 0550 local time - flight crew and controller fatigue may have been a factor. Five Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the EASA ensure that the national authorities ensure that all operators define explicit operational limits in their documentation providing pilots with assistance in the decision before intercepting the glide path from above [FRAN-2013-005]. that the DGAC ensure that operators and the DSNA be made aware of the lessons from the 2006 symposium organised by the DGAC relating to non-stabilised approaches [FRAN-2013-006]. that the DGAC study the implementation of a system enabling controllers to determine the vertical position of an aircraft in relation to the published glide path. [FRAN-2013-007]. that the EASA ensure that aircraft ILS modes are not engaged on an ILS signal other than the one corresponding to the published descent path; that failing this, a system enabling the crew to be alerted be put in place [FRAN-2013-008]. that the EASA ensure that the activation of aircraft ILS modes in autopilot does not lead to inappropriate attitudes during approach [FRAN-2013-009]. The Final Report of the Investigation was published September 2013 after its earlier publication in French in March 2013.
