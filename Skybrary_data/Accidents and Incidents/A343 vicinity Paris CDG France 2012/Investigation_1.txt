An Investigation was carried out by the French Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA) based upon flight data from the DAR and interviews with the crew and the controllers involved. By the time the event was notified to the BEA, the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) recording of the event had been overwritten. It was confirmed that the aircraft commander had been PF throughout and that, with the aircraft stable at FL090 and about 30nm from the threshold of the allocated landing runway 08R, APP had cleared the aircraft to intercept the ILS LOC. Soon afterwards as the aircraft reached the 3° GS, a clearance to FL080 and then FL060 was given. As a slow descent began in OP DES (Open Descent) mode rather than the SOP VS mode, the ILS LOC was captured, speed remained at 250 knots and deviation above the height of the ILS GS continued to increase. As it passed 7220 ft QNH, the aircraft was still at 250 knots and 17.5nm from the threshold (equivalent to about 1125 ft above the ILS GS) when ATC requested that speed should be maintained at “more than 200 knots” and gave further descent to 3000 ft. The crew selected 220 knots and 3000 ft whilst remaining in OP DES mode so that the rate of descent decreased since in that mode, acquisition of the selected speed takes priority. The rate of descent was increased to 1840 fpm after airbrake deployment but at 10nm from the threshold, the aircraft was at 5500 ft Altimeter Pressure Settings when instructed to maintain a speed of not less than 160 knots and change to TWR. Selection of a lower speed in OP DES mode again had the effect of reducing the rate of descent and increasing the deviation above the GS. Following clearance to land, the second AP was engaged, slats/flap config 2 selected and at 4nm with the aircraft 2100 feet above the ILS GS height for that range, and with the PFD indicating that the GS was being approached from above, the ILS GS was armed by selecting APPR mode. At that point, the Investigation calculated that the aircraft was within a false lobe radiating at about 10°. About 30 seconds later, when the aircraft was 2nm from the threshold and 2500 feet above it and just after the landing gear had been selected down, the aircraft AP suddenly pitched the aircraft up (towards the captured false GS). Over 12 seconds, pitch increased from 1° to 26°, the vertical speed changed from 1600fpm down to 3300fpm up and airspeed dropped from 160 knots to 130knots. At that point, with the thrust levers at idle, the crew disconnected both autopilots, the PF pushed the control column forward “almost down to the stop” and the airbrakes were stowed. With airspeed increased to 147 knots, AP1 was re-engaged with LOC and GS modes active and CL thrust was selected with the reported intention of commencing a go around. With the aircraft at a height of
