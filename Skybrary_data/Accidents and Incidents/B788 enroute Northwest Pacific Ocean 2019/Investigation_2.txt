Cause of both air conditioning systems shutting down at the same time was found to have been the left air conditioning system restart attempt being made at above the recommended altitude of 35,000 feet which made the Cabin Air Compressors more susceptible to surging. Safety Action taken by All Nippon Airways as a result of this event and known to (and recommended by) the Investigation was noted as having included the airline making changes to its Company OM updating procedures to ensure that technical information issued by an aircraft manufacturer relating to non-normal procedures or other matters with potentially serious safety implications are in future promptly reviewed and the OM modified accordingly. The Final Report was adopted by the JTSB on 6 November 2020 and published in both English translation and the definitive Japanese version on 26 November 2020. No Safety Recommendations were made.
