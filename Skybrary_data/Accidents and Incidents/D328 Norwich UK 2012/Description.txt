On 22 March 2012, a Dornier 328 being operated by Scot Airways for Loganair under a Flybe franchise on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Manchester to Norwich briefly departed the left side of the runway shortly after a daylight touchdown at destination in normal ground visibility following a non precision approach before carrying out a go around and a subsequently successful Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach and landing on the opposite runway direction. The aircraft was undamaged by the excursion but a runway edge light was broken.
