following a Serious Incident. The Conclusion of the Investigation was that: “In this incident, the commander, who was the PF, was not visual with the runway at MDA and, in accordance with the company operating manual, should have initiated a go-around. Instead he levelled the aircraft in the hope of gaining visual references with the runway. When he did gain this visual reference the aircraft was not in a position to land without applying significant angles of bank at low level. This resulted in the aircraft touching down and tracking off the runway, with the right landing gear leaving the paved surface.” The Final Report AAIB Bulletin: 12/2012 EW/G2012/03/04 was published on 13 December 2012. No Safety Recommendations were made.
