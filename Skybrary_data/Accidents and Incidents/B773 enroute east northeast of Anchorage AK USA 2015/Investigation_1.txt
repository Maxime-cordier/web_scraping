An Investigation was carried out by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board. Relevant data was successfully recovered from the DFDR but since the aircraft did not land until 2 hours 45 minutes after the investigated event and the CVR continued to run, none of its data, in particular use of the cabin PA system, were of any use. It was noted that the DFDR did not record the position of the flight deck switch which is used to switch the seat belt sign on and off. It was noted that the Captain had accumulated 22,529 total flying hours which included 5,061 hours on type and the First Officer 13,906 total flying hours including 5,814 hours on type. The two augmenting crew members had 19,738 and 5,221 total flying hours of which respectively 1,459 and 1,433 hours were on type. The turbulence occurred with the augmenting crew in control and the First Officer acting as PF. It was established that three Air Canada fights were taking a similar eastbound track across Alaska with AC 088 being the third. First in the sequence was another 777 90 minutes ahead and second was 787 30 minutes ahead. Whilst the flight under investigation was still over the Pacific Ocean and almost three hours ahead of the turbulence encounter, a SIGMET advising of occasionally severe turbulence over southern Alaska between FL 260 and FL 400 was issued. About an hour later, the augmenting crew routinely took over and were briefed accordingly. ATC were contacted to see if any reports of more than moderate turbulence had been received for their cruise level of FL 330 and were told that none had. Soon after this, the 777 ahead encountered moderate to severe turbulence at FL 350 within the area covered by the SIGMET and had initially descended to FL 330 where the turbulence was less but then returned to FL 350 to stay clear of cloud. A further short period of similar turbulence followed and in a direct ACARS communication with the 787 which was following at FL390, the lead aircraft crew "strongly advised" a diversion off track to the south which the 787 crew subsequently made and the turbulence experienced in the same vicinity was no more than moderate. Approximately 35 minutes before the area of forecast turbulence was expected to be reached, the cabin crew were instructed to secure the cabin and appropriate announcements were made in English, French and Mandarin with checks following. About half an hour later, ATC advised of reports of moderate to severe turbulence in the notified area at both FL 280 and FL 350. The crew decided to stay on their flight-planned track at FL 330 based on information they had obtained from Air Canada dispatch and on "visual cues suggesting that FL 330 would have the least turbulence". At about the same time, with all cabin crew secured in their seats, a passenger in row 1 got up to use the toilet and ignored a request to return to his
