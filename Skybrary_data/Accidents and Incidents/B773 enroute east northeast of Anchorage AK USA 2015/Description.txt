On 30 December 2015, a Boeing 777-300ER (C-FRAM) being operated by Air Canada on a scheduled international passenger flight from Shanghai Pudong to Toronto as ACA 088 with an augmented crew encountered a period of moderate to severe turbulence in day VMC as it crossed southern Alaska at FL 330 eight hours after take-off from Shanghai. One of the two air conditioning systems also failed. One of the 332 passengers was seriously injured and 20 others sustained minor injuries. There was some damage to cabin fittings.
