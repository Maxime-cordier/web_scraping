their possessions, and on others, then there is a risk that it will reduce the probability of seat belt use.. If passengers do not expect consequences and enforcement for non-seat belt use, passengers may not perceive the use of seat belts as mandatory, when so directed.. If the approach to improve seat belt use does not include an understanding of the cultural and social norms of passengers, education to increase awareness, improved attitudes and an associated enforcement program to ensure corresponding changes in behaviour, then there is a risk that passengers will not wear their seat belts.. If V-clamps are not installed using the proper procedure and torque, then there is a risk of V-clamp failure and subsequent partial loss of an air conditioning system and cabin pressurization.. One Other Finding was also identified: The Air Canada flight 088 flight crewâ€™s decision to secure the cabin and reduce to turbulence penetration speed contributed to preventing significant numbers of injuries in the cabin and potential damage to the aircraft.. Safety Action taken as a result of the occurrence by Air Canada was noted as having included the provision of improved guidance on CAT for pilots, amplified procedures in respect of forecasts of moderate or severe turbulence and the commencement of a programme to change all air conditioning supply duct couplings with the improved one already available but not previously implemented. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 4 January 2017 and it was officially released on 20 February 2017. No Safety Recommendations were made.
