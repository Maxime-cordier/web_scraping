The New Zealand TAIC carried out the Accident Investigation. Their Final Report was published on 11 June 1997 and found that “the Cessna pilot should have allowed more time or distance between his aircraft and the departing Boeing 727. It was concluded that the pilot had then misjudged the likely region of wake turbulence in relation to his take-off path. It was also found that the error resulted not from a lack appropriate flight experience or a lack of awareness of wake turbulence and the adverse effects it can have on an aircraft encountering it but from a lapse in concentration. It was suggested in the Investigation Report that this lapse was probably partly due to the routine nature of the flight and partly because of the pilots preoccupation with some personal business problems which he had been dealing with prior to the accident flight and which remained unresolved. The Report noted that “Standard separation criteria have been implemented world wide with good reason due to the viciousness and somewhat unpredictable nature of wing-tip vortices. Aerodrome controllers have an appropriate responsibility for only issuing advice and warnings about the potential for wake turbulence and for applying standard separations when they consider that wake turbulence is likely to exist. Pilots must accept the responsibility for avoiding wake turbulence, and use sound judgement when any warnings about its existence are given. Aerodrome controllers however should have clear guidelines to follow when granting a waiver of the separation standards. Some countries do not allow waivers to be granted in certain circumstances.” It also noted that “Some commercial operators allow their pilots to request (wake vortex separation) waivers. The potential therefore exists for a similar occurrence at a busy aerodrome with more disastrous results should an aircraft, for example, collide with a terminal building or strike a taxiing aircraft.”
