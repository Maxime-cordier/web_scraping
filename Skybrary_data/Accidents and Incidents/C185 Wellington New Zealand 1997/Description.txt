On Monday 3 March 1997 at 1014 hours, privately owned and operated Cessna 185 became airborne after a take off roll which had begun at a mid-point runway position on runway 16 at Wellington International Aerodrome, behind a Boeing 727 which had just departed from the full length of the same runway and climbed directly ahead. The take off clearance given followed the pilotâ€™s request to ATC for a waiver of the recommended wake turbulence separation which applied which ATC had granted as they were entitled to. When the Cessna encountered wake turbulence from the previous departing aircraft, the pilot lost control of the aircraft at a height from which recovery was not possible and the aircraft descended to the ground. Neither of the two occupants was injured but the aircraft was substantially damaged.
