On 7 October 2014, an Airbus A330-300 (C-GFAF) being operated by Air Canada on a scheduled passenger flight from Frankfurt to Montr√©al as ACA 875 had flown a daylight ILS approach. After gaining the required visual reference to continue the approach, forward visibility was reduced in a sudden heavy rain shower and the aircraft briefly departed the side of the runway immediately after touchdown. It then regained the runway centreline before completing the landing roll and subsequently taxiing to its assigned parking gate at the terminal. A number of runway edge lights were broken but the aircraft was undamaged except for tyre cuts sufficient to require two wheel changes caused by destructive impact with the edge lights.
