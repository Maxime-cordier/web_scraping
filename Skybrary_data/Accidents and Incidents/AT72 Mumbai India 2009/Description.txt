On 10 November 2009, an ATR 72-200 being operated by Kingfisher Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Bhavnagar to Mumbai India made a non precision approach to runway 27 at destination in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) and, after touching down late, left the runway at speed during landing. It ended up substantially damaged but there was no fire and none of the 42 occupants were injured.
