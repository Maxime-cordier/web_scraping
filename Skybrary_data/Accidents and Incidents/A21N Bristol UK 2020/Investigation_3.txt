opportunity for them to query any last minute changes directly. However, the operatorâ€™s biosecurity measures required interactions with the flight deck to be minimised, so the load and trim sheet was delivered to the SCCM. As the designated ground handler did not visit the flight deck, the flight crew were more likely to accept changes presented to them without discussion and complete their tasks as defined in their SOPs. Safety Action taken by EasyJet as a result of the investigation findings was noted to have included the following: Introduced a procedure where when an aircraft type variant is changed, the Network Control team in the Integrated Control Centre (ICC) must conduct a manual check between the IT systems used for planning and loading to ensure the correct aircraft type and registration are displayed in all systems.. Introduced a requirement for the Chief Pilot, in coordination with the ICC, to notify the duty pilot of any aircraft type changes. The duty pilot will then discuss the potential risk with the operating crew involved.. A manual count of the number of passengers in each seating bay must be completed before departure for every flight.. Initiated a further investigation into their IT systems to determine how operational changes are managed and communicated between the relevant parts of the system in order for a permanent solution to the current inadequacies to be implemented.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 14 October 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
