On 3 January 2020, the crew of an Airbus A321neo (G-UZMI) being operated by EasyJet on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Bristol to Edinburgh found that the passengers boarded had been given seats such that their distribution in the cabin was considered unusual but the load and trim sheet indicated that it was allowable. The same unusual seating then happened on the next sector but this time the allocated seating was incompatible with the safe operation of the flight and passengers were reseated accordingly on the Captains instructions. An internal investigation prompted by the Captain’s safety report discovered a systemic flaw in the operator’s load control system was to blame and the first flight was found to have been inadvertently operated outside permitted limits.
