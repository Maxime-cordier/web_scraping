After landing, ground staff reported that the left hand main landing gear door was missing and it was subsequently found at a location on the ground corresponding to the position where the unexplained noise/movement had occurred in flight. Related mainly superficial damage to the aircraft was then identified. None of the 51 passengers were injured.
