Based on the results of the investigation, the BFU has issued the following safety recommendations: The Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs should agree with the Laender aviation authorities responsible for the airports on a joint procedure of the cognizant supervisory authorities designed to urge the ground services responsible for de-icing to apply not only thickened (Type II or Type IV) but also unthickened (Type I) de-icing fluids on airports regularly used by aircraft with non-powered flying controls and offering de-icing services.. The European national accident investigation authorities should recommend to their respective aviation authorities to see that not only thickened (Type II or Type IV) but also unthickened (Type I) de-icing fluids are applied on airports regularly used by aircraft with non-powered flying controls and offering de-icing services.. Aircraft de-icing to maintain the airworthiness of aircraft during winter operation should be accomplished by certified and approved companies under the supervision of civil aviation authorities. If aircraft de-icing is not accomplished by an operator or an approved maintenance organisation the ground service "aircraft de-icing" should be subject to appropriate aeronautical regulation. European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) should agree with the European national authorities on establishing such regulations.. The expected drying and re-hydration properties of thickened de-icing fluids (Type II, III, IV) for aircraft de-icing should be described and defined by standardization in such detail as to eliminate significant quality variations among the products of different manufacturers. EASA should develop certification criteria to establish mandatory limits for and require evidence of unrestricted suitability of such fluids for aircraft with non-powered flying controls.. Considering the thickened de-icing fluids currently available EASA should impose a mandatory requirement on non-powered flying controlled aircraft manufacturers to develop reliable procedures for their aircraft types to ensure the identification and removal of re-hydrated de-icing fluid residues in such time as to prevent any risk to the safety of flight operation.. Note of the SKYbrary Editor * thickened de-icing fluids (SAE Type II, Type III or Type IV) have a small portion of a polymer added to adjust their viscose-elastic properties to the requirements for prolonged re-icing protection unlike the un-thickened de-icing fluid (SAE Type I) which is relatively rare in Europe.
