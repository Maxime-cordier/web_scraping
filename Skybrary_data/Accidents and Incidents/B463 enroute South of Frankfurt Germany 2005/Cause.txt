Immediate causes for the serious incident were identified as: Several de-icing procedures with thickened de-icing fluids* (Type II) caused an accumulation of dry fluid residues (polymer residues) in the gap between elevator and horizontal stabilizer;. Due to atmospheric exposure these highly hygroscopic residues absorbed, from the surrounding air, a multiple of their own weight of water, became a gel-like mass and swelled-up to many times their original volume;. With low ambient air temperatures the over-saturated gel froze increasing its volume to such an extent that it jammed the elevator and horizontal stabilizer;. Elevator control was jammed due to ice formation because the aircraft did not have powered flying controls and the necessary power to move the elevator tab mechanically could not be generated..
