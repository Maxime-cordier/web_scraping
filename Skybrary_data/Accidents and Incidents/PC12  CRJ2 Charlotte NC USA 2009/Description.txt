On 29 May 2009, the flight crew of a Bombardier CRJ 200 being operated by PSA Airlines on a departing scheduled passenger flight in normal daylight visibility observed a small aircraft enter the runway ahead of them whilst at high speed on their full length take off roll at Charlotte but were able to make an emergency stop on the centerline just clear of the other aircraft, a privately operated Pilatus PC12, which had moved to the side of the runway when its pilot realised what was going on.
