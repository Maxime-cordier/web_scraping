On 31 October 2000, a Boeing 747-400 (9V-SPK) being operated by Singapore Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Taipei, Taiwan to Los Angeles as SQ006 commenced a night take off on a partially closed runway in reduced (but not low) visibility instead of on the runway instructed by ATC who were unaware of the error. The subsequent collision with construction equipment on the closed section of the runway used and the resultant severe post crash fire destroyed the aircraft fatally injuring 83 of the 170 occupants, seriously injuring 39 more and causing minor injuries to 32 others. All three flight crew survived and two of them as well as 23 passengers were uninjured.
