Angeles - were found to have been employed by Singapore Airlines since being recruited as cadets. The aircraft commander, a Malaysian national born in 1959, had first qualified as a First Officer on the 747-300 in 1986 and had been promoted to Captain on the A310 in 1995 and had transferred to the 747-400 in 1998. He had accumulated 11235 flying hours including 2017 on the 747-400. The First Officer, a Singaporean born in 1964, had first qualified in that rank on the Airbus A310 in 1997 before serving on the Boeing 777 and then joining the 747-400 fleet in February 2000. He had accumulated 2442 flying hours including 552 on the 747-400. The Supernumerary First Officer had also first qualified on the Airbus A310 before joining the 747-400 fleet in 1995, he had accumulated 5508 flying hours including 4518 on the 747-400. Whist forward visibility was found not to have been such as to preclude normal taxiing, around the time of the attempted take off it was being reported as 600 metres in heavy rain, with similar RVRs given for both in-use runways. It was found from the CVR that the Captain had been reminded by his First Officer as the aircraft reached the end of taxiway NP that "next is November 1" and had responded " OK, second right" which had then been confirmed as correct by the First Officer. Take off clearance for runway 05L had just been received after changing to the TWR frequency when the aircraft reached the closely spaced illuminated green centreline lights leading onto runway 05R - the first rather than the second right turn. The Captain had proceeded to taxi the aircraft (slowly due to the potentially slippery wet surface) into position on runway 05R with no challenge from either of the other pilots except to note the failure of the aircraft position to match the Para Visual Display (PVD) which appeared to have been discounted by the Captain. Take off was commenced in the normal way soon afterwards but 21 seconds after the 80 knots call, the CVR recorded the Captain uttering an 'expletive' and exclaiming that there was "something there". One second later (some 33 seconds after the take off roll had commenced) the sound of the first impact occurred; the FDR recorded a ground speed of approximately 131 knots at the end of the recording. It was concluded that the crew had failed to review their taxi route “in a manner sufficient to ensure they all understood that the route to Runway 05L included the need for the aircraft to pass Runway 05R before taxiing onto Runway 05L”. It was accepted that the limited forward visibility had prevented recognition of the obstructions further down the runway and considered that the association of the deteriorating weather with a typhoon approaching had constituted “moderate time pressure” to take off before the inbound typhoon closed in. The latter was considered likely to have “subtly influenced the flight crew’s decision making ability and
