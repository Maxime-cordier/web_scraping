The Belgian AAIU carried out the Accident Investigation and noted that the initial phase of the take-off run had occurred normally with the speed increasing under a constant acceleration until one of the engines experienced a bird strike. This caused a momentary loss of power, accompanied by a loud bang, which was heard by the crew and external witnesses, and by flames which were seen from the Control Tower. The bang and the loss of power occurred 4 seconds after the V1 speed call had been made. Two seconds after the bang, all four engines were retarded to idle and braking action was initiated. The aircraft crossed a small embankment and dropped approximately 4 metres onto the perimeter road, which caused it to break into three parts. It continued moving and subsequently came to a stop just before a 20 metre deep railway cutting was encountered. The Final Report was published on 10 July 2009 and found that “the accident was caused by the decision to reject the take-off 12 knots after passing V1 speed” and that “the following factors contributed to the accident: Number 3 engine experienced a bird strike, causing it to stall.. The aircraft lined up at the B1 intersection although the take-off parameters had been computed using the full length of the runway.. The limited situational awareness of the crew.. Less than maximum use of deceleration devices.. A RESA which, although it conforms to the applicable International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Standards, does not also conform to the ICAO Recommendation for length.”.
