Four Safety Recommendations were made: The Kalitta Air Fight Crew Training Program and related documentation should be modified for both initial and recurrent types qualification to highlight the risks involved in rejecting TO around V1, as well as the importance of respecting procedures.. The RESA for Runway 20 should be extended to the minimum length recommended by ICAO, either through physical extension or by the use of the EMAS system or by any other suitable means and that the case for applying this recommendation to other runways at Brussels and to runways at other Belgian Airports should be evaluated.. The Bird Control Unit at Brussels Airport should be reinforced with itsâ€™ leader being dedicated to the task. Bird Control Unit staff training should be improved to include all topics related to wild life in an airport environment and a request for a waiver for restrictions which currently apply to control by lethal methods should be considered.. The Belgian AIP should be revised to include the same requirement for flight crew to notify the Tower when the use of the full runway 20 length is required as applies for Runway 25R departures..
