On 12 April 2013, an Airbus A319 (VT-SCL) being operated by Air India on a scheduled international passenger flight from Abu Dhabi to Mumbai as AI 944 landed without clearance on runway 27 in day VMC after failing to respond to a TWR instruction to go around because the runway had been temporarily closed for an unscheduled runway inspection after a suspected departing aircraft bird strike. Two vehicles on the runway carrying out the inspection cleared it after their drivers saw the approaching aircraft and the landing was uneventful.
