The aircraft slid along the 3511 metre-long runway and stopped 326 metres from the end of it. An emergency evacuation followed as the AFS contained a fire risk at the damaged right engine which had supported the aircraft after the gear collapse. Although the aircraft sustained substantial damage, none of the 173 occupants of the aircraft were injured. The runway surface was damaged.
