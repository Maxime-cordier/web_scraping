An Investigation was carried out by the Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission of the State of the Operator, Jordan. The SSFDR and SSCVR were both removed from the aircraft and sent to the UAE GCAA AIS for download and relevant data were recovered from both. It was found that the 36 year-old Captain had a total of 5,078 flying hours almost all of which – 4,877 hours - were on type. He had joined the Operator in 2005 straight after initial flight training. The 29 year-old First Officer had a total of 3,380 flying hours almost all of which – 3,177 hours - were on type. He had joined the Operator in 2010. It was established that as the one hour flight from Herat neared Kabul, in VMC, the aircraft had been radar vectored onto an ILS approach to runway 29 and that the applicable Vref was 142 KIAS for an ELW (Expected Landing Weight) of 53,902 kg. The actual landing weight was subsequently calculated as having been 362 kg less than the MLW (Maximum Landing Weight) of 56,200 kg. It was noted that this had been a consequence of the considerable quantity of additional fuel above that required which had been carried on the sector. The Captain stated this had been on account of Kabul’s general history of “drastic weather changes” rather than as a specific response to the TAF available prior to departure from Herat. It was noted that the ILS GS on this approach was set at 3.5°, slightly higher than standard. The METAR timed shortly before the accident occurred included a mean surface wind velocity of 150°/09 knots, equivalent to a crosswind component of 6 knots from the left. CVR data showed that the final spot wind from ATC prior to touchdown was 190°/15 knots. However, FDR data showed that during the approach, there had been an average 7 knot tailwind component and an approximate 15 knot left crosswind component. With the benefit of FDR data analysis and flight crew statements, it was established that the aircraft had been configured for a flap 30 landing and the AP had been disconnected at 780 feet aal with the A/T remaining engaged for landing. It was estimated from available FDR data that the airspeed on final approach had been maintained at approximately 162 KIAS - around Vref + 20. The rate of descent between 159 feet agl and 115 feet agl was just above 1000 fpm which was sufficient to trigger a 2 second EGPWS ‘SINK RATE’ Alert to which the Captain responded with “continue”. The into wind left crab angle was nearly all removed at touchdown after a right rudder pedal input and touchdown occurred at approximately Vref+16 (158 KIAS) and at a ground speed of 178 knots. The runway threshold was crossed at 40 feet agl but main gear touchdown did not occur until 1067 metres along the runway and the recorded rate of descent at touchdown was only 58 fpm. The speedbrakes then deployed almost immediately
