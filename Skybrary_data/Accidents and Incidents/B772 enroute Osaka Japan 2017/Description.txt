On 23 September 2017, the crew of a Boeing 777-200 (PH-BQC) being operated by KLM on a scheduled international passenger flight from Kansai to Amsterdam as KL868 which had earlier passed over the city of Osaka in day VMC was advised that a large panel bearing evidence of a KLM paint scheme had fallen from the sky and hit a car being driven along a city street there. The panel was subsequently confirmed as likely to be from the aircraft and its crew were advised accordingly, but after checks showed no system abnormalities, they decided to complete the flight and subsequently did so without further event. Although the vehicle which had been hit sustained significant impact damage from the metre square panel, no occupant injury occurred.
