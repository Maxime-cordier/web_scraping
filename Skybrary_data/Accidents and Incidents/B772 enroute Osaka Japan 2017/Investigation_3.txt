the aircraft was climbing and passing over the city of Osaka after takeoff”. It was additionally determined in respect of the separation of the panel from the aircraft that it was “highly probable that the bracket that secured the panel’s forward upper corner by holding it to the airframe structure broke, a gap was created between the panel’s forward upper corner and the fuselage allowing the panel to separate due to the pressure of inflowing air and vibration”. Safety Action taken as a result of this event and known to the Investigation was noted as having included but not been limited to the following: KLM completed the replacement of the originally installed 198 panel brackets on all its 777 aircraft by the end of December 2017. Two brackets, each on a different aircraft, were found to be cracked. All aircraft were also checked for the presence of any more incorrect panel bolts but none were found. The airline’s maintenance facility also introduced “improved fastener cabinets” at their maintenance facilities to reduce the risk that incorrect bolts might be mixed in with the correct ones or taken in error.. Boeing issued an SB on 8 March 2018 which extended the scope of the previous two SBs for some -300 aircraft which had detailed the replacement of the originally-installed 198R panel brackets with the enhanced design to all -200 aircraft affected - line numbers 1 to 699 - which included the aircraft under investigation, line number 461.. The Final Report was adopted by the JTSB on 26 October 2018 and published on 29 November 2018. No Safety Recommendations were made.
