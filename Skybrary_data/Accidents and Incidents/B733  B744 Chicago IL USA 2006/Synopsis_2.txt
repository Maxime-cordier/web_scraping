moving up as the third departure aircraft [from runway 14R]. As I was determining the traffic flow, UAL1015 called 'ready'. I checked the [runway] 14R final out the window and there was nothing there. I scanned [runway] 27L from the departure end to the aircraft and there was nothing there. I checked the D-BRITE. I was checking the range on UAL938 to be sure he was far enough out on [runway] 14R to ensure I had the necessary wake turbulence separation for a [runway] 27L departure, and there was. Based on recall and hindsight, all this happened in about 3 or 4 seconds." At 0300:22, the SLC said, "United 1015, thank you, fly runway heading runway 27 left cleared for takeoff, wind one five zero at seven." The crew responded, "runway heading, cleared for takeoff United 1015. During the EFSTS' interview, he said he looked up and saw GTI6972 on landing roll on runway 14R at slow speed approaching taxiway T10. Although he was required to monitor the SLC frequencies, he did not and did not hear any communications between the SLC and any flight crews. He said he assumed GTI6972 was turning off at taxiway T10, because "it is very common". He looked left and saw out of the corner of his eye UAL1015 departing runway 27L. He looked back to GTI6972 and thought he might turn off on the next taxiway, M, to go to the NE cargo area then decided he was not. He then alerted the SLC." At 0301:12, the SLC said, "stop, stop, stop. According to the Captain of the B733 statement: "At that point, I did not feel that we would be able to abort and stop prior to those intersections (around 110-120 knots), so I decided to continue accelerating towards [GTI6972] and if needed, attempt to rotate over him. The other option was an abort and a right steer behind [GTI6972] to the north of runway 27L. Knowing there are substantial obstacles right of [runway] 27L, I felt that option would guarantee significant airframe damage and probably passenger injury. [GTI6972] continued encroaching on our runway, and it became clear that I would have to rotate early to clear it. By the time I rotated, [GTI6972] was fully on our runway. Vr at our weight was 143 kts, and I estimate I began the rotation 10 kts prior to Vr. The First Officer called V1 shortly after I started rotating. I flew a smooth rotation until we were airborne for fear of dragging the tail and delaying further rotation."
