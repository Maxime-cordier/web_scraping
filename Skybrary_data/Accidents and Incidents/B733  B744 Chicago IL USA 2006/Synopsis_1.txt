The National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB) Report on the Serious Incident provides the following description of the event: "At the time of the incident, the north local control (NLC) position was closed and the responsibilities were combined with south local control (SLC), located at the LC5 position in the ORD tower cab. The SLC was responsible for aircraft landing and departing runway 14R and departing runway 27L and used frequencies 120.75 and 126.9. Because of this configuration the ORD Standard Operating Procedures Order, ORD 7110.65E , required that either the Electronic Flight Strip Transfer System (EFSTS) position or Local Monitor (LMN) position be staffed to assist the SLC. The third local controller (LC3) was responsible for aircraft departing runway 22L and used frequency 132.7. SLC had several flight crews who had requested to depart from runway 14R for operational purposes. Because aircraft departing from runway 14R entered LC3's airspace, SLC was required to coordinate with LC3 for the release of those flights. SLC verbally coordinated the release of two departure aircraft, United Airlines (UAL) flight 938 and Air India (AI) flight 124, that he intended to depart before GTI6972 (Atlas Air) landed. At 0257:00, the SLC controller instructed UAL938 to taxi into position to hold on runway 14R. The crew acknowledged. At 0257:28, the flight crew of GTI6972 made initial contact with the ORD SLC and said, "hello tower, Giant 6972 heavy 9 D-M-E I-L-S one four right. The tower controller replied, "â€¦O'Hare tower, runway 14 right cleared to land. [Wind] one six zero at eight, traffic will depart ahead of your arrival." The flight crew read back the landing clearance. At 0257:50, the SLC cleared UAL938 for takeoff. At 0258:10, the SLC instructed UAL1015, "Traffic lands, departs, crossing, runway 27 left position and hold. The crew replied, "need about two minutes, UAL1015 if you could delay us in position that's fine." The SLC said, "UAL1015, let me know when you're ready, hold in position runway 27L." The crew acknowledged. According to the SLC's interview, he stated that at this time he determined there was not enough spacing to permit AI124 to depart from runway 14R prior to GTI6972's arrival. He walked to the LC3 controller and advised that he would not be departing the second airplane and would re-coordinate a release at a later time. At 0259:19, the SLC instructed UAL938 to contact departure control, which the crew acknowledged. At 0300:20, the crew of UAL1015 advised, "tower, United 1015, we're ready 27L." In his interview, the SLC said, "As this was happening, I looked to see what was on the third local controller's board to effectively coordinate the remaining departures from runway 14R. GTI6972 was the last arrival that was on the D-BRITE display so it allowed for a great deal of flexibility. Because of this flexibility, rather than cut off the [runway] 22L departures, I looked at his board to see what the best time to release his flights would be. I then saw an American B777
