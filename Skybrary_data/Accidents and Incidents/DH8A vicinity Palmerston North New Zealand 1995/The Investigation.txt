Several causal factors were identified by the investigation. They are divided in two sections. Crew related: The Captain did not ensure the aircraft’s engine power was adjusted correctly for the aircraft to intercept and maintain the approach profile.. The Captain’s lack of attention to, and/or mis-perception of, the aircraft’s altitude during the approach.. The pilots’ diversion from the primary task of flying the aircraft and ensuring its safety, by their endeavours to correct an undercarriage malfunction.. The Captain’s perseverance with his decision to attempt to get the undercarriage lowered without discontinuing the instrument approach in which he was engaged when the situation arose.. The absence of a requirement for cross-monitoring of the aircraft’s altitude while executing the QRH “Alternate Gear Extension” procedure.. The First Officer not executing the QRH procedure in the correct sequence, which distracted the Captain.. System related: The inadequate warning given by the GPWS.. A number of recommendations were issued. The addressees included the Chief Executive Officer of Ansett New Zealand, the Director of Civil Aviation New Zealand, Chief Executive of the Airways Corporation, Minister of Transport in Canada and the President of the New Zealand Air Line Pilots’ Association. The recommendations focus on: adequate crew training and supervision, breaking of approach in the event of abnormality, CAA operators’ audit adequacy, introduction of Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) functionality, provision of procedure to supply SAR services with any relevant radar information, changes in RTF used by approach controllers and finally “study to determine why the GPWS did not provide a greater degree of warning in the environment of the DHC-8 accident”
