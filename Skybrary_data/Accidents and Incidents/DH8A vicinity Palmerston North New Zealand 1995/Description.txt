On 9 June 1995 a de Havilland DHC-8-100 collided with terrain some 16 km east of Palmerston North aerodrome while carrying out a daytime instrument approach. The airplane departed Auckland as scheduled Ansett New Zealand flight 703 to Palmerston North airport. The aircraft was flown to join the 14 nm DME arc and thence turned right and intercepted the final approach track of 250°M to the Palmerston North VOR. The final approach track was intercepted at approximately 13 DME and 4700 feet. A few moments later the First Officer made a remark about the DME distance and altitude of the aircraft. Just at that moment the Captain said that the landing gear was not locked. He advised the First Officer to check the Quick Reference Handbook and stated “I’ll keep an eye on the aeroplane while you’re doing that.” The First Officer carried out the checklist with some discrepancies and the Captain provided some advise. The GPWS/TAWS audio alarm sounded just as the First Officer completed the procedure. Few seconds later the aircraft collided with the ground. One crew member and three passengers lost their lives and two crew members and 12 passengers were seriously injured in the accident.
