On 23 August 2017, a Boeing 767-400ER (N68061) being operated by United Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Zurich to Washington Dulles by an augmented crew was approaching FL 100 in unrecorded day flying conditions when the cabin altitude was seen to be increasing at an excessive rate and the climb was stopped at that level until it was believed that it had been possible to address the problem after which the climb was resumed. However as the aircraft approached FL 200, the same problem recurred and it was decided to don oxygen masks, declare a MAYDAY and commence an immediate descent to FL100 following which a return to Zurich was made without further event.
