On 25 July 2010, a Beech B200 Super King Air (F-OIAN) being operated by Air Alizé on a public transport flight transporting medical personnel from Nouméa-Magenta, New Caledonia to Nadi, Fiji touched down at destination with its landing gear in the unlocked transit position after flying a night Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) approach during which a significant electrical system failure had occurred. The landing gear retracted and the aircraft left the runway to the side and came to a stop resting on the fuselage with the propellers bent and flaps damage. The pilots and the two passengers on board were able to exit unaided. One runway edge light was destroyed.
