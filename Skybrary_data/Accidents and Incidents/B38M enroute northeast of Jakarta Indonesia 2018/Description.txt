On the morning of 29 October 2018, a Boeing 737-MAX 8 (PT-LQP) being operated by Indonesian carrier Lion Air on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta to Pangkal Pinang as LNI 610 impacted the sea northeast of Jakarta approximately 11 minutes after its daylight takeoff. The pilots had reported a flight control problem to ATC radar and had requested and initially begun a return to Jakarta because of it, but no declaration of urgency or emergency was made. Evidence indicating a high speed impact was found soon after the last recorded transmission to ATC. The aircraft was destroyed and none of the 189 occupants survived.
