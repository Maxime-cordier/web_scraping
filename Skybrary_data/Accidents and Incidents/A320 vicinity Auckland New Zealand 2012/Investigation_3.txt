well were not detected by the Maintenance Operation Control due to programming logic errors in the automated engine condition report system. However, even if they had been, it is unlikely that any subsequent action would have prevented the engine compressor stall event on landing at Auckland.. Wellington International Airport is providing an effective bird management programme that is keeping the risk of bird strikes as low as reasonably practicable.. No Safety Recommendations were made but the Commission formally noted the following two Key Lessons: Although the safety of the aeroplane and the persons on board was not unduly compromised by releasing the aeroplane to service knowing that a bird had been ingested into the core of one engine, operators will need to balance the cost of having inspection services available at key aerodromes into which they fly with the cost of an engine failure of this scale.. Even if the minimum mandatory checks are made to an engine that has suffered a bird strike down the core, if the aeroplane is released to service before the required full inspection has been undertaken, the pilots and ground engineering services should maintain increased vigilance of engine performance until the appropriate full maintenance checks can be completed.. The Final Report was approved for publication on 28 May 2015.
