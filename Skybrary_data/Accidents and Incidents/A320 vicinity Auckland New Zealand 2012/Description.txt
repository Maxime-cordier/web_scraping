On 20 June 2012, an Airbus A320 (ZK-OJQ) being operated by Air New Zealand on a domestic passenger flight from Wellington to Auckland experienced sudden surging of the right hand V2500 engine late on final approach at destination in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). The engine involved was set to idle and the intended landing was completed without further event with taxi-in accomplished using the remaining serviceable engine. On the previous flight, the aircraft had ingested a bird into the same engine when landing and was operating in accordance with an approved deferral of a required borescope check of the engine for one further flight.
