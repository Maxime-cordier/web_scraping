On 8 July 2005, a Boeing 737-400 (G-DOCT) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Aberdeen to London Heathrow was damaged during departure in daylight and normal ground visibility when jet efflux broke up the surface of the blast pad adjacent to the beginning of the paved surface of Runway 16 causing significant damage to the tailplane and elevator. The crew did not experience any unusual in flight effects as a result and only became aware of aircraft damage when advised after flight that it had been discovered during a routine engineering inspection.
