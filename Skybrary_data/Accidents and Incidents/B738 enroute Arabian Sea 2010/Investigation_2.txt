he stated that he had tried to leave his seat to open the door “but the aircraft pitch increased further and altitude was losing rapidly”. Then the commander gained access via the emergency entry process. It was noted that, once the aircraft was back at FL 370 and on the flight planned track, from which there had been a brief deviation during the altitude excursion, the rest of the flight had been uneventful. The Investigation found no evidence of any fluctuations in angle of attack, normal load factor or recorded wind velocity before or during the excursion which would have indicated the presence of relevant atmospheric disturbances. The Probable Cause was determined as “inadvertent handling of the control column in fully automated mode by the copilot which got compounded as he was not trained to recover the aircraft in automated mode”. It was further concluded that the Contributory Factor was the “subsequent recovery actions by the PIC without coordination with copilot”. Two Safety Recommendations were made as result of the Investigation: The appropriate action shall be taken against the involved crew.. In view of the incident, (the aircraft operator) should review the training curriculum including the simulator training of the pilots to include such in-flight emergencies.. The Final Report was completed on 6 August 2010 and published on 23 November 2010: Final Investigation Report on Serious Incident to AirIndia Charters ltd.
