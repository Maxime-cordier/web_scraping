On 13 December 2013, an Airbus A330-200 (PK-GPN) being operated by Garuda Indonesia on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Bali to Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta left the runway shortly after touchdown in heavy rain in daylight and continued parallel to the 60 metre-wide runway with the right main landing gear on the grass for 500 metres before regaining the runway. Resultant damage included a loss of hydraulic system integrity which meant that the aircraft was unable to taxi and it was towed to the parking gate. There were no injuries to the 198 occupants.
