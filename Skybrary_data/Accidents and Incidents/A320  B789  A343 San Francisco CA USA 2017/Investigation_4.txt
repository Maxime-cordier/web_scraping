lack of awareness of the parallel runway closure due to their ineffective review of NOTAM information before the flight and during the approach briefing”. Two Contributory Factors were also identified as follows: the flight crew’s failure to tune the ILS frequency for backup lateral guidance, expectation bias, fatigue due to circadian disruption and length of continued wakefulness, and breakdowns in CRM and. Air Canada’s ineffective presentation of approach procedure and NOTAM information.. A total of 7 Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation: that the Federal Aviation Administration work with air carriers conducting operations under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 to: assess all charted visual approaches with a required backup frequency to determine the flight management system auto-tuning capability within an air carrier’s fleet, identify those approaches that require an unusual or abnormal manual frequency input, and either develop an auto-tune solution or ensure that the manual tune entry has sufficient salience on approach charts.. assess all charted visual approaches with a required backup frequency to determine the flight management system auto-tuning capability within an air carrier’s fleet,. identify those approaches that require an unusual or abnormal manual frequency input, and. either develop an auto-tune solution or ensure that the manual tune entry has sufficient salience on approach charts.. that the Federal Aviation Administration establish a group of human factors experts to review existing methods for presenting flight operations information to pilots, including flight releases and general aviation flight planning services (pre-flight) and aircraft communication addressing and reporting system messages and other in-flight information; create and publish guidance on best practices to organise, prioritise, and present this information in a manner that optimises pilot review and retention of relevant information; and work with air carriers and service providers to implement solutions that are aligned with the guidance.. that the Federal Aviation Administration establish a requirement for airplanes landing at primary airports within class B and class C airspace to be equipped with a system that alerts pilots when an airplane is not aligned with a runway surface.. that the Federal Aviation Administration collaborate with aircraft and avionics manufacturers and software developers to develop the technology for a cockpit system that provides an alert to pilots when an airplane is not aligned with the intended runway surface and, once such technology is available, establish a requirement for the technology to be installed on airplanes landing at primary airports within class B and class C airspace.. that the Federal Aviation Administration modify airport surface detection equipment (ASDE) systems (ASDE-3, ASDE-X, and airport surface surveillance capability) at those locations where the system could detect potential taxiway landings and provide alerts to air traffic controllers about potential collision risks.. that the Federal Aviation Administration conduct human factors research to determine how to make a closed runway more conspicuous to pilots when at least one parallel runway remains in use, and implement a method to more effectively signal a runway closure to pilots during ground and flight operations at
