18 June 2010, a Boeing 737-800 being operated by Turkish operator Sun Express on a passenger flight from Prague to an unrecorded destination and taxiing for a full length departure from runway 06 at Prague was in collision in normal daylight ground visibility with an Airbus 321 being operated by Lufthansa on a passenger flight to an also-unrecorded destination which was waiting on a link taxiway leading to an intermediate take off position on the same runway. The two aircraft sustained damage to their right winglet and left horizontal stabiliser respectively but none of their respective 185 and 151 occupants were injured.
