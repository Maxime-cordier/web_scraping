On 8 May 1999 a Saab 340B being operated by American Eagle Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Baltimore/Washington International to New York JFK made an continuously unstabilised ILS approach to runway 04R in day Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and continued to a late touchdown at excessive speed before overrunning the end of the runway into the installed Engineered Materials Arresting System and coming to a stop within it. The aircraft sustained substantial damage and one of the 29 occupants was seriously injured whilst exiting the aircraft.
