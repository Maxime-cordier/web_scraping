that the deviation left of centreline was entirely due to the Captain’s rudder pedal input and unconnected with the existence of a crosswind component. It was noted that a nearby automatic wind velocity recording site was recording the equivalent of a mean 14 knot crosswind with little variation and could not be associated with the event. American Airlines examined their retained A321 OFDM takeoff data for more than 270,000 of their flights which had taken place between March 2018 and April 2019 looking only at the time interval between reaching an airspeed of 130 KCAS and reaching 50 feet agl. They found that: only one of these flights had recorded a higher maximum rudder deflection but more than 2,300 of them had operated with a higher crosswind component than the accident aircraft.. the heading deviation of the accident aircraft during its takeoff roll was more than three times that of the next highest deviation.. the duration of a rudder application greater than 50% in accident aircraft was more than that for any other such flight.. several other flights had been exposed to larger crosswind components - up to 43 knots in gusts - but none had recorded either the maximum rudder deflection or the duration of rudder application reached by the accident flight.. the duration of rudder input was compared with the maximum rudder deflection greater than 50% between 0.5 second before rotation and 0.5 second after liftoff. This found that the accident flight had both a greater maximum rudder deflection and a longer rudder input than any other flight.. The Investigation determined that the Probable Cause of the accident was "the Captain’s excessive left rudder pedal input during the takeoff ground roll, which caused a large heading deviation and a left roll upon rotation that resulted in the left wingtip striking the ground". The Final Report was published on 22 July 2012. No Safety Recommendations were made.
