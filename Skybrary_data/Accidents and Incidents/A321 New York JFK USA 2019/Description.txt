On 10 April 2019, an Airbus A321 (N114NN) being operated by American Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from New York JFK to Los Angeles was about to become airborne in normal night visibility when it rolled sharply left before returning to wings level. After takeoff, a report of a dented left wingtip was received from the cabin and the crew decided to return although when asked by the controller if the situation was an emergency, a negative response followed. A landing without further event was made just under half an hour later following which part of a runway edge marker was found lodged in the left wingtip. Damage to the aircraft was substantial and it was found not to be economically repairable but there were no injuries to the 110 occupants.
