In late July 2011, a body called the "Polish Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents" published an English language version of their own Final Report into the accident. It should be noted that this body is entirely separate from the Państwowa Komisja Badania Wypadków Lotniczych (PKBWL) which is the designated civil air accident investigation agency for Poland and is constituted as a division of the Ministry of Infrastructure.
