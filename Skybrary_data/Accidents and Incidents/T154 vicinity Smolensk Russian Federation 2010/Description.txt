On 10 April 2010, a Tupolev Tu-154M was being operated by the Polish Air Force Special Transport Regiment on a pre-arranged VIP fight for the Polish President and his entourage on a flight from Warsaw to Smolensk Severny, a Russian military aerodrome not normally available for use by international flights. During a ‘trial approach’ at destination by day in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) with thick fog reported at the aerodrome, the aircraft impacted ground obstacles and terrain below the level of the landing runway both some distance away from it and off the extended centreline. As a result of the impact and subsequent fire, the aircraft was destroyed and all occupants were killed.
