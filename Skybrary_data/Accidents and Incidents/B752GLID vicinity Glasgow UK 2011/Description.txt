On 23 July 2011, a Boeing 757-200 being operated by Thomson AW on a passenger flight from Verona Italy to Glasgow was involved in a near miss with a Discus Glider whilst descending through 3450 feet QNH in Class ‘E’ airspace east of Glasgow and under radar control in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). The glider was working a local aerodrome frequency and had been observed intermittently on radar but with insufficient continuity to do other than to provide a general alert to the 757.
