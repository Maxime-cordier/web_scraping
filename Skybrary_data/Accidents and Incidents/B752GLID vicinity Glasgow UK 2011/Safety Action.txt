As a result of the occurrence, and whilst the formal Investigation was still being concluded, the CAA Director of Airspace Policy (DAP), considering that “a safety critical risk existed” within the existing Glasgow Class ‘E’ CTA where the conflict had occurred, authorised an interim reclassification of this airspace from Class ‘E to Class ‘D’ to take effect on 16 September 2011. The formal statement of Cause was given as: “A conflict between IFR and VFR traffic in Class E airspace, resolved by the B757 crew.” The ICAO AIRPROX Risk Category (the actual risk after any avoiding action) was assessed as ‘B’. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 26 October 2011. In the light of the Safety Action already taken, no Safety Recommendations were made.
