direction) EVA Air Boeing 777 at FL320 and the 747 and the controller responded by instructing the 747 to turn left onto 090°. This PCW was then quickly followed by another between the 747 and the KLM 777 at FL 330 just as the controller was instructing the EVA Air 777 to turn left onto 270°, an instruction which did not elicit any response. The PCW between the 747 and KLM 777 then momentarily ceased before recurring, this time continuing for 2 minutes and 14 seconds. Soon after this had restarted, the EVA Air 777 crew acknowledged the earlier instruction and commenced the left turn. The controller then again instructed the 747 to take up a 090° heading and this time added an instruction to descend to FL 320 which were both acknowledged. About half a minute later, another PCW was activated between the EVA Air 777 and the 747. Both continuing PCWs (747/KLM 777 and 747/EVA Ait 777) then ceased as 10nm lateral radar separation was re-established. In summary, the Investigation found that during the event, the standard lateral and vertical separation of 10 nm and 1000 feet respectively had been reduced to 5.87 nm and 600 feet between the 747 and the EVA Air 777 and to 1.84 nm and zero feet respectively between the 747 and the KLM 777. However, it was noted that none of these aircraft reported having received a TCAS RA to ATC. It was also noted that no instructions had been given to the KLM 777 which had continued as cleared at FL 330. It was observed that the controllers use of plain language rather than standard phraseology when responding to the 747s request to climb to FL 390 had facilitated the incorrect response of the 747 crew and that the nature of their readback when advised of the ‘availability’ of FL 350 clearly indicated that it may have been understood as a clearance, an incorrect assumption which had then been reinforced by the controllers “standby for higher” since this was capable of being understood as standby for the originally requested FL390 having received an initial clearance to FL 350. It was also considered that whilst the Captains intervention from his observer seat “may have increased separation” there had been no explanation of why this exceptional action had been necessary and some concern about the risk therefrom. The Probable Cause of the event was determined as “the (controller’s) incorrect use of plain language while passing information to aircraft, which led to ‘confirmation bias’ and incorrect understanding of his advisory communication by the 747 crew”. A Contributory Factor was also identified as “the lack of situational awareness amongst the 747 crew”. Three Safety Recommendations were made as follows: that the Airport Authority of India should apprise its Controllers regarding the use of standard phraseology and correct use of plain language whilst on duty.. that the Airport Authority of India should ensure that radar data is preserved and made available to the AAIB for investigations
