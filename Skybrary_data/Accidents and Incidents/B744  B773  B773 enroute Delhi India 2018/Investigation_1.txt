A Serious Incident Investigation was carried out by the Indian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) in accordance with the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules 2017. Only ATC recorded radar and communications data were available and details of the experience of the pilots involved was only obtained for the National Air Cargo 747 flight crew. This flight’s augmented crew consisted of a Captain and two First Officers. The Captain had a total of 16,056 hours flying experience of which 2,746 hours were on type. He had previously been P1 rated on the Boeing 777 and several narrow body and business aircraft types. The two First Officers had total flying experience of 3,681 hours and 3,176 hours with a respective 102 hours and 617 hours of these totals being on type. It was established that the Boeing 747 was maintaining FL 310 southeast bound on ATS route M890, an RNP10 route which runs from the Afghanistan border to the north and then west of Delhi. A Boeing 777-300 was tracking in the same direction at FL 330 almost above the 747. Another 777-300 was on the same route travelling in the opposite direction at FL 320 and to the southeast of the other two aircraft. All traffic involved in the investigated loss of separation was working the Delhi ACC East sector on frequency 124.55 MHz. Editor’s Note: the AIP INDIA states that ATC will apply 50 nm longitudinal separation minima between suitably equipped aircraft at the same level on ATS route M890 within the Delhi FIR. The 747 crew requested a climb to FL 390 and when the controller responded with “Level available 350”, the crew replied “Roger 350” to which the controller, aware that the KLM 777 travelling in the same direction was just above the 747, responded with “standby for higher”. According to the 747 crew, the Captain had just taken a break and his left side seat had been taken by the relief First Officer as PM. Following the R/T exchange, the PF First Officer initiated a climb after wrongly assuming that a clearance to do so had been given and had reached FL 331 when, a little later, the Captain returned to the flight deck. After taking the right side observer seat, he reported having “observed a converging aircraft”. This led him to instruct the operating crew to “descend and turn left” but when he considered that their response to this instruction was too slow, he had reached out from his seat and disconnected the AP and A/T, reduced thrust and initiated the left turn. It was reported that during this manoeuvre, the aircraft had encountered wake turbulence from the other aircraft and the Captain had decided that they should level off at FL 325 to keep clear of other traffic.
