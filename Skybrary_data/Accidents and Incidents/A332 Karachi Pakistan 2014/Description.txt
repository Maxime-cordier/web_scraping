On 4 October 2014, an Airbus A330-200 (A6-EAQ) being operated by Emirates Airline on a scheduled passenger flight from Karachi to Dubai as EK609 was pushing back from stand at Karachi in normal night visibility when a hydraulic system fault was annunciated and soon afterwards, dense hydraulic mist entered both the passenger cabin and the flight deck via the aircraft air conditioning system. After a short delay, during which the fumes in the passenger cabin worsened and a Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE) unit caught fire when one of the cabin crew attempted to use it, the aircraft was towed back onto stand where an emergency evacuation of all occupants was completed. Minor injuries were sustained by 7 of the 12 cabin crew and 1 of the 68 passengers. The only damage to the aircraft was in the area where the PBE unit had caught fire.
