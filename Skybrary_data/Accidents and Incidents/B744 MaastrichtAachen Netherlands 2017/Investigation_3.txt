confirmation that he had indeed been holding and using the tiller throughout the event and his failure to keep his right hand on the thrust levers until reaching V1 as required by SOP which had directly contributed to the delay in initiating a rejected takeoff until it was too late. Overall, it was surmised that the failure of the Captain to initiate a timely rejected takeoff may have been partly attributable to the delay in response to unexpected events attributable to the effect of “startle” as well as to the fact that his noise cancelling headset had prevented him hearing the noise of the compressor stall and his First Officer had not identified and communicated the nature of the failure. Since even a sudden failure of a single engine on the aircraft type involved would not qualify on its own as a ‘Serious Incident’, the Investigation did not seek a detailed explanation of the cause of the engine 4 failure. However, some of the necessary engine strip down and repair work at the operator’s maintenance facility was observed and a number of removed High Pressure Compressor (HPC) components were examined by investigators to see if there was any evidence of a specific cause for the compressor stall. None was found and it was concluded that minor damage to the HPC blades was within AMM limits and had not precluded continued operation of the aircraft. The Cause of the runway excursion was formally documented as “the pilot’s inability to maintain directional control under the conditions of prolonged asymmetric thrust that resulted from the loss of thrust on engine #4 at low speed due to a compressor stall”. Two Contributory Factors were also identified as follows: The thrust levers were not retarded immediately after the loss of thrust (such delays and not following trained procedures have been associated with the phenomenon known as ‘startle effect’).. During training courses in flight simulators, the lessons learned from unexpected situations, such as engine failures, are quite limited as the crews know what to expect.. The Final Report was published on 16 March 2020.
