On 2 July 2008, a Boeing 737-700 being operated by Air Tran Airways on domestic scheduled passenger flight from Baltimore to Seattle-Tacoma had, in normal ground visibility at night, failed to hold clear of runway 34R during taxi in after landing on runway 34C at destination and had passed almost directly underneath a North West Airlines Airbus 330-200 which had just become airborne on a flight to London Heathrow.
