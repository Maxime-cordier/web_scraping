On 7 September 2006, a Cessna 551 Citation, operated by Triple Alpha Luftfahrtgesellschaft, in normal visibility conditions entered the active runway at Oslo Gardermoen Airport, Norway without a valid ATC clearance. As result of the runway incursion, the ATC instructed a Boeing 737-800 to reject its take off thereby removing the risk of collision.
