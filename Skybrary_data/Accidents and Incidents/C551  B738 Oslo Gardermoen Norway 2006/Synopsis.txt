The following extract is from the official Report by the Aircraft Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) on the Serious Incident: "[â€¦] CLU8000 (C551) was cleared to holding position C1 for RWY 01L. SNB611T (B738) was given line-up clearance for RWY 01L at 07:47:25, and take-off clearance at 07:48:19. As SNB611T commenced the take-off roll, the air traffic controller observed that CLU8000 had passed beyond holding position C1 and was about to enter RWY 01L. The air traffic controller immediately instructed SNB611T to abort the take-off, which was complied with."
