On 25 July 2021, a Boeing 737-800 (SE-RPE) being operated by Norwegian Air Sweden on a scheduled passenger flight from Copenhagen to Nice as NAX 3646 was unable to avoid briefly penetrating a storm cell during a descent previously conducted in day VMC. One unsecured member of the cabin crew sustained a serious injury and another a minor one. The flight was completed without further event and landed at its destination twenty minutes later where both injured cabin crew were taken to hospital.
