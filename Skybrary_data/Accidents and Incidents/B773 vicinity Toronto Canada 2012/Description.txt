On 28 May 2012, a Boeing 777-300ER powered by GE90 engines and being operated by Air Canada on a scheduled passenger flight from Toronto to Tokyo Narita experienced sudden failure of the right engine on the initial climb after take off in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). There were no indications of any associated engine fire and so the failed engine was secured, an emergency declared to ATC and an uneventful return to land made after fuel jettison to reduce landing weight to the maximum permitted. Debris ejected from the exhaust of the failed engine fell onto and damaged several vehicles on the ground but no injuries from this falling debris were reported.
