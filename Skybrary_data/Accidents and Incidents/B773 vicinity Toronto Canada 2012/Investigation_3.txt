in order to evaluate the condition of the remaining engines affected by SB 72-0401 and establish appropriate prioritisation for their removal and repair. This assessment included the way in which engine pairing was permitted as a means to reduce the probability of a double engine failure. After completing this work and evaluating the results, it was decided to reduce the number of cycles between BSIs by 50% or more from the schedule contained in SB 72-0401.. The FAA issued an AD 2013-17-07 in respect of borescope inspections GE90 engines fitted with a specific P/N range of Stage 1 HPT Stator Shrouds which was effective from 18 October 2013. This AD required the use of specified GE90-100 SBs as guidance for the inspection procedures and to determine if any shroud hole dimensions made the inspected engine unacceptable for continued service.. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release by the Board on 6 November 2013 and officially released on 13 December 2013.
