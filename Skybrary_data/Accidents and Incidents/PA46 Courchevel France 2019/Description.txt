On 8 February 2019, a Piper PA46-350P (F-GUYZ) being privately operated for commercial air transport purposes on a non-scheduled IFR domestic flight taking three ticketed business passengers from Toussus-le-Noble to Courchevel failed to stop before reaching the end of the destination landing runway after a day VMC approach was followed by a late touchdown. It then collided with a snow bank resulting in damage to aircraft but the five occupants were uninjured.
