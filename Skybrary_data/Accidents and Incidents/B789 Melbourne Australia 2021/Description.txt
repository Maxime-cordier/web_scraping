On 22 September 2021, a Boeing 787-9 (VH-ZNJ) being operated by Qantas Airways on a non-scheduled international cargo flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles completed an uneventful flight to its destination where it was discovered that tape covering four fan cowl static ports had not been removed before the aircraft departed. No safety-related consequences of this oversight were detected in flight but it was considered that an Investigation was required to establish such consequences and establish how the oversight had occurred to ensure repetition could be avoided.
