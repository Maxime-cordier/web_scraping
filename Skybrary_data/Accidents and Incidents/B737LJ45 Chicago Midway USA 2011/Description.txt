On 1 December 2011, a Boeing 737-700 being operated by Southwest AL on a scheduled passenger flight from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Chicago Midway was cleared to cross runway 31R in normal daylight visibility after landing on runway 31C at the same time as a Gama Charters Learjet 45 was taking off from runway 31R on a scheduled passenger flight to Savannah GA. Following a late sighting of the Learjet by the 737 crew and their immediate avoiding action, the two aircraft came into close proximity as the Learjet passed nearly overhead the 737. None of the respective 79 and 6 occupants of the two aircraft were injured.
