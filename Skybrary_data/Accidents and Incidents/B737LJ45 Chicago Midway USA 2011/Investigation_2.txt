not sounded an alarm during the conflict. The NTSB determined the Probable Cause of the event to be: “The Tower local controller did not ensure that the runway was clear of conflict before directing the B737 to cross the runway and other air traffic control personnel did not effectively intervene when the separation between the two airplanes became questionable.” Information recorded on the Investigation Docket included the finding that the investigated error was the third ‘Operational Error’ by the Controller involved within six months. The previous two events had been lining up an aircraft for take off on a runway with an aircraft on approach and a take off clearance issued whilst another aircraft was crossing the same runway. The Final Report OPS12IA167B was released on 11 July 2012. No Safety Recommendations were made.
