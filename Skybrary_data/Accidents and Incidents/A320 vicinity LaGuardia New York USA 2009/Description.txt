On 15 January 2009, 3000 feet agl after a daytime take-off in VMC from LaGuardia Airport, NY, an Airbus A320-200 experienced an almost complete loss of thrust after encountering a flock of Canada Geese and ingesting birds in both engines. It was subsequently ditched in the Hudson River about 8.5 miles from airport. The ditching was completed successfully. Of the 150 occupants, one member of cabin crew and four passengers were seriously injured and the aircraft was substantially damaged, although later recovered for investigation purposes.
