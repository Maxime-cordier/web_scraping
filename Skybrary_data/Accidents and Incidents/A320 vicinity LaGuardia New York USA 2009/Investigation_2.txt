Database, the accident was not a typical bird-strike event. Since 1960, 26 large-transport aircraft have been destroyed because of bird strikes worldwide, and 93 percent of these strikes occurred during takeoff or landing at an altitude of about 500 feet agl or less when the airplane was still near an airport. In contrast, the accident airplane struck birds at an altitude of about 2,800 feet agl about 4.3 miles from LaGuardia, a much higher altitude and further away from an airport than most strikes occur. According to the wildlife-strike data, the fewest bird strikes in the United States are reported in the winter months, including January, and, in the New York City area, January is one of three months with the historically lowest number of strikes involving Canada geese. Strike data for all wildlife species indicate that the second fewest bird strikes are reported in January. Therefore, the accident event occurred in a month not typically associated with high bird-strike probability.
