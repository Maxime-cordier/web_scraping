On 16 March 2020, a Bombardier DHC8-400 (VH-QOE) being operated by Sunstate Airlines for owner Qantas Airways on a scheduled Qantas Link international passenger flight from Port Moresby to Cairns as QF713 had only just taken off when abnormal fumes and later visible ‘smoke’ became apparent in the cabin and the flight deck. When these continued to intensify as the climb continued, it was decided to declare a ‘PAN’ and return to Port Moresby and the climb was stopped at FL190. The return was without further developments but once clear of the landing runway, a precautionary rapid disembarkation was carried out because of some passengers’ breathing difficulties.
