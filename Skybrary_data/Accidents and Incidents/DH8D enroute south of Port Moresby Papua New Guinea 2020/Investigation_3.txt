(in accordance with SB 35341) an improved seal was being substituted at replacement. At the time of the investigated event, the engine involved had been in service for 9,211 hours since new and on the basis of the engine performance based on routine Engine Condition Trend Monitoring (ECTM) and borescope inspection, overhaul of the engine had been scheduled for four months after the seal failure. In the light of these findings, the Investigation was concerned that in practice, the degree of exposure to environmental conditions “cannot be monitored or measured” and also the seemingly low likelihood that any secondary signs would indicate that a failure of the seal in service was imminent. Further concern derived from the fact that, according to the applicable Service Bulletin, the conditions for the replacement of the carbon seal were that the engine has been disassembled which can only occur during overhaul. This fact meant that continued use of the subject seal could occur without implementing the Service Bulletin and without any mention of the possible minimum in service failure time. Discussion - Non Airworthiness Issues It was noted that although the Operator’s ‘Aircrew Emergency Procedure Manual’ stated that “fumes caused by oil contaminated bleed air have been described as having a strong odour similar to ‘dirty socks’ and possibly visually a blue smoke, haze or mist”, this association had not been made by the SCCM or apparently recognised by the Captain although they had distributed surgical masks they had on board for other purposes to three passengers who had requested masks and had also distributed some wet towelettes to all passengers as per the smoke inhalation prevention procedures in the same Manual.. The intentional decision of the Captain not to follow the bleed air fumes tracing procedure by not selecting the left engine bleed air on before also turning the right bleed air off meant that the pilots were “not able to isolate the origin of the fault and continue with the applicable steps required by the checklist to avoid unnecessary effects on safety”.. An assessment of relevant ATC communications found that although Moresby Radar, who had received and acknowledged the flight’s PAN call had informed Airport Radar to whom the flight was subsequently transferred of this status, the latter had not done the same when transferring the flight to the TWR frequency and when the TWR then asked for “more information about the emergency situation” such clarification had not been provided. Although this had not added to the flight time, it had led to the PAN traffic having to insist that they receive priority for landing rather than be delayed to allow other traffic to join final ahead of them.. The Contributing Factors to the event were, in summary, as follows: The smoke/fumes that entered the cabin through the bleed air system originated from oil liberated at the No.3 bearing carbon seal of the PW150 engine coming into contact with hot surfaces inside the engine.. The wear-out and early fracture of the air
