On 27 July 2021, an Airbus A320 (9V-JSM) being operated by JetStar Asia on a scheduled international passenger flight from Singapore Changi to Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta took off uneventfully from runway 20L in normal night visibility despite crew recognition that some runway lighting was not on. ATC were not advised of this by the crew until after the flight was airborne after which all lighting was selected on.
