On 23 September 2012, a Boeing 737-300 being operated by Thomsonfly on a passenger flight from Faro to Bournemouth UK made a go around in night Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) from its first approach at destination which was subsequently found to have involved a temporary loss of control before recovery was achieved. The approach and landing which followed were successful and without further abnormal occurrence. None of the 137 occupants were injured as a consequence of the extreme manoeuvres which occurred.
