as a fire.. If ground crew on the apron are not trained to manage passengers following an evacuation, there is risk of injury both for evacuated passengers and ground crew.. If an airport operator's safety management system does not include monitoring the service providers working on the apron, there is a risk that inadequate procedures or equipment will be used or that personnel will not be sufficiently trained.. If ground service equipment does not have emergency stop buttons, there is a risk of injury not only for evacuated passengers but also for ground crew.. If passengers take their carry-on baggage with them during an emergency evacuation, this could prevent the evacuation from proceeding smoothly and quickly as well as damage the evacuation slides, thereby increasing the risk of injury.. Safety Action taken as a result of the occurrence was recorded as including the following: Servisair inspected the fuel systems of all their belt loaders in Canada and installed an emergency stop switch on all their belt loaders that did not already have one. They also amended the maintenance program checklist for the belt loader model involved to include a specific inspection of the filter regulator and its associated lines, connectors and fixing rings.. Aéroports de Montréal reported that "some service providers such as ground handlers" had since been incorporated into their SMS and that the Airport Fire Service was now offering training to all staff working airside.. TUG Technologies Corporation issued a Bulletin to all of its customers giving preventive maintenance instructions on how to check the fuel lines and their fittings and is now also installing their belt loaders with an emergency stop button positioned at each location where there are operator controls.. The Final Report was authorised for release on 28 January 2015 and officially released on 3 February 2015. No Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation.
