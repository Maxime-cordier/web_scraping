a speed of 160 KCAS, separation from the Boeing 717, which was maintaining a similar speed but accelerating relative to the CRJ700 ahead, was approximately 1nm horizontally and 920 feet vertically behind it. As the 717 approached overhead the end of the runway, still slowly accelerating and now 840 feet above the CRJ700, it began to deviate to the left of the runway centreline in accordance with the selected heading at the same time as the CRJ began to deviate very slightly to the right of the extended centreline. At this point (marked 5 in the illustration below), the TWR controller instructed the much slower CRJ700, which was already cleared to continue climb to 6000 feet, to turn left and the 717 to “immediately turn right onto heading 050°”. As the CRJ700 began turning at 2,100 feet, the horizontal and vertical separation between the two aircraft was 0.6nm and 300 feet respectively with the 717 about to level at 2500 feet and the CRJ700 about to climb rapidly through the same altitude. The ground track and vertical profile of the two aircraft involved annotated with numbered positions showing the concurrent positions of the 717 (red) and the CRJ700 (blue). [Reproduced from the Official Report] The TWR Controller then instructed the CRJ700 to stop climb at 2000 feet which it had already exceeded with a 1300 fpm rate of climb. Seconds later, (at point 7 on the illustration above) coordinated TCAS RAs were annunciated on board both aircraft and actioned by the crews. The 717 RA received a ‘DESCEND’ RA and the CRJ700 received a ‘MAINTAIN CLIMB’ RA with the vertical separation between them just 50 feet when 740 metres apart horizontally. The CRJ700 RA changed almost immediately to ‘INCREASE CLIMB’ with the respective separations at 95 feet and 520 metres and the minimum horizontal separation of 315 metres was reached ten seconds after annunciation of the RAs with the vertical separation now increasing through 500 feet. ‘Clear of Conflict’ annunciations then occurred with the two aircraft on divergent tracks and with increasing vertical separation as the CRJ700 continued its climb. The TWR Controller then transferred both flights to the APP radar frequency. The 717 crew stated that as they began their go around, they had been expecting an instruction to turn right in order to avoid conflict with the departing CRJ700, which they knew could be expected to turn left whilst climbing according to the applicable SID and were surprised when they were instructed to continue straight ahead to 2,500 feet. The Captain stated that he had not understood the controller’s instructions to the CRJ700 given in French and expressed surprise that “in a potential conflict situation, the exchanges were not carried out in a shared language, in English only". Neither of the pilots had visual contact with the CRJ700 until after the RA occurred and first saw the CRJ700 as it passed directly in front of them in a left hand climbing turn. They considered that “the situation was
