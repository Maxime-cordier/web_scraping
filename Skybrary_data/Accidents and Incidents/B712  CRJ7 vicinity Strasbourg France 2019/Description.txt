On 12 April 2019, a Boeing 717-200 (EI-EXB) being operated by Volotea on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Montpelier to Strasbourg and a Bombardier CRJ 700 (F-GRZG) being operated by HOP! on scheduled domestic passenger flight from Strasbourg to Marseilles came into extremely close proximity in day VMC as the 717 was going around from an approach to runway 05 and the CRJ700 was climbing after takeoff from the same runway. Minimum lateral separation of 740 metres occurred as the two aircraft, without prior visual contact, came within 50 feet of each other vertically when only 740 feet apart laterally. All CRJ crew members stated that they had been aware of the near miss and the junior member of the cabin crew became unfit to continue their duties upon hearing the Captains summary account shortly after the event.
