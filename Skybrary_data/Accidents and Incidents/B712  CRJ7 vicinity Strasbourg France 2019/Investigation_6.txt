departing aircraft so that landing clearances are given sufficiently early and the risk of a low-level go around is limited. [FRAN 2020-013]. The Investigation also identified Two ‘Safety Lessons’ as follows: One of the tasks of the airport controller is to “expedite and maintain an orderly flow of air traffic”. He may do this by approaching the regulatory minima when this is necessary, but this should not be done systematically due to the ensuing risk of exceeding them. Thus, the optimisation of the use of the runway and the search for operational efficiency must not take precedence over the prevention of collisions which requires the controller to continuously carry out a strategic analysis of the risks..
