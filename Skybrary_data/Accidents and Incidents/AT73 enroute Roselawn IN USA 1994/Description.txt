On 31 October 1994, an ATR 72-212 (N401-AM) being operated by Simmons Airlines (a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines' holding company AMR Corporation) on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Indianapolis to Chicago O'Hare as American Eagle 4184 was descending through 9100 feet QNH in day Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and experienced a sudden, severe and sustained roll upset from which the crew were unable to recover. Uncontrolled descent ended in ground impact at an extremely high rate of descent which completely destroyed the aircraft and killed all 68 occupants.
