transferring with it to the ATR72 eighteen months prior to the accident. The Captain had accumulated a total of 7867 flying hours including 1548 hours on the ATR72 and the First Officer had accumulated a total of 5176 flying hours including 3657 hours on the ATR72. The First Officer had been PF for the accident flight. Subsequent to the accident, the NTSB recommended that the FAA conduct a Special Certification Review (SCR) of the ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft and that "flight tests and/or wind tunnel tests be conducted as part of that review to determine the aileron hinge moment characteristics of the airplanes while operating at different airspeeds and in different configurations during ice accumulation and with varying AoA following ice accretion". The conclusions of this review were that both aircraft types had been correctly certificated in accordance with 14 CFR parts 21 and 25 and JAR 25 but that the accident aircraft exposure to icing appeared to have included Supercooled Water Droplets (SWD) in the size range of about 40 to 400, droplets defined by the SCR team as Supercooled Drizzle Drops (SCDD). The team considered that "while the physics of formation are not the same, freezing drizzle and SCDD can be considered to present the same icing threat in terms of adverse effects" with the difference between them being only that the description "freezing drizzle" refers to precipitation at the surface whereas SCDD "is found aloft with air at temperatures above freezing underneath". It was concluded that "while the effects of ice accreted in SLD may be severe, the clouds that produce them tend to be localized in horizontal and/or vertical extent". The Investigation noted that Freezing Rain/Drizzle - and therefore their in-cloud SWD equivalents, occur in circumstances not covered by the Part 25 'Appendix C' Icing Envelope and observed that "no airplane should be authorized or certified for flight into icing conditions more severe than those to which the airplane was subjected in certification testing, unless the manufacturer can otherwise demonstrate the safety of flight in such conditions". It noted that "had the FAA acted more positively upon" NTSB Safety Recommendations issued to the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research in their 1981 Report on 'Aircraft Icing Avoidance and Protection', the accident "may not have occurred". It was concluded that ice-induced aileron hinge moment reversals, autopilot disconnects and rapid, un-commanded rolls can occur if ATR 42 or 72 aircraft are operated in the presence of SWD with the Median Volume Diameter (MVD) typical of freezing drizzle. Whilst the 60 lb force on the control column which would have been required to maintain a wings-level attitude at the initiation of the aileron hinge moment reversal which affected the accident aircraft was within FAA requirements, the rapid, un-commanded rolls and the sudden onset of a requirement for such large corrective forces without any prior warning for the pilot or, in this case, any training for such unusual events, would not be conducive to a timely
