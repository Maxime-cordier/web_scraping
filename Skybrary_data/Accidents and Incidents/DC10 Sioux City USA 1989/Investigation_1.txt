An Investigation into the accident was carried out by the NTSB. Both flight recorders were recovered from the wreckage. The CVR data covered the final 33Â½ minutes of the flight beginning about 10 minutes after the number 2 engine failed. The FDR was undamaged with no evidence of excessive damage and it was found to contain a full 25 hours of recorded data. However, although the quality of the data recording was generally good, there were some anomalies in the data. Available parameters included altitude, indicated airspeed, heading, pitch attitude, roll attitude, stabiliser position, fan rotor speed (N1) for each engine, position of control surfaces and longitudinal, lateral and vertical acceleration. Photographs taken as the aircraft was approaching Sioux City showed that the fan cowling and the fuselage tail cone of the failed number 2 engine were missing but that the rest of the engine appeared to be intact. An initial examination of the wreckage found that the fan rotor components of the failed engine forward of the fan shaft and part of the shaft itself had separated from the engine in flight. The progressive breakup of the aircraft after its first runway contact began immediately as the right wing broke and the final disposition of the various separated parts of the aircraft ended up as shown in the illustration below. Debris which was ejected from the engine at the time of the failure and fell to the ground but did not cause any personal injury or significant damage, and damage to airport facilities at Sioux City was negligible. The 57 year-old Captain had a total of 29,967 flying hours which included 7,190 hours on type with all his experience being gained whilst employed by United Airlines which he joined in 1956. After experience as a First Officer on the Boeing 727, he qualified as a DC10 First Officer and then returned to the 727 as a Captain in 1985 before transferring back to the DC10 as a Captain in 1987. The 48 year-old First Officer had a total of approximately 20,000 flying hours which included 665 hours on type. He had been employed by United Airlines since 1985, having previously been employed by National Airlines and then Pan American World Airways. The 51 year-old Second Officer had a total of approximately 15,000 flying hours which included 33 hours on type. He had been employed by United Airlines since 1986 and prior to a recent move to the DC10 had been a Second Officer on the Boeing 727. The 46 year-old off-duty Training Captain who assisted the duty flight crew in tackling the emergency and in particular manipulated the thrust levers of the two remaining engines to successfully achieve rudimentary flight path control had joined United Airlines in 1968 after service in the Air National Guard where he had accumulated between 1,400 and 1,500 total flying hours. His total experience on the DC10 since qualifying on type in 1978 was 2,987 hours comprised of 1,943 hours as a Second Officer,
