On 19 July 1989, a Douglas DC-10-10 (N1819U) being operated by United Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Denver to Chicago Oâ€™Hare was in the cruise at FL370 in day VMC when about an hour after takeoff, a loud explosion was heard and it was apparent that the number 2 (tail-mounted) engine had failed. It was soon clear that there had been a complete failure of hydraulic power, which resulted in the inability to operate any of the primary flight control surfaces. An emergency was declared and radar vectors to Sioux City offered by ATC and accepted. With the assistance of an off duty DC-10 Training Captain who managed to control the flight path by manipulating the thrust on engines 1 and 3, the aircraft was able to approach a runway at Sioux City on which an emergency landing was attempted. Soon after the right main gear and wingtip contacted the only practicable (but officially closed) runway, the aircraft rolled inverted and was progressively destroyed by the impact and fire. 111 of the 296 occupants were killed, 47 sustained serious injuries, 125 sustained minor injuries and 13 were uninjured.
