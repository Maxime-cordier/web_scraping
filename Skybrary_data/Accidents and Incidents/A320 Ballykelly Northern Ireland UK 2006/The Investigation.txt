The Investigation was carried out by the UK AAIB. Their Report noted that after initially auto capturing the ILS LLZ and GS and tracking them for 2.5nm, the crew then disconnected the AP the aircraft was aligned to the left of the correct centerline with the contradictory ILS indications being attributed to false signals and advised as such to ATC, despite the fact that the ILS procedure was associated with an on-airport DME for range. Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) Terrain and Glideslope warnings were also noted to have been ignored during the latter part of the approach. The runway at Ballykelley, used only by military helicopters and light aircraft and not regularly inspected, was found to have met landing distance requirements. It was noted that the flight crew were unfamiliar with the intended destination airfield and had not been aware of the presence of another airfield near to their destination. The ATCO involved advised the Investigation that previous attempts to land both commercial and light aircraft at Ballykelly had been circumvented by ATC action. Noting that as a result of the incident, an additional alert to the existence of Ballykelly had been issued by Notice To Airmen and would be added to the State AIP, the Investigation made no Safety Recommendations.
