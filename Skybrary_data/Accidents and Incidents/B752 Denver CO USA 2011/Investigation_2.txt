or notification of bird hazards at Denver in particular or such requirements of this type which apply more generally. The Probable Cause was determined by the NTSB as: “The initial damage to the fan blades was caused by the ingestion of a Red-Tailed Hawk that caused one or more fan blades to fracture, striking the fan case and causing it to bulge. The initial fan blade fragment release impacted and damaged other passing fan blades generating various sized blades fragments. Some of these blade fragments were propelled forward of the fan case by passing fan blades and were re-ingested, creating a cascading effect of collateral impact damage to the other fan blades, the fan case, and the inlet cowl”. The Final Report ENG11IA051 was approved on 5 April 2012. No Safety Recommendations were made.
