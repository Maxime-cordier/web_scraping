that “given the growing trend in the number of reports of marginal take-offs and the studies currently available on this matter, the management of Lisbon Airport has designed some additional corrective measures, some have already been implemented and others are under consideration by the (Portuguese) National Civil Aviation Authority (ANAC), for possible implementation”. An already implemented interim action - the renaming of taxiways, intersections and takeoff positions to avoid possible misinterpretation of crews on current taxiways S1 or S2 compared to take-off hold point S4 - was noted to have been in place by NOTAM since December 2019 (see the illustration below) with an associated AIP updating process scheduled for 2 December 2021. The changes in taxiway designation planned for implementation from 5 December 2021. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The overall Conclusion of the Investigation was as follows: Current experience suggests that mistakes such as the ones described relating to this serious incident, where no consequences occurred, often go unreported. However, the GPIAAF recommends flight crew and operators to report such events, which will ensure that the lessons of the occurrence are shared with others, as with this case. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed on 29 June 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
