On 30 January 2013, the crew of a Boeing MD82 (SE-DIK) being operated by SAS on a scheduled passenger flight from Copenhagen to Dublin rejected a daylight take off in normal ground visibility when a loud "bang" was heard and the aircraft began veering to the left and the take off was rejected. Since there appeared to be no smoke or fire, the runway was vacated to await confirmation of that from the Airport Fire Service, which was received. Passengers were disembarked to buses. Although there was no damage to the aircraft other than to the failed left engine, an inspection of the runway found a large quantity of engine debris.
