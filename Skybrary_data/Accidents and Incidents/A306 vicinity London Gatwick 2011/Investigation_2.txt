through this position. The alpha-lock system referred to by the aircraft commander is a slat protection which according to the FCOM was found to state that “if the slats are selected to the 0/0 position while the angle of attack (AOA) is higher than 7.5°, the slat retraction is limited to 15°” and that “the slats will retract when the AOA is below 7.5°”. When asked for comment, Boeing stated that '“If the AOA is lower than 7.5° when the slats/flaps control lever is set to 0/0, the slats will retract and continue to retract even if the AOA becomes higher than 7.5°. The alpha-lock function is designed to prevent slats retraction at high AOA, not to stop retraction when it has started.” The Investigation concluded that because of the repetitive action to recycle the slats/flaps lever as a means to restore system function for departure, “the co-pilot had developed and exercised a motor skill to operate the slats/flap lever between 15/15 and 0/0 in one movement. The distraction of the slat problem and the preoccupation with the possibility of a slat malfunction on departure had mentally predisposed him to exercise the wrong motor skill and to retract the slats and flaps despite his intention to operate the landing gear lever.” The effectiveness of the blocking baulk at the intermediate 15/0 lever position was negated by the effect of recent practice in dealing with it. The Final Report of the Investigation AAIB Bulletin: 1/2012 EW/G2011/07/24 was published on 12 January 2012. No Safety Recommendations were made.
