a westerly track, at angle of approximately 25 degrees. The 738 pilots stated that they had first observed the other aircraft "at a horizontal distance of 8 nm in their 2 o'clock position at the same altitude". A TCAS TA without altitude indication was then presented on their NDs at a range estimated by the available evidence of 2nm. No avoiding action was taken and the 738 crossed tracks with the 172 "at a radar presented horizontal distance of 0.0 nm and seemingly at the same altitude" and with the relative radar tracks showing that the 738 "was overtaking the 172 almost directly from behind at with a speed of approximately 175 knots". The 738 pilots' subsequently stated that the other aircraft had "passed in front of them" at a range of 2nm and had been a Cessna 172. It was considered that the track closure shown on radar prior to crossing would have made the 172 "appear as an almost static object in the horizontal plane" as observed from the 738 flight deck. It was noted that "a static object is harder to detect for the human eye than a moving object" and that "a pilot, who loses visual contact with a 'static' aircraft usually finds it harder to re-establish visual contact with such an aircraft than with a 'moving' aircraft". It was concluded that "seemingly, a misperception by the pilots of the 738 of (their) horizontal separation (from the 172) influenced their decision on not making an appropriate avoiding action". Recorded radar data was found to have presented the minimum horizontal separation between the two aircraft as 0.0 nm which "indicated a separation of less than 0.05 nm, as a separation of between 0.05 nm and 0.149 nm would have been presented as 0.1 nm". It was considered by the Investigation that the accuracy with which an altitude of 4000 feet was being maintained by both aircraft was likely to have been greatest in the case of the 738 since the 172 had no autopilot and there was no reliable data to demonstrate otherwise. The 172 pilot subsequently advised that he had first seen the 738 shortly after the closest proximity and the radar recording of the aircraft track showed that at this point, its groundspeed had suddenly "increased from 110 knots to 150 knots and then decreased back to 110 knots" over a 33 second period and that "during the same time interval and according to the radar presentation, it had turned approximately 30 degrees to the right followed by a similar turn in the opposite direction back to the original course". Since the temporary increase in groundspeed was well above the speed attainable in level flight, it was concluded by the Investigation that it had occurred during a rapid descent from 4000 feet towards the base of the Copenhagen TMA at 2500 feet. Immediately after this 'apparent' descent, the 172 pilot advised Sweden Control that he would be changing frequency to Copenhagen Information where, having checked
