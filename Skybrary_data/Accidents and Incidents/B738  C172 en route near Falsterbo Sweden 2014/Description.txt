On 20 July 2014, a Boeing 737-800 (SU-GDY) on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Cairo to Copenhagen and maintaining 4000 feet in day VMC under Copenhagen radar control passed very close to a privately operated Cessna 172 (OY-AKH) which was en route from Bornholm to Roskilde at the same altitude and which had previously entered the Copenhagen TMA without clearance and with only a mode 'A' transponder identification transmitting.
