On 3 February 2019, an Airbus A320neo (SE-DOY) being operated by SAS on an international passenger flight from Copenhagen to Amsterdam as SK 553 failed to follow its post-landing taxi clearance and passed within a few metres of an Airbus 320 (G-EZWY) being operated by Easyjet U2 8885 on an international passenger flight from London Gatwick to Amsterdam. The crew of the Easyjet aircraft saw the impending collision risk and performed an emergency stop just in time to prevent impact. The conflict occurred at night in good ground visibility but the other aircraft crew did not notice the conflict and continued past the stopped aircraft at speed.
