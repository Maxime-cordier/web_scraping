and the lack of later, additional instructions.. The crew either did not hear or did not recall where to expect the other aircraft neither did they challenge air traffic control.. The ground controller did not challenge the crew when they gave an incomplete read back.. The darkness and background lighting in combination with the complexity of the location at Amsterdam Airport where the incident occurred and other tasks of the flight crew.. The darkness and the distance between the control tower and both aircraft.. The limitations of visual observation during darkness in combination with the properties of the ground radar system.. It was also concluded that: in circumstances such as those which prevailed on this case "it is preferable (for ATC) to repeat stop instructions and continue to stay in touch with crews, until they have a clear picture of the situation and the possibility of making mistakes is reduced".. the taxiway intersection where the conflict occurred was not designated as a hotspot, but several taxiways converge there.. despite the presence of designation signage, flight crews must be extra alert to distinguish the different intersections, especially in darkness due to the extensive background lighting and the illumination of multiple taxiways.. the possibilities for visual monitoring during darkness by a GND controller in combination with the restricted capabilities of the available ground radar, are not optimal. It is therefore important for GND controllers to verify that clearances have been properly heard and fully and correctly read back.. it is preferable for GND to repeat stop instructions and regularly to monitor the aircraft, until they have a clear picture of the situation thereby reducing the possibility of errors. For flight crews it is important to verify an instruction in the case it creates ambiguity.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 22 September 2021. Related Articles.
