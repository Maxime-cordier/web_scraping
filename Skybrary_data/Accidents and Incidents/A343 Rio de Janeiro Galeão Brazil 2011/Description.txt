On 8 December 2011, an Airbus A340-300 (CS-TOD) being operated by TAP Portugal on a scheduled international passenger flight (TP074) from Rio de Janeiro Gale√£o to Lisbon overran departure runway 10, which was reduced in length due to notified work-in-progress, during its night, normal visibility takeoff and then collided with runway 28 approach lights and ILS localiser antennae. Damage to the aircraft landing gear was not discovered until the flight had been completed and only when this was advised to the departure airport, did an inspection find the infrastructure damage caused.
