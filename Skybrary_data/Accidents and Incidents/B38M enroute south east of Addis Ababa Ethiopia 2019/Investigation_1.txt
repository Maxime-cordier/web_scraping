An Investigation conducted in accordance with ICAO Annex 13 principles was carried out by an Investigation Committee made up of investigators from the Ethiopian CAA Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (EAIB). Both the CVR and the DFDR were recovered from the accident site and their data were subsequently successfully downloaded. A Preliminary Report and an Interim Report were published during the Investigation (on 4 April 2019 and on 9 March 2020 respectively). Both contained interim safety recommendations which are reproduced below with the new Safety Recommendations made in this report on completion of the Investigation. The 29 year-old Captain, who had been PF for the accident flight, had accumulated 8,122 hours total flying experience. After completing pilot basic training in 2010, he had received a type rating for the Boeing 737 the following year and had subsequently been employed by the airline as a First Officer on the that type and the Boeing 767 and Boeing 777/787 until gaining his command on the Boeing 737-800 in October 2017. After CBT (Computer-based Training) Differences Training for the 737 MAX 8 in July 2018, he successfully completed a proficiency check on the variant in October 2018. At the time of the accident he had a total of 4,017 hours experience on the Boeing 737-800 NG including 1,417 hours in command and a total of 103 hours on the Boeing 737 MAX-8. His training records indicated a generally above average proficiency. The 25 year-old First Officer had 361 hours total flying experience and had qualified for his Boeing 737-800 and MAX-8 type rating three months prior to the accident. This was followed by line training which led to a successful Line Check on 31 January 2019. At the time of the accident, he had a total of 207 hours flying experience on the 737-800 and the 787 MAX 8. It was immediately clear that difficulty in controlling the pitch of the aircraft had been a critical factor during the flight and noted that on Boeing 737 aircraft, this is achieved by means of hydraulically powered elevators and an electrically powered stabiliser with the elevators controlled by movement of the control columns and the stabiliser controlled by automatic or manual trim commands. The stabiliser may also be manually controlled through movement of the switches on the control column yokes or by rotating the pitch trim wheels manually. In summary, the crew were faced with a failure of the left AOA sensing system immediately after takeoff which compromised the Captainâ€™s PFD indications and his display of airspeed and altitude. Attempts to control the aircraft by keeping the AP engaged were unsuccessful and four successive MCAS nose-down trim activations incorrectly triggered by the invalid left AOA input occurred. The thrust remained at the takeoff setting and it became increasing difficult, and eventually impossible, for the crew to successfully oppose the MCAS nose down action using either the elevator via their control columns or their electric stabiliser trim inputs.
