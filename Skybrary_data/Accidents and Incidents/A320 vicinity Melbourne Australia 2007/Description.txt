On 21 July 2007, an Airbus A320-200 being operated by Australian operator Jetstar on a scheduled passenger flight from Christchurch, New Zealand to Melbourne, Australia made a go around after an unsuccessful ILS approach to the destination runway in day Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) because of insufficient visual reference at the applicable ILS Decision Height. The go-around procedure was not flown correctly and descent to within 38 ft of the ground occurred in fog before the required climb away was begun. A further unsuccessful approach with a correctly flown go around had then followed before a diversion to Avalon.
