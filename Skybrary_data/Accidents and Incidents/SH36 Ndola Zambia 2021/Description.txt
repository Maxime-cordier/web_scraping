On 24 October 2021, a Shorts SD360 (9S-GAP) was being operated by Malu Aviation on a non revenue international positioning flight from Goma DR Congo to Lanseria South Africa with three company engineers as passengers. It was intended that the first of two en-route stops would be made at Ndola but the crew were unaware that the civil airport had recently moved to a newly built airport 8 miles away which had kept the same name (Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport) and radio frequencies of the old international airport which had been re-designated for military use. Whilst working ATC at the new airport, the flight routed in hazy day VMC to the old airport as flight planned and landed there without clearance.
