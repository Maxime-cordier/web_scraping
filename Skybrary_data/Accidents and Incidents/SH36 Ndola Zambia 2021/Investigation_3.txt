data for the old Ndola airport (FLND) for arrival, approach and departure were still available as published to international airways publishers.. Arrival and Departure procedures for the new airport (FLSK) were incomplete.. The new airport (FLSK) had an ILS installed but there was no published procedure for its use.. The changeover risk analysis conducted by teams from the CAA and the ZACL excluded CAA Operations Inspectors.. Tape transcripts consulted by Investigation found that controllers at FLSK were using non-standard phraseology.. No SIDs or STARs had been published for FLND since it was re-designated as a military air base.. Some controllers at FLND since it became a military air base were operating without civil aviation licences which means civil aircraft cannot be handled by them.. Some controllers at FLND did not know how to use an Aldis Lamp for visual communication with non-radio aircraft despite the TWR VCR having that capability.. In the absence of visual landing procedures at FLSK, the airport operator (ZACL) insisted that VFR pilots are solely responsible for correctly identifying the airport.. A total of 14 Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Findings of the Investigation as follows: that the Zambia Airports Corporation Ltd (ZACL) conducts a course of refresher training for its staff. [AAIB/SR/2022/014]. that the ZACL consider training some Tower ATCOs as MET observers for them to be able to advise on met information. [AAIB/SR/2022/015]. that the ZACL urgently publish Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs), Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs) and Visual approach and landing charts for the new Ndola International Airport (FLSK). [AAIB/SR/2022/016]. that the ZACL urgently publish an Instrument Landing System (ILS) Chart for the new Ndola International Airport (FLSK). [AAIB/SR/2022/017]. that the ZACL ensure availability of Audio Transcripts to assist investigations of incidents and accidents. [AAIB/SR/2022/018]. that the ZACL ensure that communications concerning Aeronautical Information Services between Zambia and DR Congo are improved. [AAIB/SR/2022/019]. that the ZACL ensure that there are specific procedures for verbally warning foreign VFR pilots of the proximity of the Ndola military airport to the new Ndola International Airport and provide action to ensure pilots do not misidentify them. [AAIB/SR/2022/020]. that the ZACL revisit the Risk Analysis for the two Ndola airports i.e. the new International Airport (FLSK) and the former one (FLND) which is now a Zambian Air Force base. [AAIB/SR/2022/021]. that the Zambia Air Force (ZAF) ensure accuracy of all flight plans filed for clearance. [AAIB/SR/2022/022]. that the ZAF publish a new Location Indicator and coordinates for their military base with the ZACL when cancelling the expired location indicator for the former Ndola Airport including its associated navigation procedures with International aeronautical charts publishers. [AAIB/SR/2022/023]. that the ZAF publish an Airspace Restriction from Ground to 2000 feet agl for the former Ndola civil airport now designated as a Military base. [AAIB/SR/2022/024]. that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) ensure that the ZACL publishes Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs), Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs), Visual approach and landing charts and Instrument Landing System (ILS) Charts for Ndola
