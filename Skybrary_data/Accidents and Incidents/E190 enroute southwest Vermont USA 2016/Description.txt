On 25 My 2016, multiple indications of electrical system failure appeared on an Embraer ERJ190 (C-FHOS) being operated by Air Canada on a scheduled international passenger flight from Boston to Toronto as ACA361 whilst it was in the cruise at FL 360 in day VMC having completed about a quarter of the planned flight. The autopilot disconnected and three of the five EFIS displays went dark. Automatic deployment of the RAT restored some of the lost power and during a descent initiated to FL 240 it was possible to start the APU which restored most of the rest. Sufficient systems were restored to allow the flight to be completed as originally intended and this was achieved without any significant remaining airworthiness issues being apparent to the crew. On arrival, it was immediately apparent on inspection by Company maintenance personnel that smoke and fire in an avionics bay had accompanied the electrical fault.
