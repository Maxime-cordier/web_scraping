of another Jetconnect B737-800 (ZK-ZQC) in Wellington on 11 September 2013. In this case, following a crew defect report of being unable to lock the right main landing gear in the up position, a rag had been found wrapped around the right main landing gear uplock assembly. The aircraft landing gear had been under maintenance at Qantas' Melbourne maintenance facility. The report of the local investigation by Qantas and Jetconnect found that "the rag had been used by an engineer to protect against an accidental head strike on the uplock during a maintenance task in the right main wheel well area". It was noted that despite all the usual inspection procedures being in place at both Qantas maintenance facilities "in both cases a rag left inside the aircraft caused a safety issue with a system that was critical for flight". The formally-stated Findings of the Investigation were that: The integrity of the aeroplane’s stabiliser trim system manual control was compromised by a rag that became trapped under a control cable that was wound onto the forward cable drum of the stabiliser trim system.. It was highly likely that the rag ended up in the aeroplane’s electronics and equipment compartment following cleaning, inspection, or maintenance conducted at the Qantas Sydney maintenance facility.. No relevant Safety Actions by the involved parties were reported to the Investigation. The Final Report of the Investigation was approved for publication in February 2015 and subsequently published on 26 March 2015. No Safety Recommendations were made.
