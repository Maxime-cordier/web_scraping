On 7 February 2011, a Bombardier DHC8-100 being operated by Air Inuit on a scheduled domestic passenger flight in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) from La Grande-Rivière north to Puvirnituq failed to maintain its cleared flight level and descended without pilot awareness towards a DHC8-300 also being operated by Air Inuit on a positioning flight in exactly the opposite direction, from Puvirnituq south to La Grande-Rivière at a cleared level 1000 feet below. Co-ordinated Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) RAs alerted the flight crews to the potential conflict but both pilots acting as PF initially reacted by making turns rather than by following their RAs. Once the RAs were followed, adequate separation was achieved. None of the respective 31 and 3 occupants were injured.
