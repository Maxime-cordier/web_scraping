On 18 January 2007 an ATR 42-300 freighter developed a control difficulty just after a night take off from Stansted UK, which led the flight crew to declare an emergency and undertake an immediate return to land. The landing was uneventful but the approach flown was unstable, with Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) warnings, and the origin of the handling difficulty was considered to be, in part, due to inappropriate control inputs by one of the pilots.
