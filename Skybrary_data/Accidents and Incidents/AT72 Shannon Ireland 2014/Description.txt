On 26 February 2014, an ATR 72-202 (EI-FXG) on a scheduled cargo flight from Shannon to Cork at night in normal ground visibility was being marshalled off its parking position when the left wing was in collision with the structure of an adjacent hangar. Damage was caused to the leading edge of the wing and to the steel cladding of the hangar.
