On 5 March 2018, an Airbus 320 (A6-EIF) being operated by Etihad Airways on an international passenger flight from Abu Dhabi to Karachi as EY200 was in the cruise at FL 370 in day VMC when the crew noticed a slow rise in cabin altitude.

The flight continued on track to the intended destination and the remainder of the flight was without further event.
