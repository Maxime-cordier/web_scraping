On 5 May 2017, a Boeing 737-400 (JY-JAP) being operated by Jordan Aviation on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Bamako to Timbuktu as JAV 7843 departed the end of the destination runway after a fast and slightly late touchdown off a visual daylight approach and insufficient deceleration thereafter to exit as intended at the end of the runway. None of the occupants were injured but the aircraftâ€™s left engine sustained internal damage to all its fan blades due to ingestion of multiple pieces of small gravel from the soft ground area where it ended up.
