On 14 September 2021 a Cranfield University-operated and recently acquired Saab S340B (G-NFLB) configured as a flying classroom was being used to facilitate type training of two of the new operatorâ€™s senior pilots by Loganair Training Captains current on type. After engine-out handling familiarisation, the left engine could not be restarted because the right engine starter-generator had failed. The resulting priority to achieve a landing before battery-source electrical power was exhausted was met by a successful diversion to Campbeltown led by the Training Captain in command at the time.
