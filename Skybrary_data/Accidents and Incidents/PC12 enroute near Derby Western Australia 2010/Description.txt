On 29 January 2010, a Pilatus PC-12/45 being operated on an aerial work basis on a Medevac flight from Derby to Kununurra Western Australia and climbing through FL180 in night Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) experienced signs of engine malfunction and initiated an air turnback during which the engine failed completely. The subsequent 6nm glide descent and approach culminated in a successful landing with the aircraft undamaged and all four occupants unhurt.
