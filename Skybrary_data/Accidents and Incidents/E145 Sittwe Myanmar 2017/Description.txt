On 18 September 2017, an Embraer 145EP (XY-ALE) being operated by Air Mandalay Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Yangon to Sittwe followed an unstable approach with a very hard (over 4g) landing. The flight crew did not detect any of the resulting serious wing damage and the aircraft continued in service for three further flights before the damage, which had rendered the aircraft unfit to fly, was discovered.
