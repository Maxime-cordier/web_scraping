On 5 April 1996 a significant loss of separation occurred in daylight when a BOEING 747-400 (international, winglets) being operated by British Airways and having just taken off from runway 27R at London Heathrow came into conflict to the west of the Airport with an AIRBUS A-300-600 being operated by Emirates which had just, upon ATC instruction, commenced a missed approach from the parallel runway 27L.
