An Investigation was carried out by the UK AAIB which established by reference to the ATC Separation Monitoring Function(SMF) equipment which monitors aircraft separation but is not contemporaneously displayed to controllers, that "at their closest proximity the two aircraft were between 600 and 700 feet apart vertically and between 0·71 and 0·82 nm horizontally. The event happened shortly after a third aircraft had burst a tyre during a landing on runway 27L some 3 minutes earlier. The response to this circumstance led to an expected temporary increase in controller workload in circumstances where the two runways were under the control of separate TWR ATCOs and with one runway designated for landings and one for take offs. It was found that prior to the loss of separation, both aircraft had been correctly following their ATC clearances and that both had then received and correctly followed TCAS RAs, the B744 to descend and the A306 to adjust vertical speed. Simultaneously to the TCAS RA activation, corrective ATC clearances had been issued. The Investigation concluded that "by adhering to the TCAS instructions, the crews of both aircraft prevented a possible collision" and noted that the specific procedures established for ATC response in the event of a missed approach occurring which required the Departures and Arrivals Controllers to co-ordinate with each other to maintain separation were "not complied with in this incident". No Safety Recommendations were made. The full AAIB Final Report of the Investigation was published on 4 July 1996.
