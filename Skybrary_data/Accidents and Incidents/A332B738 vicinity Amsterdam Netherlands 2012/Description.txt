On 13 November an Airbus A330-200 being operated by Garuda on a scheduled passenger flight from Dubai to Amsterdam and a Boeing 737-800 being operated by KLM on a scheduled passenger flight from Manchester to Amsterdam were being radar vectored to Instrument Landing System (ILS) approaches to runways 18C and 18R respectively in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when the prescribed traffic separation was lost. ATC gave corrective headings and the two aircraft then continued their ILS approaches as planned. There were no abrupt manoeuvres and no TCAS RAs during deconfliction.
