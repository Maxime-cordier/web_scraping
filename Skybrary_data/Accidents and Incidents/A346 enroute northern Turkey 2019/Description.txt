On 21 August 2019, an Airbus A340-600 (G-VFIT) being operated by Virgin Atlantic Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from New Delhi to London Heathrow with an augmented crew was in the cruise in day IMC when it unexpectedly encountered transient moderate to severe turbulence whilst the seat belt signs were off. As a result one passenger sustained a serious injury and one member of the cabin crew a minor injury. The flight thereafter was completed without further event with a medical emergency declared for arrival and a priority approach granted.
