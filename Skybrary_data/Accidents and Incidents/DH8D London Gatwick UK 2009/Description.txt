On 1 November 2009, a Bombardier DHC8-400 being operated by UK regional airline Flybe on a scheduled passenger flight from Newcastle to London Gatwick made a hard landing at an abnormally high pitch angle at destination in normal day visibility and significant structural damage to the aft lower airframe resulted. No occupants were injured and the aircraft was taxied in to parking without further event.
