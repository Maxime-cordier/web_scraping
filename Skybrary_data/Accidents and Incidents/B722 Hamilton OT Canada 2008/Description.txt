On 22 July 2008, a Kelowna Flightcraft Air Charter Ltd. Boeing 727-200 was operating a cargo flight from Moncton NB, to Hamilton, OT. After radar vectoring for an approach to Runway 06 at Hamilton, the aircraft touched down hard and bounced before touching down hard a second time. Immediately after the second touchdown, a go-around was initiated. During rotation, the tailskid made contact with the runway. The thrust reverser actuator fairing and the number 2 engine tailpipe made contact with the ground off the departure end of the runway. The aircraft climbed away and then returned for a normal landing on Runway 12. There were no injuries; the aircraft sustained only minor damage.
