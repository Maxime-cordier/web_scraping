An Investigation was carried out by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board. Their findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors were as follows: (1) The go-around was initiated with the spoilers deployed. This resulted in added drag that precluded a safe lift-off and caused the tail and the number 2 engine to strike the ground. (2) The crew had not received any training for a bounced landing or a go-around after touchdown and therefore did not retract the spoilers. Their findings as to Risk were as follows: (1) The bounced landing recovery and go-around procedures do not direct crews to stow the spoilers. In the event of a go-around after touchdown, crews may leave the speedbrake lever in the extended position, increasing the risk of the aircraft not being able to meet the required climb gradient. (2) Cockpit voice recorder (CVR) information regarding this incident was overwritten. The lack of CVR data hampered investigators’ ability to obtain a timely and complete understanding of the event. One other Finding of the Investigation was given. This was that “while vertical acceleration was recorded at 1.9 g and 2.3 g, it is likely that the actual g values experienced by the aircraft were higher.” One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation: “The Department of Transport require air carriers to incorporate bounced landing recovery techniques in their flight manuals and to teach these techniques during initial and recurrent training.”
