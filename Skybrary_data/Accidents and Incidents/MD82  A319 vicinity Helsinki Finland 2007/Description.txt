On 5 September 2007 in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), an MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MD-82 being operated by SAS on a scheduled passenger flight from Copenhagen to Helsinki was obliged to carry out an own-initiative avoiding action orbit in day VMC against an Airbus A319 being operated by Finnair on a scheduled passenger flight from St. Petersburg to Helsinki after conflict when about to join final approach. Both aircraft were following ATC instructions which, in the case of the MD 82, had not included maintaining own separation so that the applicable separation minima were significantly breached.
