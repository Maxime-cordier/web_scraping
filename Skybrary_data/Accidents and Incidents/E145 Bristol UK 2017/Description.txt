On 22 December 2017, an Embraer 145 (G-CKAG) being operated by bmi Regional on a scheduled passenger flight from Frankfurt to Bristol left the side of the runway soon after touching down in fog off a daylight Cat II approach to runway 27 at destination. Damage to the aircraft was not significant and none of the occupants were injured so an emergency evacuation was not ordered. ATC, who in the absence of surface movement radar did not know where the aircraft was, were advised of the excursion by the crew who had shut down the engines and started the APU. RFFS vehicles reached the aircraft within 3 minutes and established direct communications with the crew on the designated frequency of 121.6 MHz.
