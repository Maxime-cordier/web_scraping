2016 were noted in which the flaps were retracted after takeoff instead of the landing gear being selected up. Again it was noted that despite the location, shape and feel of the respective controls being different, mis-selection had still occurred. The formally-documented Conclusion of the Investigation was as follows: The accident arose as a result of the inadvertent selection of the Emergency/Parking brake instead of the speed brake. The levers are of similar shape and sited close to each other but with a different appearance and mode of action. There is also a brake on indicator light. These risk controls proved ineffective in preventing the inadvertent selection of the Emergency/parking brake both on this occasion and on at least two previous occasions. Once the parking brake had been set there were opportunities to detect and correct the error, but a busy flight deck environment together with a high workload contributed to it going unnoticed. After touchdown, the aircraft may have remained on the runway surface but for the addition of forward thrust during the landing roll. The manufacturer stated that it did not intend to conduct a system review relating to the parking brake status. Safety Action taken following the accident by the aircraft operator was noted as having included an addition to the Landing Checklist to require the PF to confirm that the parking brake is off. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 10 January 2019. No Safety Recommendations were made.
