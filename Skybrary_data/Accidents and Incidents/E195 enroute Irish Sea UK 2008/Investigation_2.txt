causing them to slide straight onto the ground at speed. This, and attempts by people to slow themselves on the slides, were the main causes of minor injury to five occupants of out the 95 persons on board during the evacuation. It was noted that the issue of ambiguous over-wing exit escape route markings had been the subject of an AAIB Safety Recommendation in 2002 in respect of certification of such exits on all types, but that this had been ignored by the JAA. Two Safety Recommendations , the first of which was a re-issue of a 2002 one to the former JAA which had been ignored, were made as follows: that the European Aviation Safety Agency review the design, contrast and conspicuity of wing surface markings associated with emergency exits on Public Transport aircraft, with the aim of ensuring that the route to be taken from wing to ground is marked unambiguously.. [2010-007] that Embraer modify the over-wing emergency exits on Embraer 195 aircraft, to eliminate the possibility of the exit door jamming due to interference between the door trim panel and the ceiling edge panel.. [2010-008] The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 10 June 2010.
