On 1 August 2008, an Embraer 195 being operated by Flybe on a scheduled passenger service from Manchester to Belfast City with the No 2 air conditioning pack inoperative in accordance with the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) was passing FL 156 in the climb in day Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) approximately 40 nm northwest of Liverpool when the No 1 Air Cycle Machine (ACM) failed, releasing smoke and fumes into the aircraft. A MAYDAY was declared to ATC and a diversion to the Isle of Man was carried out. After donning oxygen masks the pilots had great difficulty communicating with each other, ATC and cabin crew, because of technical problems with the masks. During the subsequent emergency evacuation ordered by the aircraft commander, the right over-wing emergency exit door became jammed and unusable and five of the 94 occupants sustained minor injuries when using the main exit slides.
