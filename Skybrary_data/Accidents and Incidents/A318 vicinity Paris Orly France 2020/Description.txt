On 12 September 2020, an Airbus A318 (F-GUGM) being operated by Air France on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Biarritz to Paris Orly was seriously mismanaged during a largely autopilot-controlled ILS approach to destination in day VMC. Despite being comprehensively unstabilised throughout and passing the applicable ‘gate’ at 26 knots above the calculated approach speed with idle thrust set, the approach was continued without hesitation to a landing.
