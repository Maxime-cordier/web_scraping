An Investigation was carried out by the French Civil Aviation Accident Investigation Agency, the BEA using relevant FDR and recorded ATC data. Relevant CVR data was overwritten despite the fact that the flight was arriving at one of the airline’s main operating bases. The Captain had initially joined Air France as a First Officer in 1997 and had been promoted to command on the Airbus A320 in 2008. He had a total of 10,200 hours flying experience of which 4,200 hours was on type. First Officer had joined Air France as a First Officer in 2019 and had a total of 5,500 hours flying experience of which 3,200 hours were on type. Inbound to Paris Orly in light traffic conditions in CAVOK VMC with the Captain as PF and an ILS approach to runway 25 expected, the crew had not identified their much reduced recency as a potential consideration in their approach briefing. When, at around FL112, the controller asked the crew if they were interested in a shortened route, they replied in the affirmative. AP1 was engaged. They were then given a radar heading direct towards the Coulommiers VOR and descent to 3,000 feet QNH (see this VOR relative to the approach track subsequently flown on the annotated ground track show in the illustration below). Passing FL 110 (point 1 in the illustration), OPEN DES/NAV mode was engaged with a selected speed of 250 knots. The speed brakes were then selected. Passing 8,700 feet (point 2 in the illustration), the controller advised that they could “plan for a short circuit if they were interested and if so to call back when ready for the base leg in around one minute’s time". After approximately 30 seconds (at point 3 in the illustration), the flight called ready for base and was given an initial radar heading onto north. As soon as they were established on this heading (point 4 in the illustration), the LOC mode engaged and the flight requested a left turn. It was instructed to turn onto heading 290° and cleared for the ILS 25 approach. The annotated ground track - from position 6 to touchdown (position 11) took exactly 2 minutes. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The speed was unchanged and the aircraft had just left 6000 feet. The A/THR was already in SPEED mode and APP mode and AP2 were then engaged. Passing 4,900 feet, the rate of descent was 2,200fpm with the speed brakes stowed and as the ILS LOC neared, LOC* was annunciated. Passing 3,500 feet (point 5 in the illustration) with the speed still 250 knots but now established on the ILS LOC and passing 3,500 feet with 9.1 nm to go, the aircraft was around 600 feet above the ILS GS. It was transferred to TWR with “free speed”. The speedbrakes were 50% deployed but although the crew needed to continue descent to capture the ILS GS from above, the fact that the selected altitude was 3000 feet resulted in ALT* mode engaging.
