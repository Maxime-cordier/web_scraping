This caused the engine N1s to increase from 27% to 40% in order to level off and which reduced the rate of descent to 1,500 fpm. In response, both APs were disengaged and a 3000 fpm rate of descent was selected and the selected altitude was changed to 3,600 feet. This was quickly followed by a change in the selected altitude to 2,000 feet which was the missed approach stop altitude. At this time, the thrust was varying between 30% and 40% N1 and the rate of descent stabilised at around 1,600 fpm. At 2,700 feet - 7.4nm from the runway threshold - the ILS LOC was captured with the aircraft still in clean configuration and at 250 knots. ‘Managed Speed’ was selected and the target speed then decreased to the “green dot” speed which resulted in engine thrust decreasing to 23% and the rate of descent increasing to 2,200 fpm. Both APs were then re-engaged and the speedbrakes were first retracted and then armed. Passing 2,000 feet aal (2,287 feet altitude) with 6nm to go and the A/THR in speed mode, the aircraft became fully established on the ILS still in clean configuration at a recorded 253 knots and with a 1,500 fpm rate of descent. Both AP were disengaged and a nose-up input was made on the Captain’s sidestick which resulted in the airspeed decreasing to 237 knots and the flight path deviating above the previously acquired glideslope. The landing gear was extended (point 6 in the illustration) and after a further half mile, flaps 1 was selected (point 7 in the illustration). The PF, who reported then looking up and having the runway in sight, reacted by making a nose-down pitch input which increased the rate of descent to 2,750 fpm and led to the aircraft deviating almost full scale below the glideslope. At 1,000 feet aal with 3.7 nm to go, the indicated airspeed was 204 knots (VAPP +78 knots), the engine thrust was “close to idle” at 28% and the rate of descent was 1,328 fpm. The landing configuration was then changed from ‘flaps full’ to ‘flaps 3’ in the FMS (which increased the VAPP by 3 knots to 126 KIAS ) and at the same time, a Mode 5 EGPWS ‘Glideslope’ Alert was annunciated on the aircraft simultaneously with an MSAW Warning being activated in TWR. The controller immediately advised the crew of the MSAW Terrain alert and instructed the crew to immediately check their altitude (point 8 in the illustration) and received the response that they were maintaining altitude. The Captain then made a nose-up input on the sidestick which changed the pitch attitude changed from -2.7° to +7° which returned the aircraft to the glideslope. At 940 feet aal with 3.2 nm to go, flaps 2 was being selected as the controller asked for confirmation that they were on the glideslope (point 9 in the illustration) and they were assured accordingly. Nine seconds later, at 900 feet aal (point 10 on the
