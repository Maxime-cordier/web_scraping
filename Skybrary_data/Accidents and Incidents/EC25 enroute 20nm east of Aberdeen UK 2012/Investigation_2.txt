being taken by Eurocopter to resolve the matter in respect of the EC225 was noted but since the same type of Automatically Deployable Emergency Locator Transmitter (ADELT) device is also fitted to several other aircraft types not addressed by actions taken in respect of the EC225, two more Safety Recommendations were therefore issued: that the European Aviation Safety Agency requires the manufacturers of aircraft equipped with a Type 15-503 Crash Position Indicator system, or similar Automatically Deployable Emergency Locator Transmitter, to review and amend, if necessary, the respective Flight Manuals to ensure they contain information about any features that could inhibit automatic deployment. [2013-006]. that the Federal Aviation Administration requires the manufacturers of aircraft equipped with a Type 15-503 Crash Position Indicator system, or similar Automatically Deployable Emergency Locator Transmitter, to review and amend, if necessary, the respective Flight Manuals to ensure they contain information about any features that could inhibit automatic deployment. [2013-007]. This Bulletin also confirmed the finding that both MGB oil losses had occurred because of the fracture of the bevel gear vertical shaft and that the most likely cause of both emergency lubrication system false failure annunciations had been a consequence of an error by Eurocopter in the specification issued to the manufacturer of a related pressure switch. Since it was the false indication that the emergency MGB lubrication system had failed that was the reason both helicopters had been ditched, it was noted that Eurocopter had issued an Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) on 22 February 2013 requiring the modification of pressures switch wiring to fix the problem and that this ASB had then been mandated by an EASA AD 2013-0037 the same day. The Investigation is continuing and an independent review of the fracture mechanics to establish why both these shafts failed during normal operations is being carried out. It is not yet certain that the root causes of the failure of the both shafts occurred for the same reasons. The Investigation so far is covered by Special Bulletins as follows: S2/2012. S3/2012, published on 13 July 2012. S5/2012, published on 17 October 2012. S7/2012, published on 29 November 2012. S2/2013, published on 18 March 2013 and containing Safety Recommendations 2013-006 and 2013-007.
