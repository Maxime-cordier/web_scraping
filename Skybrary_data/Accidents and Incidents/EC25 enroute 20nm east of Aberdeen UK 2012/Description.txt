On 10 May 2012, a Eurocopter EC225 making a 150nm passenger flight from Aberdeen to the Maersk Resilient Offshore Platform in the North Sea in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) was in the cruise at an altitude of 3000 feet with the AP engaged when there was a sudden warning of failure of the main gearbox (MGB) lubrication system and soon afterwards, another warning indicating failure of the emergency lubrication system. A controlled ditching was completed in benign conditions and, with the Emergency Flotation System functioning normally the 14 occupants evacuated into one of the life rafts. Two occupants sustained minor injuries whilst evacuating; six were subsequently rescued by a SAR helicopter and the remainder were transferred to a lifeboat.
