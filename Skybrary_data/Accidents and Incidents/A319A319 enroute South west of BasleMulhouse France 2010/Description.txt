On 29 June 2010, an Airbus A319 (HB-JZQ) being operated by Easyjet Switzerland on a scheduled passenger flight from Palma to Basel Mulhouse as DS1058 and another Airbus A319 (F-GRHA) being operated by Air France on a scheduled passenger flight from Basel-Mulhouse to Paris CDG as AF7343 lost separation whilst following clearances given by a trainee controller which brought them into conflict. One of the cabin crew of the Easyjet aircraft, which was crewed by a Captain under training and a Training Captain, sustained minor injuries during the abrupt manoeuvring which followed the annunciated RAs.
