concern that the occupants had not been allowed to disembark from the aircraft more promptly after arrival back in Dublin, given the potentially adverse consequences had the aircraft or cabin air been significantly contaminated. It was concluded that the probable cause of the adverse symptoms reported by the aircraft crew and some passengers could not be determined. Three Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) should review the licensing requirement of major airports in Ireland, as specified in the Manual of Aerodrome Licensing, to comply with ICAO guidelines for large airports and to ensure that the provision of adequate medical services are part of the licensing provisions. (IRLD2010012). Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) should review the provision of medical services at Dublin Airport. (IRLD2010013). Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) should review the response procedures to ensure that passengers and crew are not unduly detained in a potentially toxic environment, following cabin air quality events. (IRLD2010014). The Final Report of the investigation was published on 15 July 2010 and may be seen in full at SKYbrary bookshelf:AAIU Report No: 2010-008
