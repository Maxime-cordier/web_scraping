On 29 April 2013, a Boeing 747-400 BCF (N949CA) being operated by National Airlines as NCR102 under callsign ISAF 95NQ on a cargo flight from Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan to Dubai World Central was observed to suddenly pitch up to an abnormal attitude almost immediately after a daylight take off from Bagram in VMC. It then began to descend and recovery was not achieved. All 7 crew members were killed and the aircraft destroyed in the subsequent impact with terrain and the post crash fire which followed.
