On 18 June 2013, a Boeing 737-800 (VH-YIR) being operated by Virgin Australia Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Brisbane to Adelaide as Velocity 1384 with 91 passengers on board was unable to land at its destination due to a deterioration in the weather there and upon diversion to its designated alternate, Mildura, was unable to land even when continuing 260 feet below MDA for the same reason. With ATC having declared a distress phase and with passengers instructed to adopt the brace position, a further non precision approach was then made, again with a significant breach of the prevailing approach minima and a successful landing was finally achieved in day IMC three minutes after a weather observation giving 200 metres visibility in fog with a 100 feet cloudbase with fuel significantly below the required reserves.
