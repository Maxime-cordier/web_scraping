On 25 July 2008, a Boeing 747-400 being operated by Qantas on a scheduled passenger flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) was cruising at FL290 when it rapidly depressurised following the sudden explosive rupture of one of the emergency oxygen cylinders located in the forward cargo hold which entered the passenger cabin before falling from the aircraft. A MAYDAY was declared and an emergency descent made to 10,000 ft, after which the flight then diverted to Manila, Philippines. None of the 369 occupants was injured.
