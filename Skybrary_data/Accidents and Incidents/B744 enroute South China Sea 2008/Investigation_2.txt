research conducted as part of the investigation was considered to have demonstrated that the cylinder type involved was of “an inherently robust and damage-tolerant design”. In the absence of the cylinder, however, no Probable Cause could be established for its failure. The flight crew were judged by the Investigation to have provided a “well-managed and appropriate emergency response” that minimised the risks associated with the depressurisation and the remainder of the flight. It was noted that following the depressurisation, various aircraft equipment had been inoperative, including one of the VORs, all three Instrument Landing System (ILS) systems and the left hand FMC. The overall performance of the cabin crew was found to have been “effective and to have contributed directly to the continued safety of the passengers”. However, it was also found that Cabin crew training facilities did not appropriately replicate the oxygen equipment installed on the aircraft, including the drop-down oxygen mask assemblies. Several cabin crew were found to have become “partially and temporarily incapacitated” during the emergency response to the event. No Safety Recommendations were made but various recorded Safety Actions were focussed on “ensuring that oxygen cylinder handling and maintenance procedures are optimal; that flight and cabin crew are suitably prepared for efficient management of a depressurisation situation; and that passengers are clearly and succinctly informed of their responsibilities and likely experiences during a situation that requires the use of the cabin oxygen masks”.
