On 10 February 2010 a Boeing 737-300 being operated by KLM on a scheduled passenger flight from Amsterdam to Warsaw, Poland took off in normal night visibility from a taxiway parallel to the runway for which take off clearance had been given and accepted - runway 36C. Because of the available distance and the absence of obstructions, the take off was completed uneventfully as was the subsequent flight.
