[…] Neither crew was aware of the other’s ac until a very late stage when they had switched to LOS APP. Both crews were in IMC in cloud and neither ac was fitted with TCAS. Furthermore, it was unfortunate that the avoiding action proffered by LOS APP when confronted with these two ac in close proximity was too late to be effective as the crew of the Nimrod called just before the returns merged. It was purely fortuitous that any separation existed at all as each ac turned in opposite directions and both ac climbed. The Board concluded unanimously that a definite risk of collision existed in circumstances conscientiously reported here.
