On 17 October 2006, at night, in low cloud and poor visibility conditions in the vicinity of Kinloss Airfield UK, a loss of separation event occurred between an RAF Nimrod MR2 aircraft and a civilian AS332L Puma helicopter. The Nimrod was flying an aerodrome training circuit and was vectored by Approach for an “azimuth-only” approach [no glidepath information - advisory heights are passed with range from touchdown]. When the Nimrod was on short final (2-3nm), the crew executed a go-around as part of the training and the aircraft came in close proximity to a previously departed AS332L helicopter.
