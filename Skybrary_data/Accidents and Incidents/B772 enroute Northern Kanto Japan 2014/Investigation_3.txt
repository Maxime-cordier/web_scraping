issued. In the absence of this updated information, the Captain had no reason to commence climb from FL270 at the first indication of turbulence and after continuing at the same level until the first severe turbulence episode had begun, he then completed the whole climb to FL350 within airspace which was the subject of the first of the two JMA SIGMETs referred to above. The way in which Dispatchers presented en-route forecast information to American Airlines flight crews prior to flight and flight crews’ ability to access additional information was found to differ between departures from Company 'hub' airports and all others in a way that made crew awareness less effective. The absence of any update to the in-flight aircraft by data communication was also noted. This situation was considered to have contributed considerably to the risk of exposure to the severe turbulence encountered. Safety Action was taken by American Airlines as a result of the investigated event to "strengthen the Internet environment in order to enable the flight crew members to acquire necessary weather information with portable terminals in all airports which the Company flies into in the same manner as (at) hub airports”. The Investigation determined that the Probable Cause of the Accident was that "the aircraft was fiercely shaken because it unexpectedly penetrated airspace with CAT, causing serious injury to a passenger and one of the cabin crew". It was also concluded that "the unexpected penetration into airspace with CAT (occurred) because the Captain and the Dispatcher did not predict the occurrence of the CAT which could interfere with the flight, on account of the method for acquisition of weather information used by American Airlines". The Final Report was completed on 31 March 2016. No Safety Recommendations were made.
