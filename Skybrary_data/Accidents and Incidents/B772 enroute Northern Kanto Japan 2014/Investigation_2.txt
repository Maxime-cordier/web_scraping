all abnormal turbulence ceased. The relationship between the positions marked by notes 1, 2 and 4 on the FDR extract above and the ground weather radar recording is shown below: The ground weather radar recording along the route during the turbulence episode [Reproduced from the Official Report] Cloud top heights in the area were noted to be "almost equivalent to the actual flight profile" and given the location of the aircraft in relation to two divergent Jetstreams during the period of severe turbulence (see the annotated SIG WX Chart below), it was considered that it was Jetstream-related CAT rather than of turbulence of convective origin. Once the period of significant turbulence appeared to have finished, the cabin crew were able to assess the damage and injury situation in the passenger cabin and begin clearing away the mess caused. One passenger and one member of the Cabin Crew were found to have sustained serious injuries and eight other passengers and two members of the cabin crew were found to have sustained minor injuries. The Captain contacted the airline head office about the possibility of airframe damage and a little over 90 minutes after the first episode of severe turbulence, it was decided to turn back to Tokyo, which was accomplished without further event. Despite recorded exposure to prolonged periods of severe turbulence in which recorded vertical accelerations varying rapidly within the range +1.8g and -0.88g, the aircraft was found to be undamaged. The track flown showing the point of severe turbulence onset and the eventual turnback to Narita [Reproduced from the Official Report] The Investigation focussed on what relevant meteorological forecast information had been available and the extent to which this had been made available to the flight crew prior to departure from Incheon. This information was provided to American Airlines by a contracted supplier (Company A) and the part of the forecast provided to the crew at the pre-flight planning stage in relation to turbulence during the climb showed that conditions were expected to be smooth at an initial cruise level of FL270 with moderate turbulence likely during a climb to FL350 (where conditions were again expected to be smooth again) once past waypoint KMC (Komatsu). This recommended climb profile contained no indication of any relevant areas of severe turbulence at any time during the climb. However, 90 minutes before the take-off from Incheon, a SIGMET with immediate validity had been issued by the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) for Severe Turbulence between FL280 and FL340 after waypoint GOC (Daigo) and 20 minutes after the aircraft got airborne, another JMA SIGMET with immediate validity was issued for Severe Turbulence between FL200 and FL 270 in the area where the flight was going to be level at FL270. The Flight Crew were not informed of either of these SIGMETs or another one issued by Company 'A' just after take-off which forecasted Moderate Turbulence in an area similar to that forecast for Severe Turbulence by the second JMA SIGMET which had already been
