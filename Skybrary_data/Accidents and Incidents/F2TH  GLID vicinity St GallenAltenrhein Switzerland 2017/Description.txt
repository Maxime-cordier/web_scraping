On 15 October 2017, a Falcon 2000 (CS-DLB) being operated by NetJets on a non-scheduled international positioning flight from Munich to St Gallen-Altenrhein as NJE050N with only the three crew members on board and an Arcus glider (HB-3442) on reciprocal tracks at 5000 feet passed very close to each other in day VMC after each had very late sightings of the opposing traffic.
