On 27 March 1977, a Boeing 747-200 (PH-BUF) being operated by KLM on a passenger charter flight from Amsterdam to Las Palmas as KLM4805 and a Boeing 747-100 (N73PA) being operated by Pan American Airways on a passenger flight from Los Angeles to Las Palmas via New York as Clipper 1736 both diverted to Tenerife Los Rodeos when Las Palmas was unexpectedly and temporarily closed. When it re-opened, both aircraft taxied for their flights to Las Palmas in succession but the KLM aircraft began take-off in low daylight visibility whilst the Pan Am aircraft was still backtracking the same runway and a collision, explosions and a post impact fire occurred. All 248 occupants of the KLM aircraft and 335 of the 396 occupants of the Pan Am aircraft were killed or subsequently died as a result of injuries received. 61 occupants escaped from the Pan Am aircraft. Both aircraft were completely destroyed and significant damage was caused to the runway.
