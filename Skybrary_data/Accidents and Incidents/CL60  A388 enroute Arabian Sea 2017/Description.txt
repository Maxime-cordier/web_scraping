On 7 January 2017, the crew of a German-operated Bombardier CL604 Challenger en route from Mal√©, Maldive Islands to Abu Dhabi (Al-Bateen), UAE at FL340 in day VMC suddenly lost roll and pitch control of their aircraft shortly after an opposite direction Airbus A380-800 at FL 350 and en route from Dubai to Sydney had passed 1,000 feet above. Recovery was only achieved after an upset which included a loss of altitude of almost 9,000 feet in about half a minute during which time the left engine was shut down due to over-temperature. An emergency was subsequently declared and a diversion made to Muscat without further event. Two of the six passengers were seriously injured and two others and the cabin attendant sustained minor injuries. The aircraft was subsequently found to have been severely damaged during the upset and consequently a hull loss.
