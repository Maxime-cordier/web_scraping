The Investigation conducted by NTSB reveals: At the time of the incursion, five certified professional controllers and one operations supervisor were working in the tower cab. According to the facility personnel, there would normally be 10 people available to work on this shift but injuries and illness had reduced the available shift staff to five. It is common for ATC to combine positions to accommodate facility and/or operational needs. Controllers routinely work combined positions and are specifically trained to do so. However, in this situation, the absence of a local assist controller eliminated an additional safety net established to assist local controllers. The staffing decisions made by the Federal Aviation Administration supervisor on duty at the time of the incursion decreased the likelihood that the relief controller's error would be detected and corrected prior to the runway incursion. In its evaluation of fatigue, the investigation determined that the relief controller had only 8 hours off between the end of his August 18 evening shift at 2330, and the beginning of his morning shift at 0730 on the day of the accident. As a result, the relief controller reported sleeping just "5 or 6 hours" the night before the incursion, and described his shift leading up to the incursion as a "hard day." This acute sleep loss resulted in a slight decrease in cognitive performance on tasks involving working memory and reaction time. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident as follows: a loss of separation between Southwest flight 440 and Asiana flight 204 due to the LC2 relief controller's failure to appropriately monitor the operation and recognize a developing traffic conflict. Contributing factors included the FAA's position relief briefing procedures, the formatting of the DBRITE radar displays in the LAX tower, controller fatigue, and the tower supervisor's staffing decisions on the day of the incident..
