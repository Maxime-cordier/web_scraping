On 23 February 2020, the crew of a Bombardier Challenger 605 (C-GKCP) being operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company on a private international passenger flight from Palm Beach to Calgary received and actioned the drill for a flap system failure during descent to destination. However, during the subsequent flapless landing after a day VMC approach, selection of maximum reverse thrust was followed by a pitch up to become briefly airborne and then a hard nose gear first second touchdown. There was significant structural and some abrasion damage to the fuselage but no injuries to the 13 occupants.
