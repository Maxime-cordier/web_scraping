On 28 November 2013, a Saab 2000 (HB-IZW) being operated by Darwin Airline on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Lugano to Zurich as LX 2903 and in the climb in day VMC experienced a complete loss of power on the right hand engine. After declaring a PAN to ATC and shutting down the failed engine, the crew completed an uneventful diversion to Milan Malpensa due to high terrain ahead on the originally intended route and the challenging nature of even normal approaches at Lugano.
