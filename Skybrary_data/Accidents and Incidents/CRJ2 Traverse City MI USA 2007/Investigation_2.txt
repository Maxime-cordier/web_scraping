calculation using the runway conditions which prevailed for the accident flight and concluded that the aircraft could only have completed a landing on the available runway length with the usual 15% safety margin for compacted snow conditions, which were not the prevailing snow condition. The Investigation also considered that given that the accident had occurred at the end of a long and demanding duty day, flight crew fatigue was likely to have played a part in “the poor decision-making shown by the accident pilots, including their failure to account for the changing weather and runway conditions during the approach; their failure to perform a landing distance calculation; and their failure to reassess or discontinue the approach accordingly”. The fact that the Operator had a policy that allowed pilots to remove themselves from trips because of fatigue was noted and it was considered possible that the accident pilots did not elect to do so because they did not recognise their level of fatigue until they were en route. The Conclusions of the Investigation also included the following: The pilots failed to perform the landing distance assessment that was required by (the Operator’s procedures) and that had they done so, using current weather information, the results would have shown that the runway length was inadequate for the contaminated runway conditions described.. Because the pilots had ample evidence that wet snow was accumulating rapidly on the runway at (the destination) Airport, they should have anticipated a landing on a contaminated runway and performed a landing distance assessment as required by (Company procedures).. The Probable Cause of the accident was determined as: “The pilots’ decision to land (at the destination airport) without performing a landing distance assessment, which was required by company policy because of runway contamination initially reported by (destination) ground operations personnel and continuing reports of deteriorating weather and runway conditions during the approach. This poor decision-making likely reflected the effects of fatigue produced by a long, demanding duty day and, for the Captain, the duties associated with check airman functions”. It was also considered that the following contributed to the accident: The FAA pilot flight and duty time regulations that permitted the pilots’ long, demanding duty day and. The (destination airport) operations supervisor’s use of ambiguous and unspecific radio phraseology in providing runway braking information..
