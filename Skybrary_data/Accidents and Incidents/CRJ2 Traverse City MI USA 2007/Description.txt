On 12 April 2007, a Bombardier CRJ-600 being operated by Pinnacle Airlines on a scheduled night passenger flight from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Traverse City overran the end of the slippery landing runway by 90 metres in normal visibility. There were no injuries to any of the 52 occupants but the aircraft sustained substantial, but repairable, damage, primarily at the forward lower fuselage.
