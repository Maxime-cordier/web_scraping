On 3 December 2020, when a Dassault Falcon 900 (OE-IMI) being operated by Avcon Jet on a non-revenue positioning flight from Vienna to Kangerlussuaq touched down at destination in night VMC, directional control was immediately lost and a veer to the left began with no apparent braking capability. The aircraft was kept on the runway but having suspected tyre deflation, it was then taxied clear and stopped where inspection disclosed seriously damaged main gear assemblies.
