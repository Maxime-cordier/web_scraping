On 27 October 2019, a Boeing 737-900 (4X-EHE) being operated by El Al on a scheduled international passenger flight from Paris CDG to Tel Aviv as LY326 was about to begin taxiing after pushback and engine start when an under-floor hold fire was annunciated in the flight deck. Since there were no signs of fire in the passenger cabin or during an emergency services external inspection, a non-emergency disembarkation of all occupants was made. The hold concerned was then opened and fire damage sourced to the overheated lithium battery in a passenger wheelchair was discovered.
