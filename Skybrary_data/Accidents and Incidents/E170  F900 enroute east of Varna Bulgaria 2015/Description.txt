On 30 June 2015, an Embraer ERJ 170 (SP-LDK) being operated by LOT Polish Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Warsaw to Istanbul as LOT 7293 lost prescribed separation in day VMC against an unseen Dassault Falcon 900 (VP-CGD) being operated by Volkswagen Air Service on an international passenger flight from Stuttgart to Muscat as WGT62N. Both aircraft were level at FL370 in Class 'C' airspace but only the Falcon 900 was in contact with the relevant ATC frequency at the time of the near collision.
