On 7 September 2010, a Boeing 737-400 being operated by Turkish carrier Tailwind Airlines on behalf of Tunis Air on a scheduled passenger flight from Tunis to Lyon was instructed to make of go around by ATC when an Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) Alert was generated because of the proximity of the aircraft to terrain whilst it was making a LOC/DME approach to runway 36R in day Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The go around and subsequent approach and landing were uneventful.
