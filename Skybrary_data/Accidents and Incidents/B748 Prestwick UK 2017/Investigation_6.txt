dilution of responsibility among the various individuals and agencies involved meant that no one agency or individual could assure that the shipping documentation reflected the actual condition of the helicopter and was in compliance with the DGR. An inspection of the helicopter prior to travel was superficial in nature and, although no attempt was made to verify the actual fuel state of the helicopter, incorrectly concluded that the helicopter had been de-fuelled. This resulted in the helicopter shipment being identified as unrestricted cargo, despite containing non-declared dangerous goods. The fuel hazard was not identified to the Operator or the Commander of the flight on which the helicopter travelled, and they were therefore unaware of the risk it posed. The escape of fuel from the helicopter during the flight represented a substantial hazard to the safety of the aircraft, the flight crew and those on the ground at Prestwick Airport. The containment actions taken by the RFFS at Prestwick Airport substantially reduced the possibility of a more adverse outcome. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Bristow US LLC review their procedures relating to the preparation of helicopters for air transportation to ensure that they are de-fuelled. [2018-011]. Safety Action taken by Cargolux is known to have included a number of revisions to its operating procedures and a recommendation to its contracted Ground Handling Agent that steps should be taken to raise awareness among its staff of the possibility of dangerous goods in general cargo and to improve methods of detecting undeclared dangerous goods. The Final Report of the Investigation was initially published on 12 July 2018 and subsequently slightly amended and re-issued on 15 August 2018.
