On 25 November 2004, a V2500 powered Airbus A320 being operated by MyTravel Airways UK on a passenger flight from Narvik to Norwich UK lost directional control during the early stages of an attempted night take off from surface-contaminated runway 35 in normal visibility and the aircraft departed the left side of the runway. The aircraft stopped short distance off the paved surface and the occupants were subsequently evacuated from the rear of the aircraft using normal aircraft steps before being taken back to the terminal by bus. Damage to the aircraft was minor and confined to the NLG.
