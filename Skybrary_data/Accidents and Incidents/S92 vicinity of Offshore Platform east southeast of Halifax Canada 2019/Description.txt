On 24 July 2019, a Sikorsky S92A (C-GICB) being operated by Canadian Helicopters Offshore on a 155 nm passenger flight from Halifax to the Thiebaud Central Facility Platform were attempting a visual approach there in day IMC when control was lost at 250 feet agl and a recovery from a rapid descent was only achieved just before sea surface impact with significant engine overtorque. The flight then returned to Halifax without any communication in relation to possible serious airworthiness damage. No injuries were sustained by either the crew or the 11 passengers but the extent of damage caused to the helicopter could not be determined as it was immediately withdrawn from service and dismantled and the operator ceased trading as such altogether soon afterwards.
