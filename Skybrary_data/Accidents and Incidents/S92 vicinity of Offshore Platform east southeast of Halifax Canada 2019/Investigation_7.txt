program does not monitor specific parameters established in the standard operating procedures, it reduces a company’s ability to proactively identify trends that could reduce safety margins.. Until enhanced ground proximity warning systems or helicopter terrain awareness and warning systems become mandatory for Canadian commercial helicopters that operate at night or in instrument meteorological conditions, flight crew and passengers aboard these flights are at increased risk of controlled flight into terrain.. If operators do not implement adequate measures to preserve cockpit voice recorder audio and flight data recorder data following a reportable occurrence, there is a risk that potentially valuable information will be lost.. Safety Action taken as a result of the accident whilst the Investigation was in progress was noted as having included the following: Canadian Helicopters Offshore revised its VMC offshore approach procedure and added a definition of ‘DVE’ which stated that such an environment is considered to prevail “when flying in VMC conditions but visual cues available to the pilot are not sufficient to maintain the proper flight path during flight and/or landing” and gave “fog obscuring the water surface” and “no visible horizon” as examples of a DVE.. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 10 February 2021 and it was officially released on 27 April 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
