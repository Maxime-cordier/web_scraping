The summary English translation published by the Lao Government did not include a copy of the instrument approach chart used by the crew but this is reproduced below. Note that the chart error referred to above is evident. The summary translation available also does not state which pilot was acting as PF or include the relevant Meteorological Terminal Air Report (METAR) and TAF information available to the crew and does not elaborate on the 'series of EGPWS warnings" which occurred or discuss the extent to which the AP was in use.
