The event was notified to the Portuguese Air and Rail Accident Investigation Agency (GPIAAF) which carried out an Investigation. The FDR and CVR were both removed from the aircraft and their data successfully downloaded the following day. It was noted that the 51 year-old Captain, who was PF for the accident flight, had a total of 5,502 flying hours which included 1,586 hours on type and he had been employed by the airline for a little over two years. The 26 year-old First Officer had a total of 704 flying hours which included 377 hours on type, had been employed by the airline for almost four months and held a pilot licence restricting him to multi-pilot flight crew duties. It was established that the accident flight was the crew’s sixth and final sector of the duty which had consisted of three return flights from Lisbon to Porto. The cruise was made at FL 150 and Lisbon TAF current for the ETA gave the expected weather as 210/13kt, visibility 10km, scattered cloud at 800 feet and a ceiling at 1300 with the runway expected to be wet. It was noted from the CVR that during the flight, the pilots had engaged in non-operational conversation contrary to the ‘sterile flight deck’ policy contained in the company OM. On arrival at Lisbon, the flight was cleared for an ILS Cat 1 approach to runway 21 in IMC with rain and moderate turbulence. For the ELW of 17 tonnes, the First Officer calculated a VAPP of 101 knots. Landing clearance was given with the spot wind 250/12knots. One minute later, passing 320 feet agl, the AP was disconnected and shortly thereafter a further wind check was given - 240/09 knots gusting up to 22 knots. With the aircraft still above 1000 feet agl and 15 knots above the calculated and displayed VAPP, the First Officer called ‘SPEED’ as per SOP, but there was no response. Between 1000 feet agl and 300 feet agl, the recorded airspeed varied between 106 knots and 94 knots. From 35 feet agl, the rate of descent was reduced and at 15 feet agl, the aircraft began to fly level over the runway. At 10 feet agl, power was reduced to Flight Idle at 118 KCAS and the first touchdown occurred 700 metres past the threshold of the 3,805 metre-long runway. The aircraft bounced and a second touchdown occurred 150 metres further along the runway 3 seconds later, this time initially on the nose landing gear which partially collapsed because the axle had broken and one of the wheels had separated from it. The aircraft bounced again with the recorded airspeed still 105 knots and then after two seconds airborne touched down for a third time again on the nose landing gear first which caused the remaining wheel to separate and the nose landing gear to completely collapse. A third bounce again lasting two seconds began with a recorded speed of 98 knots and this time the aircraft settled on
