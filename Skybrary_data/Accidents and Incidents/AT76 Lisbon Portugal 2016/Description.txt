On 22 October 2016, an ATR 72-600 (CS-DJF) being operated by White Airways on wet lease to TAP and operating a scheduled TAP Express passenger flight from Porto to Lisbon TAP1971 failed to complete a normal touchdown on runway 21 at destination in night VMC and after three bounces finally stopped just after the intersection with runway 17/33 having sustained substantial damage. All 24 occupants were uninjured and with no emergency evacuation deemed necessary, passengers were eventually disembarked to buses. Minor damage was also caused to the runway surface by wheel rim and collapsed landing gear assembly contact.
