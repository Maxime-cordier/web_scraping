On 1 June 2010, with LVP in force and the active runway not visible to ATC, a daylight runway incursion onto the active runway by a bird scaring vehicle was found to have occurred. Just as the discovery was made, an approaching aircraft reported commencing a go around after being unable to acquire the necessary visual reference to continue to a landing. ATC deduced that the incursion had probably been initiated whilst a previously landed aircraft was in the process of exiting the runway.
