remained unaware of the runway incursion. The TWR shift supervisor was also found not to have followed relevant regulations and had not used effective and continuous visual observation as well as use their monitoring equipment to ensure they remained aware of the relative dynamics of the control environment. As a result it was considered that his loss of situational awareness and inability to detect and correct controllers' mistakes had mitigated against effective prevention of runway incursions resulting from controller error. The Probable Cause of the Serious Incident was formally documented as “the controller in position at the Hongqiao West Tower issued a takeoff clearance to the A320 aircraft in violation of the Basic Flight Regulations of the People's Republic of China and the East China Air Traffic Control's Operations Manual in particular by not maintaining continuous and effective visual surveillance. He had already issued a runway crossing clearance to the A330”.
