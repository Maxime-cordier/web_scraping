On 21 March 2022, in normal day visibility, an Airbus A320 (B-2337) being operated by China Eastern Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Shanghai to Tianjin as MU5643 with an observer occupying the flight deck supernumerary crew seat was already at high speed for takeoff when an Airbus A330-300 (B6506) also being operated by China Eastern Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Beijing as MU5106 and which had recently landed on adjacent parallel runway 36R was seen to emerge from a taxiway and begin to cross the runway ahead. As it continued to do so, the A320 crew avoided a collision by initiating an early rotation and just cleared the vertical stabiliser of the A330. A total of 437 passengers and crew were on board the two aircraft.
