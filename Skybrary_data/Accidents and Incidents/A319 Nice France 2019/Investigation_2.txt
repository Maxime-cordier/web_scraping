to human performance errors associated with all data entry tasks. It was additionally noted that Airbus was understood to be in the process of making an automated takeoff performance checking system called “TOS2”, which was already available on the A350, also available on the A320. These checks include one to confirm that the aircraft is on the intended runway and that the takeoff performance data entered by the flight crew is “compatible with the runway distance available”. However, whether or not this system can be retrofitted on a particular A320 aircraft depends on its exact system configuration and the aircraft involved in this event was found to be incompatible with it. The Investigation observed that “comparison of indicative takeoff performance parameters for B3 and Q3 departures indicated that the only credible explanation for the calculation error was mis-selection of Q3 by both pilots”. Why the ‘departure point distance confirmation check’ referred to by the Captain had not identified the error could not be determined and it was considered that the event “showed that simultaneous independent errors were possible and that an EFB output cross-check and TORA cross-check would not necessarily trap them”. The Conclusion of the Investigation was that the Serious Incident had “resulted from identical independent errors not being trapped by a TORA cross-check or by EFB output validation” and that “while revised software with a graphical runway presentation could have helped reduce the likelihood of this occurrence, automated systems, such as ‘TOS2’, could in the future provide an effective barrier to incidents of this nature”. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 9 April 2020.
