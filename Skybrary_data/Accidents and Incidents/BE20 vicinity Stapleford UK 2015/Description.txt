On 3 October 2015, a Beech B200 Super King Air (G-BYCP) being operated by an unidentified UK company on an IFR business flight from Stapleford to RAF Brize Norton crashed shortly after take-off in an out of control condition which had begun in day IMC. The aircraft was destroyed by the impact and a post-crash fire, and both the pilot and the only passenger were killed.
