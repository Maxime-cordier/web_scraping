the risk of further ice accumulation before landing is low.. Three Safety Recommendations were made on the basis of the findings of the Investigation as follows: that the Brazilian Civil Aviation Authority (ANAC) in coordination with Embraer assess the improvement to safety that would be obtained by installing an ice detector on all EMB-500 Phenom 100 aircraft and the need to impose this modification on all Phenom 100 aircraft authorised for flight in icing conditions. [FRAN-2023-001]. that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in coordination with constituent National Oversight Authorities and in the interest of promoting safety, make operators aware of the need to give better consideration in flight planning to the landing performance of aircraft which have significant differences in performance in icing and non-icing conditions. [FRAN-2023-002]. that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) consider revising the certification criteria (by applying special conditions, for example) when the differences between an aircraftâ€™s performance in icing and non-icing conditions lead to operational constraints that are difficult for crews to manage. [FRAN-2023-003]. The Final Report was simultaneously published in both the definitive French language and in an English Language translation on 31 January 2023.
