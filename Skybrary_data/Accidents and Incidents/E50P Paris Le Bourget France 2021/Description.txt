On 8 February 2021, the crew of an Embraer 500 Phenom 100 (9H-FAM) being operated by Luxwing on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Venice to Paris Le Bourget lost control of the aircraft just before touchdown in normal day visibility. It dropped onto the runway with sufficient force to collapse the right main and nose gears and as it slid along the runway, a fuel-fed fire started. After just over 1000 metres, it exited the left side of the runway and pivoting around its yaw axis, it finally came to a stop. The airport emergency services were quickly on the scene and all three occupants were able to evacuate the aircraft uninjured.
