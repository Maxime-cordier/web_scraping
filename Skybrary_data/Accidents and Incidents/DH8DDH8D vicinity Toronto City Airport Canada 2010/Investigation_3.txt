did not remember that an approach clearance without restriction had already been issued to the (arriving aircraft).. The (radar) controller was moderately busy working the combined sectors which contributed to the late recognition of the conflict. There was insufficient time to take corrective action, resulting in a risk of collision.. The (radar) controller was fatigued, thus resulting in working memory and cognitive processing impairments.. Reliance on controllers monitoring their own level of fatigue may not always effectively identify unacceptable levels of fatigue.. The Final Report of the Investigation: A10O0089 was released by the TSB on 26 January 2012. No Safety Recommendations were made.
