- the recorded ITT reached a maximum of 851ºC - which had the potential to considerably increase the extent of engine damage. It was also noted that the non-feathered failed engine propeller would have created drag capable of compromising the handling qualities of the aircraft. Once the engine fire warning had occurred, the engine involved had been shut down and the aircraft was fully under control, the next action is “LAND ASAP”. However, for over three minutes after the warning, it was noted that the aircraft had “continued to climb for over 3 minutes” during which time it reached a maximum altitude of 2,565 feet. The effect of this was that when it turned back in the direction of the airport, it was too high to make an approach without first manoeuvring to lose height. This meant that the elapsed time between the appearance of the fire warning and touchdown was almost 8½ minutes which was noted as having been more than twice the time spent in the air by the ATR42-500 which had been involved in an almost identical event (referenced above) on departure from Budapest in 2011. The Cause of the Serious Incident was formally documented as “the fracture of a blade in the 1st stage power turbine of the number 2 engine as a consequence of a fatigue crack”. Three Factors which increased Risk were also identified as: the delay before the flight crew shut down the failed engine. the time airborne after the failure was longer than the necessary minimum. the aircraft taxied to the apron without being inspected after landing. One Safety Recommendation was issued as a result of the Investigation as follows: that TAROM Romanian Air Transport pay special attention during pilot training to the procedures to be followed in the case of engine fire or serious damage to the engine.. The Final Report was completed on 9 October 2018.
