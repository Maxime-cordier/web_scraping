On 11 February 2017, a Cessna 402 (N603AB) being operated by Air Sunshine on a non-scheduled 35 minute passenger flight from St Thomas, US Virgin Islands to Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands in day VMC with a single pilot and eight passengers on board was involved in a runway excursion at destination. When the pilot attempted to apply the brakes after touchdown on 795 metre-long compacted fine gravel surfaced runway 03, they did not respond normally and the aircraft failed to stop on it but remained within the aerodrome perimeter after deviating left to avoid an overrun into the sea. The aircraft was extensively damaged but none of the occupants were injured.
