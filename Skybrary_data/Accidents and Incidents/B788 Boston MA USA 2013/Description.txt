On 7 January 2013, almost immediately after all passengers and crew had disembarked from a Japan Airlines Boeing 787-8 (JA829J) which had just arrived at Boston from Tokyo Narita as JA 008, cleaning staff reported an electrical burning smell and dense smoke in the aft passenger cabin to a maintenance engineer who was in the flight deck. It was quickly found that the source of the smoke was the Lithium-Ion APU battery located in the aft electrical equipment bay where dense smoke and subsequently flames were seen coming from the APU battery case. ARFF intervention successfully controlled the fire with a minor burn injury sustained by one fire fighter.
