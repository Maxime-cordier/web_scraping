On 17 November 2007 a Boeing 737-700 being operated by Virgin Blue on a scheduled passenger service from Coolangatta to Melbourne experienced a failure of the right hand engine bleed during the take off. The flight was continued but subsequently, during the climb in night IMC to FL350, the left air conditioning pack failure and an emergency descent followed with passenger oxygen masks deploying as cabin altitude exceeded 14000 feet. A diversion was made to Brisbane .
