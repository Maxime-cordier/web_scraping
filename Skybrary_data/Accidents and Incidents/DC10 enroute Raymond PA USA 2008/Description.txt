On 14 June 2008, a Boeing MD-10 being operated by Federal Express on a non-scheduled cargo flight from Memphis to New York JFK experienced a period of aerodynamic buffet during descent from FL320 to FL290 in an en route holding pattern near Raymond in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). None of the three occupants were injured and the flight was completed without further event but a post flight inspection found that substantial damage had been caused to both elevators and to the right horizontal stabiliser.
