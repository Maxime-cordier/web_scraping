to just 60% of the statutory separation requirement. The Cause of the event was formally documented as “an aircraft was given clearance to land on a runway that was occupied by another aircraft in the process of taking off, without respecting the regulatory distances”. Two Contributory Factors were also identified as follows: Deficient planning by the air traffic controller, who took advantage of a gap between two landings to authorise a take-off.. The absence of decision-making (to cancel the take-off, for example) by the air traffic controller involved.. Two “urgent” Safety Recommendations were issued during the course of the Investigation, on 4 November 2020 and 11 November 2020 respectively as follows: that ENAIRE, as the provider of air navigation services, should initiate a hazard identification and risk assessment process for the recent loss-of separation events at Málaga-Costa del Sol Airport (LEMG) and coordinate with AESA (the National Safety Regulation Agency) to propose mitigation measures. [REC 18/20]. that the AESA should review the hazard identification and risk assessment process for the recent loss-of-separation events at Málaga-Costa del Sol Airport (LEMG), as well as the proposal for mitigation measures recommended to ENAIRE in recommendation REC 18/20. [REC 19/20]. The Investigation received an initial response from ANSP ENAIRE to REC 18/20 on 11 November 2020 which was “assessed as Unsatisfactory by the CIAIAC”. This was then followed on 24 February 2021 by both a revised response from ENAIRE to REC 18/20 and a response from the AESA to REC 19/20 which were “assessed as Satisfactory” by the CIAIAC and formally closed. The Final Report of the Investigation was approved on 24 November 2021 and published simultaneously in English translation and in the definitive Spanish language on 23 December 2021.
