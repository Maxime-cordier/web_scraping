than the alternatives because of both the distance and the uphill slope involved. Access alternatives to the head of Runway 13. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The TWR controller instructed the aircraft to line up when the inbound aircraft (which the departing aircraft crew had not been informed about and were not otherwise aware of) was 3.9 nm from the threshold. The aircraft reached and stopped at the HN-3 Holding Point and after a 40 second wait, was instructed to line up and wait with the inbound aircraft 3.9nm from the runway threshold. The position of the two aircraft at 19:52:27. [Reproduced from the Official Report] Nineteen seconds later (19:42:46), the departing aircraft was instructed to make an immediate takeoff and by the time it had begun to taxi up HN-3 towards the runway, at 19:52:58, the inbound aircraft was 2.6 nm from the threshold. The position of the two aircraft at 19:52:58 [Reproduced from the Official Report] By the time the departing aircraft was “approaching the runway threshold” (19:53:29), the inbound aircraft was 1.4nm from the threshold and passing approximately 450 feet aal: The position of the two aircraft at 19:53:29. [Reproduced from the Official Report] Half minute a minute later (19:53:59), as the inbound aircraft was passing 150 feet agl and about to cross the runway threshold, a landing clearance was issued with the departing aircraft just 710 metres (0.4nm) ahead and accelerating through a groundspeed of 94 knots: The position of the two aircraft at 19:53:59. [Reproduced from the Official Report] As the inbound aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 50 feet agl 4 seconds later at 150 knots groundspeed, the departing aircraft was at 111 knots and 710 metres ahead: The position of the two aircraft at 19:54:03. [Reproduced from the Official Report] As the departing aircraft began to rotate, the inbound aircraft was about to touch down and as it then did so at a ground speed of 141 knots, the departing aircraft, at a ground speed of 157 knots, was not yet airborne. The minimum distance between them of 520 metres was reached at this time: The position of the two aircraft at 19:54:15 - Minimum on-runway separation. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The applicable Air Traffic Regulations were noted to have required that “the minimum separation should have been at least the length of the runway in use”, in this case 3200 metres (1.7 nm) so that the minimum separation which occurred was only “approximately 16% of the statutory minimum”. It was noted that a total of 34 similar loss of separation events between an inbound and a departing aircraft had been recorded as occurring at Malaga during single runway operations since the beginning of 2019. These had included four events in which the crew of an aircraft on approach had begun a go around on their own initiative and eight events in which the distance between the aircraft arriving and the aircraft departing had been less than 1 nm, a distance equivalent
