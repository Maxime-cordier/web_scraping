On 5 June 2001, a Fokker F27 Friendship took-off from Jersey Airport, Channel Islands for an empty positioning flight to Bournemouth with three crew members on board. Shortly after takeoff from Runway 27, an uncontained failure occurred to the left engine at an altitude of approximately 670 ft. This resulted in a sudden and complete loss of power from the left engine and a major fire external to the nacelle, but this was extinguished during the Engine Fire Drill as the fuel supply line was closed. The aircraft completed a left hand circuit and landed uneventfully back at the airport.
