The investigation of the accident led by UK AAIB concluded that the engine failure was caused by high cycle fatigue (HCF) cracking of the High Pressure Turbine (HPT) disc. Five similar Dart HPT failures had occurred over the previous 29 years, the most recent at London Stansted Airport on 30 March 1998(G-OJEM). During the following necessarily protracted study, testing and analysis by the engine manufacturer, the evidence collected then indicated that a small gap, under running conditions, between the seal arm abutment faces of the HPT and Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) discs could result in high cyclic stresses being present in the HPT seal arm radius at the disc diaphragm, and that these stresses could result in high cycle fatigue (HCF) cracking. As a result of this, a manufacturer's Service Bulletin (SB), Modification No 1946, was issued in April 2001 with compliance date ‘not later than 31 December 2005’ and this was mandated by the CAA as an Airworthiness Directive. Jersey HPT disc failure let to the change of the SB to a cycle-based requirement with a compliance end date of 30 June 2004.
