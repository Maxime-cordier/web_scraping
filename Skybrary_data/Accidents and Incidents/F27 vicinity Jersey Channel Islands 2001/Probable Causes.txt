“The investigation identified the following causal factors: Minimal fatigue strength margin of the engine HPT disc resulted in it being susceptible to rapid cracking if subjected to vibratory excitation, such as resonance.. The abutment between the HPT and IPT discs probably resulted in a small gap being present between the seal arms while the engine was operating. This allowed sufficient reduction in the natural frequency of the turbine disc vibratory mode for it to be excited while operating within the normal speed range of the engine.. The protracted time taken following the G-OJEM event, due to the nature of the tests required to understand the cause of the failure, precluded the timely introduction of suitable preventative action aimed at avoiding recurrence prior to the HPT disc failure on G-CEXF.. Fuel leakage from a severed low pressure pipe, part of the engine bay fuel system, led to a major fire, external to the nacelle.”.
