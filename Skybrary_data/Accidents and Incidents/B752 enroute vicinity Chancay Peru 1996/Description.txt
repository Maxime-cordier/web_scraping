On 2 October 1996, a Boeing 757-200 being operated by Aero Peru on a scheduled passenger flight at night from Lima to Santiago experienced control difficulties because of incorrect flight instrument readings. A return to Lima was attempted but when control was lost the aircraft impacted the sea and all 70 occupants were killed.
