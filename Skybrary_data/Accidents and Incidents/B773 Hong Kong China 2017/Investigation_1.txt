An Investigation in accordance with Annex 13 principles was carried out by the Indian DGCA. The FDR was removed and its relevant data were successfully downloaded but as relevant data on the CVR would have been overwritten, it was not removed. The 53 year-old Training Captain in command and acting as examiner had a total of 14,421 flying hours experience which included 1,049 hours on type, having achieved his type rating 4½ years earlier and examiner rating soon afterwards based on his previous experience as a Boeing 737 examiner. Since flying the 777, he had made 13 flights to Hong Kong, the most recent of which had been just over three years before the incident. The 43 year-old trainee 777 Captain had joined Jet Airways in 2002 and had initially flown the Boeing 737 as a First Officer (3,729 hours) and then as a Captain (5,697 hours). He had been sent to Etihad Airways for type conversion to the Boeing 777 and then undertaken some limited command flying with them before returning to Jet Airways in March 2016. He was then required to undertake further training and checks in order to gain approval to operate as a 777 commander for an Indian operator as specified for holders of a P1 type rating issued elsewhere. This required six sectors of supervised line flying and 10 consecutive Line Check flights of which the flight under investigation was rostered as the tenth and final. He had made 2 previous flights to Hong Kong as a 777 Captain whilst with Etihad Airways, the most recent in August 2016, but had not been there during his Jet Airways training flights. It was established that after a week off duty, the trainee Captain had positioned from Mumbai to Delhi early in the morning of the previous day and then been provided with hotel accommodation for at least 12 hours before the late evening report for the Hong Kong flight. The Training Captain in command was based in Delhi. The flight took off from Delhi in the early hours of 28 April and just over 3½ hours later, began its descent into Hong Kong. An ILS approach to runway 07L was made with the aircraft fully established by 2000 feet with no significant deviation thereafter. As the aircraft passed 1000 feet agl, the AP and A/T were engaged and the aircraft was configured for 30 flap landing with speedbrakes armed. At a recorded 843 feet agl, the AP was disconnected and the approach was continued at approximately VREF+5 and at an average of 800 fpm with the reported surface wind from 050° at 8 knots. The landing flare was initiated at a recorded 36 feet agl and pitch attitude +0.7° to +3.25° which arrested the descent rate at 700 fpm before it began to reduce. The Training Captain did not intervene “as he felt that it would aggravate the situation” and was aware that the trainee had flown in command with Etihad Airways on the 777 and
