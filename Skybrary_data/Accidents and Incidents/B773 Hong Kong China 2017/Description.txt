On 28 April 2017, a Boeing 777-300 (VT-JEQ) was being operated by Jet Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Delhi to Hong Kong as 9W-78 during which a trainee Captain was undergoing the first sector of his Final Line Check. After an ILS approach in day VMC, the landing was firm although not assessed as excessively so and was therefore not recorded as such but subsequently discovered to have resulted in a recorded 3.2 g, prompting an Investigation. There were no injuries to the 177 passengers on board.
