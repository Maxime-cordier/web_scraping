On 18 November 2009 an IAI Westwind 1124A (VH-NGA) being operated by Australian charter company Pel-Air on a medevac flight from Apia, Samoa to Melbourne via an intended refuelling stop at Norfolk Island was unable to obtain sufficient visual reference to complete a night landing there despite making four successive non precision approaches. The Captain elected to carry out a controlled ditching offshore as there was by then not enough fuel left to reach the designated alternate and he was concerned that there may not be enough fuel left for the safe completion of another approach. The ditching was successful but the aircraft broke in two and the main part quickly became submerged. All six occupants managed to escape including, with assistance, the stretchered patient. Two of them sustained serious injuries and three minor injuries but the Captain was uninjured.
