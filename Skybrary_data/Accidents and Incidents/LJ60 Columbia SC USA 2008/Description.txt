On September 19 2008, a Learjet 60 being operated on a non scheduled passenger flight by Global Exec Aviation overran the departure runway after initiating a rejected take off in normal night visibility conditions at Columbia Metropolitan Airport. After the aircraft left the runway at speed, it passed through the 1,000-foot Runway End Safety Area, struck airport lighting and navigation antennas and descended down a steep slope before striking various obstructions, exiting the airport perimeter and crossing a five-lane road before hitting an embankment on the far side of the road at which point it was seen to explode into a fireball. The Captain, First Officer and two of the four passengers were killed and the other two other passengers were seriously injured. The aircraft was destroyed.
