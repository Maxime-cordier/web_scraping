On 27 October 2017, an Embraer 195 (OE-LWJ) being operated by Austrian Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Frankfurt to Salzburg was in the final stages of an ILS approach to runway 15 at destination in day VMC and passing approximately 1000 feet aal when a predictive windshear caution was annunciated in the vicinity of convective activity and it was decided to discontinue the approach. However, when a pitch up was made without the simultaneous setting of climb thrust, a stall warning was activated. The prescribed prompt recovery action was then delayed but once it had been taken correctly, and after a period in a holding pattern, a second approach was completed without further event.
