Investigation formally determined that the Probable Cause of the occurrence was "loss of forward visibility due to sea salt accretion on the front windscreens". It was also determined that a Contributory Factor had been "a confluence of meteorological circumstances including high marine surface winds combined with a lack of precipitation". The Investigation issued a reminder to aircraft operators that in the event of an aircraft operating in areas of high concentrations of sea salt aerosol, particular attention should be paid to the washing of engines and airframe as a corrosion prevention measure.
