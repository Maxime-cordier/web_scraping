The Operator issued a Flight Crew Instruction on 'Sea Salt Aerosol Accretion' which contained general information on the generation of sea salt contamination, similar to the information contained in this Report. It reminded crews that, in the event of experiencing contamination leading to degradation of visibility through the windscreen of an aircraft, it may be necessary to fly through precipitation prior to conducting a landing. The Final Report was published on 30 April 2015. It was considered that, given the rarity of this type of event, no specific Safety Recommendations were warranted and that a general raising of awareness through the publication of the findings of the Investigation would be sufficient.
