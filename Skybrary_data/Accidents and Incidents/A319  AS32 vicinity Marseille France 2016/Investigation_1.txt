There was a delay in the reporting of the event to the French Civil Aviation Accident Investigation Agency, the BEA, who, after being so informed determined that a Serious Incident Investigation was required. The A319 CVR data had been overwritten but the relevant QAR data was provided by Air France on 2 July 2016. Airbus Helicopters provided a copy of the relevant CVFDR on 5 July 2016. It was noted that the A319 flight crew consisted of a 44-year-old Captain acting as PF who had a total of 11,752 hours flying experience including 5,292 hours on type and a 33 year-old First Officer who had a total of 4,457 hours flying experience including 3,761 hours on type. Both pilots were based at Marseille. The Cougar helicopter was being flown by a 49-year-old Airbus Helicopter’s test pilot with a total of 9,175 hours flying experience of which 1,100 hours were on type, who was accompanied by a company flight test engineer. The 55-year-old TWR controller involved had been working at Marseille since 2011 and had been qualified for all TWR and APP positions there since 2014. His 31-year-old assistant had been at Marseille since 2007 and had been qualified to control in all TWR and APP positions there since 2009. It was established that on first contact with the destination APP controller, the A319 had been advised to expect an ILS Z approach to runway 31R. A few minutes later, the A319 reported field in sight and requested a visual approach which was acknowledged. Approximately 3½ minutes later, the Cougar, which was operating under VFR and had advised its previous frequency that its transponder had failed earlier in the flight and indicated that it was returning to the airport and tracking towards the ‘E’ reporting point (see blue position 1 on the illustration of both aircraft tracks below), was transferred to TWR having acknowledged a request to descend to an altitude of 1500 feet. After being informed by TWR that only a primary radar contact was showing, it was asked to join the circuit on right base for runway 31 and report when it had visual contact with an inbound Lufthansa A320 which was 12nm from the field on an ILS approach in order to position on final behind it. Shortly after this, the Cougar crew reported visual with the A320 and after confirming that it should be in their 10 o’clock at 5 nm, the TWR controller asked them to self position behind it which was read back. Straight after this exchange, the APP controller cleared the A319 to descend to 5000 feet and fly heading 090° and informed the crew that they were “number two behind an aircraft in their 12 o’clock at about 15nm” (the Lufthansa A320) which they acknowledged saying they “had the traffic on the TCAS”. The TWR controller advised a light aircraft in the circuit which had reported left hand downwind for runway “31” to expect 31L and report visual with the A320 on 9nm
