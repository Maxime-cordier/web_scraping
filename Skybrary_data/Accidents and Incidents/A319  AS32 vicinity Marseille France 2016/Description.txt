On 27 June 2016, an Airbus A319 (F-GRHX) being operated by Air France on a scheduled passenger flight from Bordeaux to Marseille as HOP25PG and an Airbus Helicopters AS 532 Cougar (F-ZWBS) being operated under VFR on a test flight prior to delivery came into close proximity whilst visually positioning in Class ‘D’ airspace to land on runways 31L and 31R at Marseille in day VMC. Neither aircraft was aware of the other until the helicopter had crossed beneath the A319 at which point the A319 reported having sighted it. After the minimum separation of 0.19 nm laterally and 240 feet vertically, both aircraft subsequently completed their respective approaches and landed without further event.
