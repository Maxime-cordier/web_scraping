as the aircraft experiencing a tail wind higher than the aircraft limitation during landing. Six Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that airlines (should) lay down less Cross Wind/Tail-wind limits than the manufacturers (do) in their Operations Manual.. that during performance refresher, more emphasis should be (given to) landing distances on wet/contaminated runways.. that all incidents/accidents should be discussed/reviewed during refresher/CRM courses.. that the Alliance Air Go Around policy should be revised and amended in their Training/Operations Manuals as a “Non-Punitive” policy.. during PPC/IR checks, simulator check & refresher (should) include heavy rain as adverse weather and a tail/cross wind exercise, (with corresponding) Training Manual (amendment) to ensure inclusion of this policy.. (Headquarters) may take appropriate action against the operating crew as deemed fit.. The Final Report was completed on 18 October 2011 and subsequently published.
