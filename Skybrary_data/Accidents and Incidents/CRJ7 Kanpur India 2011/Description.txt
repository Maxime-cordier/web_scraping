On 20 July 2011, a Bombardier CRJ 700 being operated on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Dehli to Kanpur by Alliance Air overran the landing runway at destination after a late touchdown in normal daylight visibility. Although an emergency evacuation was not necessary and none of the 59 occupants were injured, the aircraft was slightly damaged.
