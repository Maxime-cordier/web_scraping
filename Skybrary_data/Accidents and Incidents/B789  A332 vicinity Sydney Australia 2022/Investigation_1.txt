A Serious Incident Investigation into the event was carried out by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). Sufficient recorded trajectory and communications data were available from ATC to complete the Investigation. Both aircraft departed from runway 26R having been given the same DEENA 7 SID with the A330 three minutes and 6.3nm behind the 787. The relevant part of this SID is shown on the first illustration below. When the 787 checked in with Departures and advised climbing as cleared to 5000 feet, it was re-cleared to FL280 and continued towards the right turn required at or after waypoint DEENA subject to having reached 6000 feet. The following A330 was similarly re-cleared to FL280 after waypoint DEENA subject to also having first reached 6000 feet. The A330 reached 6000 feet soon after DEENA and began the right turn to ANKUB almost 3nm earlier than the heavier and slower-climbing 787 ahead. When the Departures controller saw this, he instructed the A330 to stop their climb at 9,000 feet and received the response that “they would do their best”. He then instructed 787 to expedite their climb through 10,000 feet and advised the A330 that there was a 787 above and they would step climb their aircraft underneath it. The A330 crew reported that they could see this aircraft. Required separation standards were breached with the minimum vertical separation reducing to 600 feet (1000 feet required) and lateral separation reducing to 2.4 nm (4nm required). The controller assessed that the A330 would have a similar climb performance to the 787 ahead having not recognised that as making a domestic flight, the A330 would be likely to have a significantly lower fuel load and therefore better climb performance than the more heavily-fuelled 787. The potential consequences of two successive flights following a SID which had a significant (flexible position) right turn to the next (fixed position) waypoint as soon as 6000 feet QNH were therefore not considered. When the A330 was observed to be turning inside the 787 ahead having reached 6000 feet more quickly, action to ensure required separation (1000 feet vertically or 4nm horizontally) for standard (and in the latter case for wake turbulence) separation of successive departures from the same runway) was taken but not in time to prevent this minimum permitted separation being breached. As the STCA was not activated, the controller did not preface his instructions with the phrase ‘avoiding action’ or communicate them as a ‘safety alert’ as required by the MATS. The relevant part of the DEENA7 RNAV SID. [Reproduced from the Official Report] ANSP Airservices Australia advised that “SIDs do not provide longitudinal separation between aircraft which are following in trail with another aircraft” and controller intervention may therefore be necessary to ensure prescribed separation is maintained. The Investigation considered that despite this caveat, the design of the SID involved (DEENA SEVEN) and possibly others “did not provide a positive method of providing lateral separation assurance to departing aircraft with differing climb performance” because aircraft
