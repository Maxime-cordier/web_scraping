On 12 May 2005, a Boeing 717-200 (N910ME) being operated by Midwest Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Kansas City to Washington National as flight 490 and climbing in night Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) experienced a sudden loss of control from which recovery was only achieved after a prolonged period of pitch oscillation involving considerable height variation. An en-route diversion to Kirksville MO was then made without further event. None of the 80 occupants were injured and the aircraft was not damaged.
