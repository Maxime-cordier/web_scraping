On 31 October 2012 a Boeing 737-800 (LN-DYC) being operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle on a scheduled passenger flight from Trondheim to Oslo as NAX 741 lost separation in day Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) against another Boeing 737-800 (LN-NOM) also being operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle on a scheduled passenger flight from Oslo to Trondheim as NAX 740 after the former had advised that a go around was being flown from the approach to the same runway from which the other aircraft had just departed. Both aircraft began the left turn given only to the aircraft on go around and continued climbing on similar tracks until the aircraft on go around altered their heading prior to a similar action being given by ATC. There were no abrupt avoidance manoeuvres and none of the total of 232 people on board the two aircraft were injured.
