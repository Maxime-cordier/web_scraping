On 12 October 2018, a Boeing 737-400 (G-JMCR) being operated by West Atlantic UK on a scheduled international cargo flight from Leipzig to Aberdeen via East Midlands was en-route from Amsterdam to East Midlands in VMC at night and had just begun descent to destination after dispatch with the left engine generator disconnected when the AP disconnected, the right side EFIS displays failed and an abnormal array of electrical system failures occurred. A ‘PAN’ was declared and the flight was successfully completed maintaining visual contact with the destination.
