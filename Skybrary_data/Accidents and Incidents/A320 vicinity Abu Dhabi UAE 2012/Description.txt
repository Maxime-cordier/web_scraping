On 16 November 2012, the Captain of an Airbus A320 (A6-EII) being operated by Etihad Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Kuwait to Abu Dhabi as ETD308 was being positioned for an ILS approach to runway 31L at destination when the First Officer observed that the Captain had suddenly become incapacitated. ATC was advised and a MAYDAY declared after which the subsequent approach and landing were uneventful. The aircraft had to be towed to the gate for passenger disembarkation because the First Officer was not authorised to taxi the aircraft.
