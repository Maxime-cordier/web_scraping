On 22 May 2011 a Britten-Norman BN2A Islander being operated by Bermudian domiciled carrier Montserrat AW on a scheduled passenger flight from Antigua to Montserrat was considered at risk of an overrun after visual positioning to a day landing on runway 28 at destination in normal ground visibility. The pilot intentionally steered the aircraft off one side of the runway to decrease the degree of potential hazard and the aircraft came to a stop beside the runway and 46 metres from its end without injuries to any of the 8 occupants or damage to the aircraft.
