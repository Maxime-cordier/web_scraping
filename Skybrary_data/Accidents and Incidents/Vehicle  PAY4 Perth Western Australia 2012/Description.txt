Whilst a departing Piper PA-42 light aircraft was lined up but not cleared for take off on runway 21 at Perth in normal day visibility, an airport authority ground vehicle operating airside to check RVR failed to comply with an ATC TWR instruction and entered the same runway. There was no actual risk of conflict since, although LVP were still in force after earlier fog, the visibility had substantially improved such that the TWR controller had been able to see the vehicle incursion and therefore withhold the imminent take off clearance.
