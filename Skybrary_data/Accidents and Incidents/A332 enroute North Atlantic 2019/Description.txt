On 6 February 2019, an Airbus A330-200 (G-TCCF) being operated by Condor on a scheduled international passenger flight from Frankfurt to Cancun, Mexico, was in the cruise west of Ireland when a cup of coffee which had been placed on the Captainâ€™s tray table was knocked over and some of its contents ended up on the left side Avionics Control Panel (ACP) which immediately malfunctioned. This unit subsequently became very hot and emitted an electrical burning smell. When the right side ACP also began to malfunction and the left side unit began to emit smoke, the resulting communications difficulties led to a decision to divert to the nearest available airport, Shannon, with the pilots alternately using oxygen. No emergency was declared but the diversion was accomplished without further event.
