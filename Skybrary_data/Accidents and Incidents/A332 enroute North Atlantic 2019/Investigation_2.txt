on the top of the cup may have reduced the amount of liquid spilled on the centre console”. The formally-documented Conclusion of the Investigation was that “a spillage of coffee on to the centre console led to the failure of ACP 1 and 2 resulting in communication difficulties for the flight crew (after which) the resulting electrical burning smell and smoke in the cockpit necessitated a diversion to Shannon Airport”. Safety Action taken by the operator was noted as including “changing their procedure to ensure that cup lids are provided for flights on all routes and reminding cabin crew of the requirement to use them”. An intention to “source and supply appropriately sized cups for the aircraft’s cup holders” was also advised. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 12 September 2019. No Safety Recommendations were made.
