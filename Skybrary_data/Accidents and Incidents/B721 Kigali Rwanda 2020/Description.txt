On 13 November 2020, a Boeing 727-100 (internally plated as 5Y-CIG but externally showing EY-724) was operating a non-scheduled international cargo flight from Nairobi to Kigali as TAK270 by Transafrican Air using the callsign designator of a former Russian operator Tatarstan Airlines (which had been required to cease operations almost seven years previously). After a late touchdown on the wet destination runway well to the left of the centreline following an ILS approach, it then partially exited the runway for approximately 1,000 metres before fully regaining it. The only occupants, the three man flight crew and two aircraft ground engineers, were uninjured but the aircraft and multiple runway edge lights were damaged.
