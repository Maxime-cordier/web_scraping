of published alert levels requiring inspection of the pitch change shaft and bearing.. Sikorsky developed a temperature-sensing plug which could be retrofitted to in-service TRPCSs to establish fleet-wide trends and on 9 March 2017 issued ASB 92-64-012 as installation authority with a scheduled compliance date of 13 April 2017.. Sikorsky has worked with the bearing manufacturer to identify and implement a number of improvements to the bearing manufacturing process. An improved end play measuring tool has been introduced, and grease is now drawn from sealed cartridges and injected into the bearing races using a syringe to ensure a more consistent distribution. The bearing is also now weighed before and after grease application.. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the European Aviation Safety Agency commission research into the development of Vibration Health Monitoring data acquisition and processing, with the aim of reducing the data set capture interval prescribed in the Acceptable Means of Compliance to CS 29.1465 and thereby enhancing the usefulness of VHM data for the timely detection of an impending failure. [2018-006]. that the European Aviation Safety Agency amend the regulatory requirements to require that Vibration Health Monitoring data gathered on helicopters is analysed in near real-time, and that the presence of any exceedance detected is made available to the flight crew on the helicopter; as a minimum, this information should be available at least before takeoff and after landing. [2018-007]. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 22 March 2018.
