On 28 December 2016 a Sikorsky S92A (G-WNSR) being operated by CHC Scotia on a contracted North Sea offshore passenger transport flight from the Elgin Process Utilities Quarters (PUQ) platform to the West Franklin wellhead platform failed to complete the final stages of a routine landing at the destination in day VMC when directional stability was suddenly lost. The helicopter came to rest very close to the edge of the helideck and although both the deck and the helicopter sustained minor impact damage, the 11 occupants were uninjured and disembarked onto the unmanned platform.
