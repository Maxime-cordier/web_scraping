The investigation led by TSB Canada concluded that the data, provided by the Flight Data Recorder (FDR), indicated that something had physically interfered with movement of the left elevator -developing an elevator split during the take-off: “At the beginning of the take-off run, both elevators moved in unison to approximately 7.5° trailing edge down at 45 kts indicated airspeed (KIAS). As the aircraft accelerated, a split developed, the left elevator essentially not moving while the right elevator continued to move trailing edge up to a maximum of 2.2° up. The maximum split was 8° at 107 KIAS.” In the absence of a mechanical problem or other foreign object in the flight control system, the investigation focused on icing. Ottawa airport weather reports indicated that precipitation, in the form of light ice pellets, rain, and freezing rain, fell during the period that the aircraft was on the ground. The weather recorded at the time of the rejected take-off was as follows: wind 070° at 15 knots with gusts to 20 knots; temperature -2°C, and no precipitation.
