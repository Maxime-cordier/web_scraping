On 19 March 2009 a BAe 146-200 being operated by South African Airlink on a scheduled passenger flight from George to Cape Town in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) experienced a flameout of all four engines during the landing roll at Cape Town. The aircraft had enough momentum to roll forward on the runway and vacate onto a taxiway and the APU continued to provide electrical power to the hydraulic system, which facilitated braking and directional control. It was then towed from the taxiway to the apron and the passengers disembarked normally.
