engines spooled down and flamed out uncommanded because the Thrust Modulation System (TMS) was malfunctioning and that the cause of this was that the aircraft maintenance organisation involved had failed to comply with applicable MEL procedures when deactivating / reactivating the TMS. More generally, it was concluded that Aircraft Maintenance Manual procedures for TMS maintenance had not been followed and that there had been no record of the tripping of the four centering actuator circuit breakers in any maintenance documentation. As a result, line station maintenance had been unaware that this action had been taken. Three Safety Recommendations were made to the Commissioner for Civil Aviation as a result of the Investigation that they should instruct the South African CAA Operations and Airworthiness Departments to: Ensure that the M&O MEL procedures do not refer to a document that is not carried on board. The MEL and Ops manual should be amended to clearly reflect the operating procedures in the event of TMS or other system malfunctions.. Ensure that the operator requires that all flight crew and AMO personnel receive additional training in dealing with TMS and other system malfunctions.. Enhance their oversight mandate with regards to the operations of the AMO, so as to verify that all procedures and regulatory requirements are adhered to..
