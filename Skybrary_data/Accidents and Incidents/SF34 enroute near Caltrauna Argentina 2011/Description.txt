On 18 May 2011, the crew of a Saab 340A (LV-CEJ) being operated by Sol Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Neuqu√©n to Comodoro Rivadavia in night Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) encountered airframe icing of greater severity than expected whilst climbing to the planned cruise altitude of FL190. Despite initiating a descent, the aircraft stalled in continuing icing conditions as they were unable to recover control. The aircraft crashed into the terrain below, caught fire and was destroyed. All 22 occupants were killed.
