On 29 August 2006, a DHC-6 being operated by Loganair on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Campbeltown to Glasgow which had just landed on runway 27 commenced a daylight backtrack in normal ground visibility towards the terminal and after stopping at the holding point prior to the intersection with the main active runway 23 for a short period then began taxiing again as a British Regional Airlines Embraer ERJ145 was about to touch down, only stopping and powering backwards and clear at a late stage.
