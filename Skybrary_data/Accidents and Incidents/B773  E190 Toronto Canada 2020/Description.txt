On 7 March 2020, an Embraer ERJ190 (C-FMZW) being operated by Air Canada on a scheduled international passenger from Toronto Pearson to Denver as ACA1037 rejected its takeoff at high speed in normal day visibility condition after a bird strike. At this time a Boeing 777-300 (C-FJZS) being operated by Air Canada on a scheduled domestic passenger from Toronto Pearson to Halifax as ACA606 was also accelerating for takeoff on the same runway and when the crew saw the ERJ190 ahead they too initiated a high speed rejected takeoff and a safe separation between the two aircraft was achieved.
