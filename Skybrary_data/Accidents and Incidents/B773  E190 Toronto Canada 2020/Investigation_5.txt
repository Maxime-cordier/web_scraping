validated and used by runway monitoring and conflict alert systems. It encouraged OEMs of aircraft transponder systems and A-SMGCS which include runway conflict alerting systems, certification authorities and ANSPs to work together on improving these systems so that they interact effectively and work as intended to reduce the risk of collisions on runways.. ANSP NAV CANADA published an Information Bulletin for Toronto TWR personnel to advise that RIMCAS alerts “may not be generated when Embraer E-jets and some aircraft manufactured by Dassault, Gulfstream, Learjet, and Textron Aviation (formerly Cessna) are departing”.. Transport Canada published an Aviation Safety Alert on the potential for inaccurate airborne status to be transmitted by transponders of departing aircraft and its consequences for RIMCAS which was subsequently updated to refer to potential variability in transponder airborne status thresholds and how these can be adjusted by the OEM.. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 16 March 2022 and it was officially released on 14 June 2022. No Safety Recommendations were made.
