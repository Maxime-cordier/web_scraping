On 10 December 2015, a Saab 2000 (HB-IZW) being operated by Etihad Regional/Darwin Airline on a scheduled passenger flight from Berlin to Billund, Denmark, for Air Berlin as AB8054 discontinued an ILS approach made in day IMC after being unable to display the ILS glideslope signal in the aircraft. A subsequent LLZ-only approach also conducted in IMC deviated below the prescribed vertical profile and was not abandoned until an EGPWS ‘PULL UP’ warning occurred after which a standard go around was flown. The aircraft then returned to Berlin without further event.
