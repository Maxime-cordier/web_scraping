On 31 October 2014, the crew of a Boeing 757-300 (G-JMAB) departing on a scheduled passenger flight from London Gatwick to Hurghada Egypt in day VMC received an Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) Advisory in respect of the right over-wing exit slide during take off. During the subsequent return to land, the slide detached from the aircraft and some un-commanded roll followed although the aircraft landed safely.
