On 30 September 2017, an Engine Alliance GP7270-powered Airbus A380-800 (F-HPJE) being operated by Air France on a scheduled international passenger flight from Paris CDG to Los Angeles as AF066 was in the cruise FL370 and beginning an intended cruise-climb to FL 380 in day VMC when the number 4 engine suddenly suffered an explosive and uncontained failure. Secondary damage to the airframe, engine 4 pylon and the right wing was minor and no debris penetrated the cabin. After drift down, the crew elected to divert to Goose Bay and this was accomplished without further event.
