uncontained failure of the no 4 engine fan hub was the result of “a cold dwell fatigue phenomenon (which) caused the development and progression of a crack in the subsurface of a blade slot bottom (and that) neither the manufacturer nor the certification authorities had anticipated this phenomenon in this alloy during the design of the engine”. Four Contributory Factors to the fan hub failure were formally documented: the engine designer/manufacturer’s lack of knowledge of the cold dwell fatigue phenomenon in the titanium alloy, Ti-6-4;. the absence of instructions from the certification bodies about taking into account macro-zones and the cold dwell fatigue phenomenon in the critical parts of an engine, when demonstrating conformity;. the absence of non-destructive means to detect the presence of unusual macro-zones in titanium alloy parts;. an increase in the risk of having large macro-zones with increased intensity in the Ti-6-4 due to bigger engines and in particular, bigger fans.. The Final Report was made available in both English translation and in the definitive French language version on 22 September 2020.
