On 10 October 2016, an Airbus 319 (CS-TTD) being operated by TAP Portugal on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Madeira to Porto as TAP 1710 was unable to land off its delayed first approach in poor visibility and its crew intended to initiate a diversion to their first alternate Vigo as pre-advised to Porto ATC. However Porto ATC then advised that there was no longer any parking capacity at Vigo and they would have to continue north to Santiago de Compostela where, after declaring a MAYDAY FUEL, an uneventful landing was then made with remaining fuel below ‘Final Reserve’.
