An Investigation was carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB) which found that the initiation of the fire could be traced to internal ignition of a pvc oxygen supply hose in the crew compartment. The Investigation further concluded that the design of the oxygen hose assembly allowed its internal spring to become a source of ignition when it was electrically energised, the PVC hose material to act as a fuel and the oxygen within the hose to promote burning. The means by which the spring became energised was sought by examination of other Boeing 767s in the Operatorâ€™s fleet. These inspections found electrical wiring in contact with or routed near to stainless steel oxygen supply tubing. A short circuit from this close-contact wiring was considered to be the most likely source of electrical energy to the spring. No direct evidence of a short circuit on the accident aircraft, i.e. no beading on wires or arc marks on the oxygen supply tubing, could be found, but most of the wiring near the supply tubing and portions of the tubing was missing. The investigation noted that the potential hazard from conductive oxygen hoses has previously been recognised by the aircraft manufacturer and new build Boeing 767 aircraft have had alternative oxygen supply hoses fitted since 1999. Issues in respect of fire fighting methods were also disclosed during the investigation
