On 21 May 2011, an Airbus A321 being operated by Monarch Airlines on a passenger flight from Dublin to Tenerife failed to follow its correctly acknowledged taxi clearance and, in normal ground visibility and daylight, inadvertently taxied onto the far end of runway 16 from which a Boeing 737-800 being operated by Ryanair on a scheduled passenger flight from Dublin to Vilnius, Lithuania was taking off. The 737 crew saw the incursion and initiated a high speed rejected take of coming to a stop before reaching the other aircraft.
