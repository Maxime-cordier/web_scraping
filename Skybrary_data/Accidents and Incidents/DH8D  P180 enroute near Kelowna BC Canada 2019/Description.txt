On 3 January 2019, a Bombardier DHC8-400 (C-FSWE) being operated by WestJet Encore on a scheduled domestic flight from Calgary to Nanaimo as WEN3109 and in the cruise at FL 220 lost prescribed separation in day VMC against a privately-operated Piaggio P180 (N990RS) flying from Spokane to Kamloops at the same level as their tracks converged. In the absence of any ATC intervention, the DHC8 received and actioned a resultant TCAS RA to DESCEND which subsequently restored the prescribed minimum separation between the two aircraft.
