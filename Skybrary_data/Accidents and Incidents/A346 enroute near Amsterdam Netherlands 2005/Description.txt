On 8 February 2005 an Airbus A340-600 (G-VATL) being operated by Virgin Atlantic Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Hong Kong to London with an augmented crew was en-route in Dutch airspace when the No 1 and No 4 engines ran down in quick succession due to fuel starvation. Only the No 4 engine could be restarted and in view of uncertainty about fuel transfer status, a MAYDAY was declared and a diversion to Amsterdam was then completed on three engines without further event.
