On 14 November 2019, a Bombardier DHC8-400 (G-FLBE) being operated by Flybe on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Newquay to London Heathrow experienced roll control difficulties soon after takeoff in night VMC. On levelling at FL200, the issues were reviewed and it was decided to declare a ‘PAN’ and make a precautionary diversion to Exeter and this was then accomplished without significant worsening of the problem.
