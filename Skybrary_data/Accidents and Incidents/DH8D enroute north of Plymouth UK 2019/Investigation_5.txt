for the parameters representing primary flight control input positions and input forces, so that their original sensor signal values can be reliably established.. that The International Civil Aviation Organisation provide guidance on the recording of filtered parameters by the flight data recorder system. The guidance should address as a minimum: Definitions for filtered and unfiltered parameters. Parameters on the FDR for which filtering is not permitted. The need to be able to reconstruct the original sensor signal values from filtered data recorded during extremely dynamic conditions and that the information to achieve this is a permanent part of the aircraft specific FDR system documentation package.. Definitions for filtered and unfiltered parameters.. Parameters on the FDR for which filtering is not permitted.. The need to be able to reconstruct the original sensor signal values from filtered data recorded during extremely dynamic conditions and that the information to achieve this is a permanent part of the aircraft specific FDR system documentation package..
