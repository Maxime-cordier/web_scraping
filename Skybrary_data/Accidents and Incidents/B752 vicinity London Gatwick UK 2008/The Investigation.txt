The UK AAIB carried out an Investigation into this Incident and their Report attributed the incident to the “rushed approach putting the crew under increasing pressure” which led to both a failure to follow relevant SOPs and to an lack of perception of the cues for the excess drag afforded by the relationship of aircraft attitude to the applied thrust both descending on the ILS GS and during the subsequent go around. However, it was also noted in the Report that “having allowed the aircraft to slow to a speed where stick shaker activation occurred on final approach, the situation was recovered by the commander making best use of the resources available to him by handing over control to the co-pilot, who retained his situational awareness”. No Safety Recommendations were made.
