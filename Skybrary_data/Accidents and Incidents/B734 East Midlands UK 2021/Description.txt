On 16 June 2021, a Boeing 737-400 (EC-MIE) being operated by Swiftair for Leipzig-based European Air Transport on a non-scheduled international cargo flight from East Midlands to Vitoria Spain as BCS48M was about to takeoff in normal night visibility when ATC advised that they had been informed that the towbar used for pushback had been left on the stand and that the aircraft should be externally inspected. When it was, both nose landing gear tyres were found to have sustained enough damage to require replacement before flight.
