On 10 November 2013, a Fairchild SA227-AC Metro III (C-FFZN) being operated by Bearskin Lake Air Service on a scheduled passenger flight from Sioux Lookout to Red Lake was within sight of and on the extended centreline of runway 26 at its destination after completing a VOR/DME (GNSS) non-precision approach when, with only a few hundred feet of descent to go, it departed from controlled flight and crashed approximately 700 metres south of the runway threshold. A combination of impact damage and a post-crash fire destroyed the aircraft with five occupants killed, one sustaining serious injuries and one minor injuries. Damage caused to overhead power and communications lines severed these services to the airport and the adjacent community.
