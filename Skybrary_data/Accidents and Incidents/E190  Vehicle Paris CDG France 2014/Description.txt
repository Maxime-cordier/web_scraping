On 19 April 2014, an Embraer 190 (F-HBLF) being operated by RÃ©gional on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Paris CDG to Clermont-Ferrand Auvergne had completed an uneventful daylight push back and engine start in normal ground visibility but as the planned pull-forward was commenced, the tow bar connection broke and the aircraft collided with the tug causing "severe damage to the lower part of the fuselage". There were no injuries to those on the aircraft or the ramp.
