flow of traffic and avoid jet blast in case of simultaneous pushbacks". It was noted that in these operations on other stands, the tug is usually aligned with the aircraft axis when any pull forward is commenced, "which limits the risks of tow bar safety cotter pin failure". It was also found that "generally speaking" drivers did not question requests such as the one which preceded the investigated collision from Apron Management Service Agents, "even if they are aware of the ban in the Operations Manual". The Investigation discovered that the origin of the 'push-pull' from J10 had been in 2008 when it had been the approved procedure when the then new Terminal opened. Just two months into operations there, a tug/aircraft collision like the 2014 one had occurred and in response, the Airport Authority had promptly changed the prescribed J10 tug operation to push only, with aircraft permitted to move forward after the initial pushback only under their own power. The following year, another similar event of push-pull collision had occurred and an explicit warning that pull-forward was banned for J10 departures had been appended to the revised instruction. In the investigated case, it was concluded that the issue of an Apron Management Services request which was contrary to an established and properly documented instruction should be seen in the context of "the common use of this manoeuvre at the other stands and the absence of any explanation of the reasons for the ban at that specific stand". Safety Action: The Apron Management Services Operations Manual was modified to make the reasons for the J10 pull forward ban clear whilst the Investigation was in progress. The Final Report was completed in September 2016. No Safety Recommendations were made.
