On 11 June 2014, an ATR 72-600 (PK-WGK) being operated by Wings Air on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Lombok to Surabaya as IW1861 was unable to avoid hitting FOD on the centreline of the landing runway at Surabaya in normal day visibility and sustained significant lower fuselage damage. There were no injuries to the occupants but eight substantial puncture holes were subsequently found in the lower aircraft fuselage, all attributed to running over a 4.5kg chisel. Two other items of FOD, a coil of compressor hose and a pneumatic drill (jackhammer) were subsequently recovered from the same part of the runway.
