prevented the situation from developing. This incident demonstrates how reliant pilots may become upon the FMS, and how essential it is to ensure that the system is provided with accurate data. The Bulletin produces several Safety Actions addressed to the operator and the ANSP. See Further Reading - AAIB Bulletin 6/2008, page 32). Because these actions have already been initiated by the organisations concerned, no Safety recommendations are made. Notes of the SKYbrary editor: *The IRSs provide attitude, heading, acceleration, vertical speed, ground speed, track, present position and wind data to the aircraft systems. For the incident aircraft, the IRSs are the only source of attitude and heading information, with the exception of the standby instruments. See the AAIB Bulletin 6/2008 in Further Reading for more details on IRSs initialisation, alignment and comparison tests.
