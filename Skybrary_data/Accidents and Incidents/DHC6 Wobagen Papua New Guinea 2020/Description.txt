On 1 December 2020, a Viking DHC6-300 (P2-ASM) being operated by Air Sanga on a non-scheduled VFR passenger and cargo flight from Wobagen to nearby Bak in day VMC attempted to begin the takeoff by setting full power and varying the asymmetric power settings to achieve directional control but this failed to prevent the aircraft veering off the runway and into an adjacent drainage ditch. The aircraft sustained substantial damage but only one of the six passengers sustained a minor injury.
