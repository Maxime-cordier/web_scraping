on short final approach the controller does not look at the radar display".. The 37 year old TWR Controller stated that he had been "busy instructing a student" when the investigated event occurred, however the Investigation found that this student controller "was only there in a surveillance capacity". The Probable Cause of the Serious Incident was formally determined as "the controller did not effectively monitor the flight progress of the (CRJ200) aircraft on final approach, which resulted in a loss (of) separation (with the departing A320) (resolved by) evasive action being taken by the crew of (the CRJ200 which had gone around)". Three Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the occurrence as follows: that a person should not be allowed to control and provide training to a student while aerodrome calibrations flights are being conducted at a licensed aerodrome. Furthermore such a controller(s) should be familiar with the flight calibration procedure.. that training of controllers be conducted when there is more than one controller on duty in the tower during peak periods.. that the regulating authority develop standards and recommended practices for air traffic control in South Africa, which is in line with the ICAO standards and recommended practice.. The Final Report was published on completion of the Investigation.
