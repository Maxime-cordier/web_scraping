An Investigation was carried out by the Accident and Investigation Division of the South African CAA. The FDR from the CRJ 200 was obtained and successfully downloaded. Although the FDR from the A320 was requested, neither it nor a data download from it was provided by the Operator. The 38 year-old Captain of the CRJ 200 had 8,724 hours total flying experience which included 1,657 hours on type. The 53 year-old First Officer, who was PF during the investigated conflict, had 3,511 hours total flying time which included 1,075 hours on type. The 49 year old Captain of the A320 had 16,504 hours total flying experience which included 1,410 hours on type. The 28 year-old First Officer had 5,822 hours total flying experience which included 1,581 hours on type. It was established that the arriving CRJ 200 had been on a visual approach to runway 26 (the ILS was out of service at the time due to calibration) and that the TWR controller had, after checking with the crew of the departing A320 that they were ready for an immediate take-off with "no stopping on the runway" had cleared the A320 to enter the runway and take off. The CRJ, by then approximately 2nm from the runway threshold, was told "continue with approach landing assured". When the CRJ was at about 1nm from the threshold, the crew decided that separation from the rolling A320 was insufficient and initiated a go around. Almost immediately after this, 32 seconds after the "landing assured" transmission, the TWR controller instructed the crew to make a go around and report on left downwind. The CRJ crew deviated slightly to the right and kept the A320 climbing ahead and below in sight and climbed to 1,800 feet. As the A320 climbed towards that level, a coordinated TCAS RA was annunciated with the A320 reported by the CRJ crew as having been "approximately 5° to 10° to the left of them and slightly below them". The RAs were 'CLIMB' for the A320 and 'DESCEND' at approximately 1000 fpm for the CRJ. The CRJ crew determined that with the other aircraft in sight and likely to continue ahead or turn left, a right turn away from it was preferable to a TCAS descent in close proximity. As the A320 passed through the level of the CRJ a few seconds later, the CRJ was observed on radar (see the diagram below) turning right 0.5nm behind the A320 which was then issued with a left turn. Separation between the two aircraft was re-established 37 seconds later and the CRJ subsequently landed from a right hand visual circuit without further event and the A320 continued to destination. Minimum separation from the recorded radar data was 0.32nm (370 metres) horizontally and 263 feet vertically. The closest point of approach occurred within the aerodrome perimeter - see the relative positions on the second diagram below. It was noted that 30 seconds after issuing the go around instruction to the CRJ, the TWR controller
