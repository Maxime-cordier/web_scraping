On 10 July 2014, a Bombardier CRJ 200 (ZS-NMF) being operated by SAA subsidiary SA Express on a domestic passenger flight from King Shaka (Durban) to Port Elizabeth as EXY 336 came into close proximity in day VMC with an Airbus A320 (ZS-SZZ) being operated by South African Airways on a domestic passenger flight from Port Elizabeth to O R Tambo (Johannesburg) as SAA410 as the CRJ 200 made a go around and the A320 climbed after take-off. The CRJ 200 crew had visual contact with the climbing A320 and restored safe separation by turning away into the visual circuit.
