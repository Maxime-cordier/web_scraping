On 31 May 2013, a Boeing 737-800 was radar-vectored onto the ILS LOC at Eindhoven whilst still above the GS after the aircraft was not adequately configured for descent. Soon afterwards, with AP and A/T engaged and APP mode selected, it pitched up rapidly after capturing the GS false upper lobe. As pitch increased to 24ยบ with the AP still engaged after a go-around call, the stick shaker activated. Crew intervention began with pitch at 26.5ยบ and a minimum speed of 97.5KIAS was reached soon afterwards. Recovery to controlled flight was achieved and a second approach was uneventful.
