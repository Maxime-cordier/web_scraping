fleet.. Boeing intends to implement a Flight Control Computer (FCC) modification which will limit aircraft climb rate when in glide slope mode and will "eliminate pitch up" when an aircraft captures a false glideslope. It also intends to add an explicit warning about the risk of pitch up to a false ILS GS to the existing FCTM text on the subject.. Dutch Air Force ATC Regulations and the Local Operating Procedures affecting Eindhoven ATS have been amended to require that "whenever radar vectors are given for an ILS approach the glide path shall be approached from below".. Four Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Netherlands Minister of Defence should ensure that approach control take into account the effect of upper winds during radar vectoring of civil air traffic in military airspace.. that the Netherlands Minister of Defence should ensure that when making the choice for the active runway, the influence of the upper winds during the approach should be part of the decision-making in addition to the effect of the surface wind.. that Ryanair should ensure that its list of reportable occurrences in the company Operations Manual specifically includes stick shaker and pitch-up upset events.. that Ryanair should ensure that when (there is) doubt whether occurrences should be reported by crew at (their) first contact with (the Company) operator, (crew should) assess the occurrence properly (and consider the possibility that) CVR and FDR (data) retention (may be appropriate).. The Final Report of the Investigation was published 26 June 2014.
