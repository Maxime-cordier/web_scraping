On 10 December 2006, a DHC-8-Q400, operated by Flybe, experienced multiple flight instrument failures in the climb in icing conditions at night which were consistent with icing of the pitot/static system. It was eventually found by the flight crew that they had failed to select either normal or standby pitot/static heaters on and they remained unaware of this error whilst attempting resolution oif their problems by completing various apparently relevant Abnormal/Emergency Checklists which made no difference. The declared a PAN and obtained descent until clear of icing conditions after which all displays returned normal functionality and the heaters were finally seem to have been off and were then correctly selected.
