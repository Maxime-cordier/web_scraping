On 25 October 2013, a Bombardier CRJ 900 (EC-JYA) being operated by Air Nostrum on a scheduled passenger flight (ANE 8522) from Madrid to San Sebastian made a hard and bounced landing at destination after an approach in day VMC. ATC were unaware of anything abnormal in respect of the landing. After seeing no damage to the aircraft on a post flight inspection, the aircraft commander elected to continue with the next flight back to Madrid, which was uneventful. However, on arrival there, the aircraft was found to be sufficiently damaged by the earlier hard landing to have been unfit for further flight and was grounded.
