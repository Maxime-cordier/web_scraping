Air Nostrum as a result of the event was noted to have focused on the introduction of properly specified and communicated procedures for their operations into San Sebastian in accordance with regulatory requirements –which were already applicable prior to the event – together with corresponding crew training provision. In the light of this response, "the Commission decided not to issue any recommendations in this regard". One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Air Nostrum establish the measures needed so that crews can efficiently and objectively assess if a given landing constitutes a hard landing as defined by the aircraft manufacturer, which would require declaring the aircraft AOG before making the next flight. [REC 62/15]. The Final Report was approved on 26 October 2015 and subsequently made available in English translation.
