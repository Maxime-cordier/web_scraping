On 7 October 2014, a Boeing 737-800 (EI-EMH) being operated by Ryanair and taxiing for departure on a scheduled passenger flight from Dublin to Edinburgh (RYR 812) was involved in a collision in normal night visibility with a stationary Boeing 737-800 (EI-EKK) also operated by Ryanair and on a scheduled passenger flight from Dublin to Charleroi (under R/T callsign RYR 65ND) and in a queue of aircraft awaiting departure from a different runway. Both aircraft sustained substantial airframe damage but there were no occupant injuries. Passengers were disembarked from both aircraft prior to further movement under tow.
