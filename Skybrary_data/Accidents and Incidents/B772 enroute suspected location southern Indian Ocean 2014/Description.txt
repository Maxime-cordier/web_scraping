On the evening of 7 March 2014, contact was lost with a Boeing 777-200ER (9M-MRO) being operated by Malaysian Airlines on a scheduled night passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing as MH370 after it deviated from its flight-planned route for no known reason. It is subsequently believed to have crashed in international waters somewhere in the South Indian Ocean. An extensive underwater search for wreckage overseen by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau was unsuccessful, although some debris was recovered consistent with having drifted towards the African continent for nearly two years from the area in which impact is thought to have occurred before being washed ashore. The Malaysian-led Investigation has been unable to establish why the aircraft failed to complete its intended flight. There were 239 people, including 12 crew members, on board the aircraft.
