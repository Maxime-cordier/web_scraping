On 26 October 2010, a Boeing 737-800 being operated by All Nippon AW on a scheduled passenger flight from Chubu Centrair to Asahikawa in day Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) was being radar vectored towards an eventual ILS approach at destination when two GPWS/TAWS PULL UP Warnings were activated in quick succession and a recovery climb made. None of the 57 occupants were injured during the occurrence and the aircraft was subsequently vectored to the destination ILS without further event.
