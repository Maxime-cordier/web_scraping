On 27 April 2021, the crew of a Boeing 737-400 (OE-IAJ) being operated by ASL Airlines Belgium on a scheduled international cargo flight from Porto to Liege as TAY4959 saw a vehicle on the runway ahead during their night takeoff in good visibility but assessed that they would be able to get airborne before reaching the vehicle. By the time they overflew the position where the vehicle had been, it had cleared to the side of the runway after being instructed to do so. A subsequent discussion between the aircraft Captain and the relieving controller noted that safety reports would be filed by both parties.
