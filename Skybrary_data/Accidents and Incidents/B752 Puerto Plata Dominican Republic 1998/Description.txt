On 1 January 1998, a Boeing 757-200 being operated by Airtours International on a passenger charter flight from Bangor MA USA to Puerto Plata Dominican Republic stuck the ground to the right of the intended landing runway shortly after the aircraft commander, flying manually as PF for a third approach, had initiated a late go around after failing to retain effective control of the aircraft. Despite sustaining substantial damage to the landing gear and airframe not appreciated by the flight crew, the aircraft was then successfully flown pressurised to the nominated diversion, Santo Domingo where an uneventful landing was accomplished. A fuel leak from the APU was observed once parked but the decision was taken to shut it down using the normal switch and not to expedite passenger disembarkation and no fire occurred. None of the occupants were injured during the landing attempt at Puerto Plata but the aircraft was found to have suffered extensive damage and had to be repaired before further flight by a team from the aircraft manufacturer.
