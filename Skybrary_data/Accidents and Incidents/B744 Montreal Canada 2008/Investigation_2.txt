further since, as the thrust reversers were stowed and the autobrake was disengaged, the directional stability which had been provided by the autobrake plus the effect of the nose wheels re-establishing normal adherence with the runway surface caused the sudden veer to the right at about 45 knots. In reaction to this right turn, the PF applied full left rudder and intended to apply left nose wheel tiller command. Instead, he pushed the tiller further forward and down, which increased the nose wheel deflection to the right. It was noted that in his previous time as a First Officer on the aircraft, such a forward and down input made on the right hand tiller would have produced a left nose wheel deflection. However, it was considered that the action could also be the result of an unintentional attempt to apply an A320-style side stick input, which would have been made at a lower and more left position than the position of the Boeing left hand side tiller. It was also noted that had the PF released the steering tiller, it would have returned to the centre / neutral position and the turn would have stopped. The Investigation findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors were that: “The placement of the hand on the tiller at high speed resulted in an `unintentional tiller deflection, causing the nose wheels to skid when rudder was used to counter the turn. With his left hand already placed on the tiller, the pilot flying (PF) inadvertently pushed the deflected tiller further forward and down, resulting in an increased right turn, causing the aircraft to veer to the right and depart the runway surface.” Release of the Final Report of the Investigation was authorised on 14 April 2010 and it may be seen in full at SKYbrary bookshelf: Aviation Investigation Report A08Q0171 No Safety Recommendations were made.
