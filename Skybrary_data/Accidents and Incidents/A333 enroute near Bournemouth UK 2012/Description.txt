On 16 April 2012, an Airbus A330-300 (G-VSXY) being operated by Virgin Atlantic Airways on a scheduled passenger flight from London Gatwick to Orlando USA with an augmented crew began to receive intermittent aft cargo hold smoke warnings whilst in the climb. The corresponding drill was accomplished, a PAN call made and a return to Gatwick for an overweight landing was commenced. The intermittent smoke warnings continued but otherwise the turn back was uneventful. After stopping on the runway, an emergency evacuation was ordered in which two of the 317 occupants were seriously injured. No signs of fire or smoke were evident to the attending Rescue and Fire Fighting Services.
