On 29 March 2014, an out of service Beech 1900D (C-GWGA) being taxied by two Air Georgian maintenance personnel at Calgary in normal ground visibility at night entered the upwind end of the active runway without clearance as a Boeing 737-700 was taking off. The 737 passed overhead the aircraft with safe clearance without the need for avoiding action.
