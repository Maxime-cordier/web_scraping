existing radio navigation aids in service once equivalent or better RNAV (GNSS) procedures were published. This programmed their removal by “2030 at the latest”.. A DGAC survey of French operators in 2016 found that only 5% of approaches were non-precision approaches (including the 2D GNSS). Another DGAC study covering the period 2009-2013 found that the accident rate was seven times higher during non-precision approaches than during precision approaches, a finding that was similar to an earlier Boeing study of the same issue with both studies highlighting the CFIT risk of premature descent during 2D approaches.. The proprietary version of the NDB ‘Y’ approach at Bergerac provided for flight crew use by the operator was found to differ from the version in the French AIP which depicted both a holding pattern and a racetrack and contained a general stipulation that when the holding pattern and racetrack are shown separately, entries must be made in the holding pattern, the racetrack can only be flown once the aeroplane is stabilised in and at the minimum altitude of the holding pattern and that if racetrack entries are nevertheless possible for certain aircraft, based on their category and/or maximum speed, then this possibility must be mentioned. The Investigation noted that whilst it “seems that the purpose of these instructions is to ensure that the entry manoeuvre is made in protected areas (and that) complying with these instructions guarantees that the racetrack procedure is correctly started in terms of heading, altitude and speed, which is particularly important in the case of a procedure without a FAF” (final approach fix), these national instructions “do not seem to be based on international regulations, are not widely known” and are problematic in that they are open to various interpretations.. The Investigation was not able to determine with certainty whether the Bergerac runway 28 NDB ‘Y’ procedure was included in the aircraft FMS database but the available evidence tended to suggest that it was not and that the First Officer’s attempts at manually setting it up were not successful in replicating what a pre-programmed procedure would have looked like, in particular with respect to the vertical profile. Given that despite the difficulties in manually setting up the approach in the FMS, the Captain “seems to have been unable to disregard the path displayed by the FMS in order to monitor that the approach was being flown as he wanted it to be flown”. It was considered that “this mixture between different practices and between the associated means probably contributed to his confusion and to his early request to start the descent”. The arrival over recent years of pre-programmed FMS approach procedures has been particularly beneficial in providing alternatives to procedures which require ground based radio aids including both 2D (lateral-only guidance as in the case of the NDB ‘Y’ approach used in this event) and 3D (lateral and vertical guidance as in the unavailable NDB ‘Z’ approach). It has also often resulted in priority being given to the introduction of
