and one was seriously injured (and) the helicopter was a destroyed". Safety Action taken during the course of the Investigation included the completion of the Operator's own internal investigation which made 13 safety recommendations covering both internal matters and other, external, issues which were beyond the Operator's control. A number of recommendations related to standardisation of VFR operating procedures in respect of approaches to unknown landing sites. These covered reconnoitring, communication, visual verification of aviation obstacles and the need for a sterile cockpit concept in the final part of the approach. Improvements in the provision of information about obstacles on digital maps, power line detection systems and in communications, training and the reporting of non-conformities were also the subject of recommendations, as were proposals to limit the extent of damage and simplify accident investigation, for example by the introduction of improved flight-following and the fitting of future helicopters with both a CVR and an FDR. Three Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration should incorporate the assessment of obstacles and other relevant factors into the standard that applies for design of emergency lay-bys and rest areas so that, as far as possible, such locations should be designed so they can also serve as safe (predefined) landing sites for helicopters [2015/04T28]. that the Ministry of Transport and Communications should take responsibility for coordinating the work on further developing the current obstacle database with the aim of utilising the safety benefit that can be gained from modern GPS-based warning systems. [2015/05T]. that Norsk Luftambulanse AS revitalise its work on identifying and handling risks associated with landing at unknown landing sites. [2015/06T]. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 16 June 2015.
