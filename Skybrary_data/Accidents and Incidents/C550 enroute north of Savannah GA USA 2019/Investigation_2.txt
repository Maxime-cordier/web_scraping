corresponding evidence of it in the removed fuel system components. NB: As a result of this event and awareness of other 2018 instances where DEF contamination of bowser-supplied jet fuel had been found including an air turn back by a Dassault Falcon 900EX after multiple clogged filter warnings had occurred for one of its engines, a Working Group to assess the risk of aircraft fuel contamination by DEF was formed by four concerned US membership organisations, The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), National Air Transportation Association (NATA) and the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). This Group published their Report on 11 June 2019 and provided a comprehensive list of both short and long term safety recommendations noting that “the risk of another inadvertent DEF contamination event is too great not to take a concerted, aggressive and multi-pronged, coordinated approach to prevent another occurrence". On 23 July 2019, an NTSB Safety Alert was published addressing the risk of fuel contamination with DEF noting that diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is a urea-based chemical that is added to ground vehicle emissions systems to reduce Nitrogen Dioxide (NOx) emissions and is not designed, or approved, for use in jet fuel. It also noted that “if it is inadvertently added to jet fuel, as has happened in several incidents over the last 2 years, DEF will react with certain chemical components to form crystalline deposits in the fuel system (and these) crystalline deposits can then accumulate on filters, engine fuel nozzles and fuel metering components and result in a loss of engine power”. A Preliminary Report of the Investigation so far on which this summary is based was released on 6 June 2019.
