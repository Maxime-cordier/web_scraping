On 9 May 2019, the crew of a Cessna 550 Citation 2, (N744NT) being operated by Air Ambulance By Air Trek on a non-scheduled aeromedical flight from Naples FL to Niagara Falls NY and in the cruise at FL 350 in day VMC began to observe a loss of thrust from the left engine and decided to turn back to Savannah GA which they had recently passed. During what became a single engine descent, the right engine also began to run down to idle. An emergency was declared and the already-planned straight-in approach was successfully accomplished without engine thrust and the aircraft was then towed off the runway.
