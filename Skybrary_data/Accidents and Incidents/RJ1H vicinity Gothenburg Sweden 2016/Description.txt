On 7 November 2016, an Avro RJ-100 (SE-DSV) being operated by Braathens Regional on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Gothenburg to Stockholm Bromma as SCW1B had just passed 3,000 feet in the climb to FL 150 in night VMC and was accelerating when airframe vibrations suddenly began. An “emergency” was declared to ATC with a request for an immediate return. Crew actions to reduce speed led to cessation of the vibrations and the air turnback to land on the takeoff runway but in the opposite direction was successfully accomplished with no further vibrations during the approach and crew advising ATC during the final stages of it that operations were now “normal”.
