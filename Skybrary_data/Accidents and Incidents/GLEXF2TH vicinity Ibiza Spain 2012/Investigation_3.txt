by Ibiza APP to aircraft CS-DNP required a series of explanatory messages due to the lack of situational awareness on the part of the crew of the aircraft.. Ibiza APP did not explain to aircraft CS-DNP the reasons for its instruction to cross the 06 ILS localiser.. The communications between Ibiza APP and aircraft EC-JIL were held in Spanish.. Neither aircraft was cleared to altitudes that ensured the minimum vertical radar separation of 1,000 ft, a separation that fell to under 500 ft by the time the aircraft reached their cleared altitudes (3,000 ft and 2,500 ft).. The Investigation determined that the Cause of the conflict was aircraft CS-DNP crossing the IAF TILNO without the relevant clearance due to not having a clear picture of the approach sequence. It was additionally determined that Contributory Factors were: the failure of Ibiza APP to indicate the reason for its instructions. the communication between Ibiza APP and aircraft EC-JIL was conducted in Spanish.. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Spanish Aviation Safety and Security Agency (AESA) promote the implementation of appropriate actions to minimise the problems caused by the use of the Spanish language (for ATC communications) in situations involving crews that do not understand that language.. It was noted that this Recommendation was essentially a repeat of a similar one made in 2003 "regarding the exclusive use of English in communications". The Final Report was approved on 27 February 2014 and subsequently made available in English translation.
