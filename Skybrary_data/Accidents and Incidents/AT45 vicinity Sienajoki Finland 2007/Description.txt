On 1 January 2007, the crew of a ATR 42-500 carried out successive night approaches into Seinajoki Finland including three with Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) warnings, one near stall, and one near loss of control, all attributed to poor flight crew performance including use of the wrong barometirc sub scale setting.
