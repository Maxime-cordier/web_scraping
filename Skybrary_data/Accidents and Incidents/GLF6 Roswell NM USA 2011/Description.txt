On 2 April 2011, a Gulfstream G650 being operated by the manufacturer on a pre type-certification test flight failed to become properly airborne when attempting a take off from Roswell for a local flight in normal daylight visibility with one engine intentionally inoperative. The right wing had been observed to touch the runway before the aeroplane impacted ground obstacles and caught fire with the resultant deaths of all four Gulfstream employee occupants and destruction of the airframe.
