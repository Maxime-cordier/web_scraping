The Swiss BEA/BFU carried out a Serious Incident Investigation which was published on 8 April 2009. The Findings included the following: an earth cable was fitted incorrectly. Its lower terminal was therefore in direct contact with the strand of electrical wiring, whereas there should have been a space of at least 12.5 mm (0.5 in) between these two items.. The tubular support to which the strand was mounted was deformed; the routing of the bundle of wires modified in this way no longer permitted compliance with the minimum separations required between the structure and other cables.. The collars used to mount the strand to the tubular structure were not tightened sufficiently.. The damaged strand contained more electrical wires than the original design because of modifications resulting from application of service bulletins; its diameter had therefore increased.. It was not possible to determine the precise origin of the assembly defects.. The cause of the occurrence was determined to be “due to an incipient fire caused by a short-circuit following several assembly defects”. As a result of the occurrence, the aircraft manufacturer conducted an investigation among several ATR 42/72 operators to find out if other cases of incorrect assembly of the same earth cable existed. The results showed that several instances of this fault had been found. On 14 September 2006, EASA issued an AD requiring inspection of all ATR 42/72 aircraft in which the risk of a similar short-circuit resulting from this assembly defect might exist by 31 December 2006. No Safety Recommendations were therefore made in the Final Report.
