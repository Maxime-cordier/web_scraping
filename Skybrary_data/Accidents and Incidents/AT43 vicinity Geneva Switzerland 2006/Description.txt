On 29 March 2006 at about 1 mile from touchdown when in VMC on a night approach to destination Geneva, an ATR 42-300 being operated by Farnair on a cargo flight experienced a sudden electrical fire in the flight deck and an emergency was declared to ATC. Despite this situation the aircraft was able to land normally and vacate the runway via an RET after which it was forced to stop. A significant loss of onboard systems was reported to have occurred due to many CBs tripping. However, because of this, the fire on board had lasted for only a few seconds and external intervention was not necessary to fight the fire.
