The NTSB determined that the probable cause of this accident was that “the landing gear collapsed during landing for undetermined reasons.” It also noted that “contributing to the accident was the first officer’s poor execution of the instrument approach, and the lack of effective intra-cockpit communication between the crew. Additional contributing factors to the accident are the lack of effective oversight by (the Operator) and the FAA to ensure adequate training and an adequate experience level of first officers for line operations.” The Final Report was approved on 28 May 2008 and may be seen in full at SKYbrary bookshelf: DCA08FA018 No Safety Recommendations were made.
