On 16 December 2007, a Bombardier CRJ-200 being operated by Air Wisconsin on a scheduled passenger flight from Philadelphia, PA to Providence RI made an ILS approach to Runway 05 at destination in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) which became unstable but was continued to an extremely hard night touchdown which broke the left hand main landing gear and was followed by exit of the aircraft from the left hand side of the runway and a slide through a snow-covered grassy area before it came to a stop without impacting any obstructions. There were no injuries to the occupants, who left the aircraft using the integral air stairs at the main door but the aircraft suffered “substantial” damage.
