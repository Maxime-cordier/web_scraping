for the GMC controller to see whether they are in the hover or on the ground with rotors running. The crew of the helicopter assumed they had been given take off clearance possibly because the helicopter was at the hold but 'in flight' (i.e. hovering) at the time the clearance was passed. Having misinterpreted the clearance the crew did not make contact with the tower controller or visually ascertain that the runway and approach were clear before they entered the active runway. The Final Report of the Investigation was published in May 2001. No Safety Recommendations were made.
