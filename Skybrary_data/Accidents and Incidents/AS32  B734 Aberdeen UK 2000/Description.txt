On 27 July 2000, a Boeing 737-400 being operated by British Airways on a scheduled passenger flight from Aberdeen to London Gatwick made a high speed rejected takeoff in normal daylight ground visibility upon sighting an AS332 being operated by CHC Scotia on an Air Test hovering over the upwind end of the take off runway. The 737 came to a stop approximately 100 metres before reaching the position of the helicopter.
