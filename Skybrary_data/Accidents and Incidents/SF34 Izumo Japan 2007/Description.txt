On December 18 2007 a SAAB 340B being operated by Japan Air Commuter on a scheduled passenger flight left the runway at Izumo Airport during the daylight landing roll in normal visibility and continued further while veering to the right before coming to a stop on the airport apron. None of the occupants or any other persons were injured but the aircraft sustained significant damage to the landing gear and propellers.
