On 7 June 2016, a GE90-115B-engined Boeing 777-300 (S2-AFP) being operated by Biman Bangladesh Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Dhaka to Dammam as BG-049 made a high speed rejected takeoff in normal daylight when an ENGINE FAIL R warning was annunciated. The extent of external engine damage to the rear part of the low pressure turbine section was not appreciated until after the aircraft had returned to the terminal, and the runway was not closed for inspection and debris clearance until 12 more aircraft had used it.
