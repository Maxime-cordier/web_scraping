a rejected take-off.. The controller failed to assist the flight crew following the rejected take-off.. The controller also failed to assess the consequences of a heavy aircraft of the size of a Boeing 777-300 ER rejecting take-off from a high speed.. The aircraft operatorâ€™s SOPs use different terms for a rejected takeoff for different aircraft of the fleet.. Aerodrome Fire Fighting did not proceed to the aircraft after it had come to a stop on the runway in spite of the rejected takeoff and the fact that it then held on the active runway for about two minutes.. The Cause of the engine failure was identified as Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) contamination of some of the fuel nozzle valves which prevented the normal function of their valves and led to thermal and then consequential mechanical damage to the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT). The mechanical damage was caused by liberated turbine blades passing into the engine. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Aircraft Operators should investigate their refuelling operations at the airports where uploads are accomplished to ensure proper maintenance and monitoring programs are being conducted in accordance with the use of filter monitors which contain SAP.. The Final Report was completed on 17 July 2018 and subsequently published. Note that the Attachments to the Report, whether referred to in its text or not, were not published in or with it.
