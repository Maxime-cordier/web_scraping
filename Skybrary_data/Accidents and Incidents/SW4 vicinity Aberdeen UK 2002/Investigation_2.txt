to fly (the aircraft) safely away (from the ground). However, if other factors had been involved, the margins for safe flight would have become more critical.” These other possible factors were identified as: incorrect operation of the NTS system and/or a failure of the feathering system on the right engine,. a concurrent power loss from the left engine,. the flight crew not handling the emergency effectively.. It was also concluded that the aircraft commander's action in retarding the left power lever had led to a more significant reduction of power than any transient effect attributable to the bird strike.. the amount of left rudder input by PF was likely to have been somewhat less than full deflection. the landing gear had not been raised because a positive climb was not seen – yet FDR data showed that the maximum achieved airspeed had been 19 knots higher than the applicable V2 speed and that these last three factors “may have combined to reduce the climb capability of the aircraft to zero” and were all a result of “inappropriate crew actions”.. One Safety Recommendation was made to the JAA as a result of the Investigation: that the Joint Airworthiness Authorities should ensure that accident flight data recording systems fitted to aircraft that are required to be fitted with a Flight Data Recorder under the terms of JAR-OPS sample and record normal acceleration data at a rate of no less than eight times per second.
