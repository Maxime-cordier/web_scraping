will introduce flight attendants to the actions of the flight crew after a rejected takeoff.. Extended the aeroplane familiarisation phase during initial training with additional familiarisation flights.. Amended the OM to require that a minimum of two “experienced” cabin crew shall be part of the operating cabin crew complement, which represents 50% of the operating crew members on their A320 aircraft which are operated with four cabin crew.. CFM International evaluated the use of a High Pressure Performance analysis tool which makes it possible to determine if the effects of a mis-assembled lever arm could be identified from a detectable shift in engine performance. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency commission research to determine how to prevent passengers from obstructing aircraft evacuations by retrieving carry-on baggage.. that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency consider including a more realistic simulation of passenger behaviour in regard to carry-on baggage in the test criteria and procedures for the emergency demonstration in CS-25.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 6 August 2020.
