On 1 March 2019, a CFM56-powered Airbus A320 (OE-LOA) being operated by Laudamotion, a wholly owned Ryanair subsidiary, and operating a scheduled international passenger flight from London Stansted to Vienna made a very low speed rejected takeoff at night in normal visibility when the left engine failed soon after takeoff thrust had been set. Just as the Captain, having communicated with the cabin crew, was about to taxi the aircraft clear of the runway, passengers were seen outside on the runway and it became apparent that the cabin crew had ordered an emergency evacuation. The serviceable right engine was still running and the 10 minor passenger injuries sustained during the evacuation included people blown over by the jet efflux from the right engine after leaving the aircraft. The exits used for evacuation in relation to engine intake/efflux hazard areas. [Reproduced from the Official Report]
