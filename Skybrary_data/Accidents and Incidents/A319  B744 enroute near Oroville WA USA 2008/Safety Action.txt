In December 2008, the TSB issued two ‘Aviation Safety Advisories’ addressed to the Canadian National Aviation Authority (NAA), Transport Canada. A08W0007-D2-A1, Wake Turbulence Encounters During En Route Climbs and Descents noted that “as shown in this and other occurrences, the current provisions for wake turbulence avoidance may not be effective in all cases, especially for aircraft operating below and behind a preceding larger aircraft while en route. Unanticipated encounters with wake vortices may continue, increasing the risk of injury to passengers and cabin crew, and damage to aircraft” and suggested that Transport Canada may wish to enter into discussions with ICAO, Canadian ANSP Nav Canada and the FAA “to address ways to reduce the possibilities of hazardous encounters with wake turbulence at cruising altitude or during en route climbs and descents.”. A08W0007-D1-A1, Pilot Training for Upset Recovery in Transport Category Aircraft noted that “as demonstrated in this occurrence, pilots of transport category aircraft can make inappropriate rudder inputs during upsets that involve high bank angles. This can result in aircraft movements that can cause injury to passengers and cabin crew and, as demonstrated in American Airlines flight 587 in 2001, damage to structure. A review of upset training programs of Canadian operators indicates that some of the programs do not contain scenarios involving recovery from large bank angles.” It further suggested that “Transport Canada may wish to communicate to transport category aircraft operators in Canada the necessity to include roll scenarios in upset training and the appropriate use of rudder control during recoveries.”.
