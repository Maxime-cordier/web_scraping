Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority develop a standard scale of thunderstorm intensity for use within the aviation industry.. [R20020176] that the Bureau of Meteorology ensure that all public weather warnings expected to affect the airspace of an air traffic control facility be transmitted to that facility by the most expeditious means possible.. [R20020180] that the Bureau of Meteorology expedite the development, testing, and installation of advanced weather radar systems to detect hazardous wind shears in high risk airport terminal areas.. [R20020181] that the Bureau of Meteorology expedite the research and development program to examine wind shifts and wind shear, with the objective to improve the detection and forecasting of wind shifts and the detection of windshear in the vicinity of high risk airport terminal areas.. [R20020182] that the Bureau of Meteorology in conjunction with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority review the meteorology syllabus for initial and periodic recurrent training of all pilots and air traffic controllers to ensure that the syllabus includes comprehensive information on convective weather phenomena and (their effect) on aircraft performance.. [R20020183] that the Bureau of Meteorology expedite a program to record output data from all available wind sensors and Low Level Wind Shear Alert Systems, and to retain that data for a minimum period of 30 days for use in reconstructing pertinent windshear events and as a basis for studies to effect system safety and improvement.. [R20020184] that the Bureau of Meteorology in conjunction with Airservices Australia develop a position in major air traffic control locations, to be staffed with Bureau of Meteorology meteorologists, to be the focal point for weather information coordination.. [R20020185] that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in conjunction with the Bureau of Meteorology and Airservices Australia develop a standard scale of thunderstorm intensity for use within the aviation industry.. [R20020173] that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in conjunction with the Bureau of Meteorology review the meteorology syllabus for initial and periodic recurrent training of all pilots and air traffic controllers to ensure that the syllabus includes comprehensive information on convective weather phenomena and its effects on aircraft performance.. [R20020174] that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority ensure that operators increase the emphasis in their initial and periodic recurrent training programs on the effective use of all available sources of weather information, such as pre-flight meteorological briefings, ATIS broadcasts, controller provided reports, airborne weather radar, and visual observations, and provide detailed guidance to pilots regarding the degradation on aircraft performance during flight through intense convective weather, and operational decisions involving takeoff and landing operations which could expose a flight to hazardous weather conditions.. [R20020175] that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority place greater emphasis on the hazards of low-level flight through thunderstorms and on the effect of windshear encounter during initial and periodic recurrent training programs for all pilots.. [R20020177] that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority ensure that operators of aircraft equipped with weather radar provide pilots with initial and periodic recurrent training on the use and interpretation of weather radar, and
