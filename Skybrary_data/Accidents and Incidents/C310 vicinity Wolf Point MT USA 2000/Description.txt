On 25 May 2000, a commercially operated Cessna 310R on a positioning flight encountered a flock of geese in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) at about 600 feet agl after a daylight take off from Wolf Point MT and one of the geese impacted and broke through the windscreen causing the pilot to loose control and the aircraft to crash.
