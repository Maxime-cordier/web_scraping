On 6 January 2018, a Boeing 737-900 (PK-LPF) being operated by Lion Air on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Sentani to Surabaya as LNI3795 and an Airbus A320 (PK-LUI) being operated by Batik Air on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Makassar to Surabaya as BTK6137 lost separation in the TIRUS hold coming to within 1.9nm laterally when approximately 600 feet vertically apart. An ATC attempt to intervene after an STCA annunciation had occurred as the A320 descended onto the 737 was unsuccessful as both calls were ignored, but soon afterwards coordinated TCAS RAs were generated and followed and a closer conflict thereby averted. The two aircraft then completed their respective flights in sequence.
