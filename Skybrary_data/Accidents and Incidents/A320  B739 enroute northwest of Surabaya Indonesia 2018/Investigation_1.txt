An Investigation was carried out by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) - the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT). Relevant data was recovered from the FDRs of both aircraft but corresponding data from both CVRs had been overwritten. Relevant ATC voice and radar recordings were also available. It was found that the 48 year-old Batik Air Captain was a Malaysian national who had been employed by the company and based in Jakarta for almost two years but whose permanent residence and family was in Malaysia. He had and had a total of 15,869 hours flying experience of which 6,750 hours were on type and had recently returned to Indonesia after a short trip home to resolve a family medical issue. His 44 year-old First Officer had a total of 2,812 hours flying experience, of which all but 150 hours were on type. It was noted that the Lion Air Captain had a total of 6,603 hours flying experience and their First Officer had a total of 2,502 hours flying experience. The approach radar controller involved had over 20 years experience. The Batik Air A320 Captain was acting as PM and correctly read back a series of descent clearances including the one to descend to 11,000 feet QNH. Eight seconds after the correct readback had been given, 11,000 feet was set on the altitude selector. Then, one second later, the selected altitude was changed from 11,000 feet to 10,000 feet. At this point, the Batik A320 was descending through 13,200 feet QNH with a 1,050 fpm rate of descent and the Lion Air 737 was passing 10,300 feet QNH and about to level at 10,000 feet as cleared. As it then did so, the Batik Air A320 had just passed 11,000 feet and was continuing to descend. Six seconds later, the Batik Air A320 received a TCAS TA on the 737 below but it continued to descend albeit at a reduced rate. After a further 8 seconds, an STCA alert resulting from the conflict led the radar controller to instruct the A320 to “maintain 11,000 feet” to which there was no response. As this instruction was repeated - and again ignored - the A320 received another TA as it passed 10,600 feet and at the same time the 737, still descending FL100 as cleared, received a TCAS RA ‘DON’T CLIMB’. At this point, separation was 2.8nm and 400 feet. One second later, the A320 received a TCAS RA ‘DON’T DESCEND’ and levelled off at 10,500 feet. The RAs continued for 20 seconds until ‘Clear of Conflict’ was annunciated when the minimum lateral separation (5nm) was reached. For the next ten seconds, the PM Batik Air Captain then tried to convince the controller that he had been cleared to descend to 10,000 feet but this was correctly refuted by the controller who then instructed the A320 to climb back to its cleared altitude of 11,000 feet. The remainder of the two aircraft’s flights were without further event and they later landed
