from the leading edge towards the trailing edge.” During the Investigation, the Operator issued a ‘Notice to Aircrew’ to all pilots on their Dornier 328 fleet to which was attached the relevant extract from the AFM. This advised that "If the aeroplane is treated with de/anti-icing fluids, irrespective of ambient conditions or temperatures and even if non-icing conditions exist: V1, Vr, V2 and Vsec with horn heat on and related takeoff performance for icing conditions MUST be used” (Vsec = speed for single-engined climb)." Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Joint Aviation Authorities should contact all Dornier 328 Type Rating Training Organisations within JAA member States and emphasise the need to train pilots to use icing speeds following de-icing/anti-icing with thickened fluids, even when in non-icing conditions.. (2006-072) that EuroManx should provide annual pre-winter flying awareness refresher training and information to all its flight crews. This refresher training should emphasise the need to use the correct icing speeds even in non icing conditions.. (2006-073) The [Final Report] of the Investigation was published on 5 October 2006.
