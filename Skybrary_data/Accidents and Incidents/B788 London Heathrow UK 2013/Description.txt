On 12 July 2013, a Boeing 787-8 (ET-AOP) being operated by Ethiopian Airways and remotely parked at London Heathrow caught fire whilst unoccupied and unpowered. After initial difficulties, the airport RFFS eventually succeeded in extinguishing the fire after almost half an hour. Damage sustained to the aircraft was limited but included externally visible evidence of structural damage to the composite fuselage.
