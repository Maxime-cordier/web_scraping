to his inexperience and underdeveloped CRM skills.. The autopilot probably disengaged automatically because a servo reached its torque limit, allowing the aircraft to roll and dive abruptly as a result of the applied rudder trim.. The applied rudder trim probably contributed to the crew’s inability to recover control of the aircraft.. The crew’s other control inputs to recover from the spiral dive were not optimal, and contributed to the structural failure of the aircraft.. The flying conditions of a dark night with cloud cover below probably hindered the crew’s early perception of the developing upset.. The AFM [Aircraft Flight Manual] limitation on use of the autopilot above 20 000 ft should have led to the crew disconnecting it when climbing the aircraft above that altitude.. If the aircraft had been manually flown during the fuel-balancing manoeuvre, the upset would probably have not occurred.”. Following the accident, the operator initiated safety actions including Notice to Pilots advising that forthwith the SOP was to give the refueller the volume of fuel to be put into each wing tank to achieve a balanced load prior to engine start, in accordance with the Pre-Start checklist, Metro Training Manual and AFM. The Notice emphasised that it was not acceptable to put the required fuel uplift into one tank only with the intention of balancing the fuel later. The importance of not compromising safety by rushing checks was also mentioned in the Notice.. Operator amended the Metro checklist to add to the Line-up and Approach checklists the item “crossflow closed”.. Operator amended the autopilot Standard Operating Procedures section of the company Metro Training Manual. The Report's recommendations beginning on page 41 focus on institutional issues (see Further Reading).
