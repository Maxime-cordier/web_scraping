On 3 May 2005, Fairchild-Swearingen SA227 (Metro III), being operated by Airwork (NZ) Limited, was on a night air transport freight flight when there was a loss of control which developed into a spiral dive. The crew did not recover control and the aircraft became overstressed which resulted in an in-flight break up and terrain impact, killing both crewmembers.
