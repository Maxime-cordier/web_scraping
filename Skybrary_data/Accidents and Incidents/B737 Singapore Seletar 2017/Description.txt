On 16 November 2017, a Boeing 737-700 (VP-CAM) being operated by MyJet Asia on a non-revenue positioning flight from Singapore Seletar to Beijing was observed by the TWR controller to get airborne only at the very end of the 1,836 metre-long runway 03 and then perform an extremely shallow climbout in day VMC. After an inspection was requested by the controller, it was found that 10 approach lights had been damaged. The flight crew were advised but reported everything appeared to be operating normally and decided to continue with the intended flight. After completion of the flight, damage consistent with lighting impact by the left main landing gear wheels was found.
