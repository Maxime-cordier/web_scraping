On 18 June 2016, the two-man crew of a Pilatus PC12 (VH-OWA) being operated on a medical retrieval flight from Meekatharra to Paraburdoo in Western Australia by an unspecified operator in night VMC with line training in progress and one passenger on board observed a sudden change in the SVS image on both their PFDs soon after take-off. This included the depiction of the ground rising to meet the altitude of the aircraft without any related alerting. The Pilot Flying initially responded to this with a sudden increase in pitch, but after an alert from the other pilot he restored normal pitch. A normal SVS presentation returned as the aircraft continued to climb.
