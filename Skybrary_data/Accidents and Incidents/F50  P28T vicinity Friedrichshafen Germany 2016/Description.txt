On 21 April 2016, a Fokker F50 (OO-VLF) being operated by VLM on a scheduled international passenger flight from Berlin Tegel to Friedrichshafen as VLM22TX and a Piper PA28 (OK-ELL) being privately operated under VFR on an international passenger flight from Brno to Friedrichshafen were involved in a near mid-air collision at 4,000 feet QNH approximately 10 nm north east of their destination in day VMC. Minimum separation after the initiation of lateral avoiding action by the F50 was 0.5 nm laterally and 100 feet vertically. Both aircraft subsequently completed their flights without further event.
