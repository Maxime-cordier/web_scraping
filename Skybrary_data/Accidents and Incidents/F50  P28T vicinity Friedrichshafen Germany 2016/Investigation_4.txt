while a light aircraft flying under visual flight rules was in radio contact with aerodrome control”. It was further identified that the following six Contributory Factors, documented in chronological order, collectively facilitated the dangerous convergence: The operational concept consisting of the simultaneous approach of traffic under visual and instrument flight rules during the trade fair entailed systemic risks.. The pilots of both aircraft were not in radio contact with the same air traffic control unit.. The traffic guidance within the aerodrome control service concerning the light aircraft approaching under visual flight rules was coordinated inadequately.. The traffic alert and collision avoidance system on board the commercial aircraft did not generate a resolution advisory due to a lateral avoidance manoeuvre.. The traffic information provided by the aerodrome control to the pilot of the light aircraft was given too late.. The pilots of both aircraft only acquired a late visual contact of each other.. In addition, a general Contributory Factor was identified as “the current classification (E) of the airspace in which the dangerous convergence took place”. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the German Air Traffic Controlling Office (BAF) should, in cooperation with the German ANSP (DFS), the Swiss ANSP (Skyguide) and the Austrian ANSP (Austro Control), examine the extent to which the operating concept applied during the aviation exhibition at Friedrichshafen could be improved upon.. It was noted that no Safety Action had been taken since the occurrence of the investigated Serious Incident. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed on 10 July 2018 and subsequently published online on 1 October 2018. The conflict was classified as a Category ‘A’ AIRPROX.
