On 10 March 2017, a Boeing 787-8 (VT-ANT) being operated by Air India on a scheduled international passenger flight from Ahmedabad to London Heathrow as AI-171 was out of contact with ATC for well over an hour whilst in the cruise at FL400 in Romanian and Hungarian airspace in day VMC whilst the Captain was taking in-seat controlled rest and the First Officer was acting as PF without supervision. After waking up, the Captain saw a fighter aircraft in close proximity and this prompted the restoration of normal ATC communications with continued fighter escort until the flight began descent to its destination.
