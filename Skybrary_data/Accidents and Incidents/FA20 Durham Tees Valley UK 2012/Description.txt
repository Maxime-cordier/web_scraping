On 9 August 2012, a Fan Jet Falcon 20 being operated by Cobham Leasing Airlines departing Durham Tees Valley on an aerial work detail in normal daylight visibility overran runway 23 after initiating a high speed rejected take off after sighting a single bird ahead. The three occupants were uninjured but damage to the aircraft including ingestion of mud and stones into both engines rendered it unfit for further flight until repaired.
