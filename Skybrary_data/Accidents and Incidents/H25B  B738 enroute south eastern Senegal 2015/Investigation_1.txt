An Investigation by the BEA Senegal was commenced the same day. A search for wreckage from the 125 was conducted but was not successful. The FDR and 2-hour CVR from the 737 were removed and downloaded by the BEA France between the 26 and 30 October 2015. The FDR data showed that the aircraft had been level at FL 350 throughout its cruise with the AP and A/T engaged and also "confirmed normal function of both the transponder and TCAS". An ATC radar recording was available which showed most of the post-collision flight path of the 125 and the recorded R/T exchanges between ATC and both aircraft were also available. Both 125 pilots were Algerian nationals with foreign licence validations. The 56 year-old Captain had 7,658 hours total flying experience which included 2,200 hours on type. He had flown a total of 195 hours during the six months prior to the accident. The 35 year-old First Officer had 3,339 hours total flying experience and had flown a total of 136 hours during the six months prior to the accident. The 45 year-old 737 Captain was a Ukrainian national and a second 45 year-old Captain, of Italian nationality and holding an Equatorial Guinea-issued licence was also on board but his status was not documented. Neither was the flying experience of either Captain. The 33 year-old 737 First Officer was an Italian national holding an Equatorial Guinea licence who had 585 hours total flying experience. It was established that after departing Ouagadougou, the 125 had climbed to FL340 to cruise but had subsequently requested and been cleared to FL380 for weather avoidance by Bamako ACC. On encountering significant turbulence at FL 380, a request to climb to FL400 was approved but when this level was still turbulent, a descent back to FL340 was requested. FL 360 was initially approved and then the crew requested FL340 which they reported reaching and maintaining. As the aircraft approached the Mali/Senegal border at waypoint GATIL after passing ENINO at FL 340 on ATS route UA 601 (see the chart extract below), an approval for a deviation left of track for weather avoidance had been obtained. First contact of the 125 with Dakar Control, in an area without radar or CPDLC coverage, was a request for continued deviation to the left of track for weather avoidance. The initial ATC response was to maintain FL340, report passing the 'TD' (Tambacounda) VOR and squawk 5040. The response from the 125 crew acknowledged the next required report and confirmed the squawk but not the 'maintain FL 340' which required a further request from the controller before it was obtained. Three minutes later, the crew asked for confirmation that the squawk was 5040 and this was confirmed. There were no further calls from the 125 but as it entered the area of radar coverage 10 minutes after the time of the collision, it was seen on the flight planned route at FL 350 instead of the assigned FL 340 and with
