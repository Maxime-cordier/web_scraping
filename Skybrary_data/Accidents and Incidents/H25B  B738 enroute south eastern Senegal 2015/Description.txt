On 5 September 2015, a Boeing 737-800 (3C-LLY) being operated by CEIBA Intercontinental on a passenger flight from Dakar to Malabo, Equatorial Guinea with a planned intermediate stop in Cotonou was in the cruise at FL 350 in day VMC when it reported a mid-air collision with an opposite direction aircraft. This aircraft was an HS 125-700 (6V-AIM) being operated by Senegalair on a medevac flight from Ouagadougou to Dakar and cleared to maintain FL 340 so as to pass the opposite direction 737 with 1,000 feet clearance. The 737 continued a reportedly normal flight overflying Cotonou direct to Malabo despite sustaining wingtip damage but there was no further radio contact with the HS 125. It was subsequently observed on radar maintaining FL350 and progressing westwards on the flight planned track before passing over Dakar and continuing offshore on the same track before eventually beginning an apparently uncontrolled descent into the sea. No wreckage was found and the 7 crew and passengers on board were presumed to have been killed.
