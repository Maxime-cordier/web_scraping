On 30 March 2009, a Fairchild SA227 Metroliner III was being operated by Airwork (NZ) on a public transport air ambulance positioning flight to New Plymouth at night with the medical team on board. The visual approach at destination was rushed and unstable with the distraction of a minor propeller speed malfunction and with un-actioned GPWS/TAWS warnings caused by excessive sink and terrain closure rates. After a hard touchdown close to the beginning of the runway, directional control was lost and the aircraft left the runway to the side before continuing parallel to it for the rest of the landing roll. There was no damage to the aircraft or injury to the occupants but minor damage occurred to runway lighting fixtures.
