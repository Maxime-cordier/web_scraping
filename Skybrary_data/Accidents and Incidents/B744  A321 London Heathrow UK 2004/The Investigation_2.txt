aviation industry. In particular operating jet or propeller engines can cause fatal or serious injuries and extensive damage to equipment or other aircraft.', This document neither expands the information above for the towing of aircraft in airport manoeuvring areas, nor does it specifically identify the hazards, such as wingtip clearance, nor does it provide guidance on how to avoid them. Also omitted from these documents is any guidance to the towing crews on what action should be taken, if there is need to obtain clarification or assistance should a potential hazard present itself. It is therefore recommended that:” Safety Recommendation 2004-73 “The Civil Aviation Authority should enhance CAP 642 Airside Safety Management to include guidance on the responsibilities of towing crews of aircraft under tow, especially with regard to obstacle and wingtip clearance in aircraft manoeuvring areas so that such clearance is not inferred from ATC clearances to tow an aircraft. The operator, who had in turn been trained by the airport authority, provided the training for the towing crew. Nowhere in this training had there been any emphasis on the responsibilities of the crew whilst the aircraft is under tow, for maintaining a look out and ensuring obstacle and wing tip clearance. It is therefore recommended:” Safety Recommendation 2004-74 “British Airports Authority plc should ensure that training of individuals for the issue of 'C' manoeuvring area licences, includes the responsibilities of drivers for obstacle clearance and that ATC clearance instructions does not infer obstacle or wingtip clearance.”
