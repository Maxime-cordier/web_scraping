On 8 November 2017, an LF 507-1F engined Avro RJ85 (ZS-ASW) being operated by Airlink on a scheduled international passenger flight from Harare to Johannesburg as LNK103 was in the cruise at FL340 in day VMC when there was a sudden loud bang and a yaw to the right immediately afterwards. Flight deck indications showed that both left side engines (outer number 1 and inner number 2) had failed. The crew followed the prescribed procedures and a MAYDAY was declared to ATC. After assessing the situation it was decided to continue to destination and this was accomplished without further event and there were no injuries to any of the 38 occupants.
