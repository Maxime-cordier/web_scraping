which will have had the potential to cause accidents”. It was further observed that the overall conclusions are that these events occur irrespective of the airline or aircraft type and that the errors are attributable to various different origins. It was noted that the fact that “there is no single solution to ensure that such errors are always prevented or captured” had led in the past to the suggestion of a Takeoff Performance Monitoring System (TPMS) operating by detection of aircraft acceleration and generating an alert if a takeoff was not progressing as expected. The Investigating Agency was noted as having made two Safety Recommendations to European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in respect of the development of a specification such takeoff performance monitoring systems and the mandating of their use in their Final Report on a serious incident involving an Airbus A330 operated by the same airline in 2008 - A332, Montego Bay Jamaica, 2008 where the input of a weight lower than the actual one nearly led to a runway excursion. The Final Report of the Investigation: AAIB Bulletin: 12/2011 EW/G2011/04/29 was published on 8 December 2011. No new Safety Recommendations were made but the two previous Safety Recommendations noted above and made to EASA in 2009 were restated in full with the remark that EASA “has not yet accepted these Safety Recommendations but they are under consideration”.
