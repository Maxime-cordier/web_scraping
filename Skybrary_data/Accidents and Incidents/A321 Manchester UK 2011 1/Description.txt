On 29 April 2011, an Airbus A321-200 being operated by Thomas Cook Airlines on a passenger service from Manchester UK to Iraklion, Greece took off in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) but failed to establish a climb at the expected speed until the aircraft pitch attitude was reduced below that prescribed for the aircraft weight which had been entered into the Flight Management System. No abnormal manoeuvres occurred and none of the 231 occupants were injured.
