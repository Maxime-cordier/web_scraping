The Internal investigation of the event by ANSP ENAIRE resulted in a modified LoA effective from 31 December 2019 which included requirements that “the transfer of control takes place at the boundary of the AoR” and specified that “communications transfers will imply that the traffic is being transferred free for ascent in the case of take-offs, for descent in the case of arrivals and for turning in both situations”. However, this revision still allowed the accepting unit the freedom to turn aircraft, albeit now to a maximum of 45° only. However, the Investigation noted that the continued option for a receiving unit to turn traffic accepted when still within the previous sector’s AoR would, even with the 45° restriction, have been unlikely to have prevented the loss of separation under investigation and concluded that “the measures taken by ENAIRE were not sufficient to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future”. The Cause of the event was determined as the early transfer of the Ryanair Boeing 737 from the Seville ACC SM4 sector to the Seville Airport frequency resulting in a loss of separation between it and the Air Europe 737 inbound to Malaga. A Contributory Factor was considered to have been “the Letter of Agreement between the units, which allowed them to make changes to an aircraft’s course while it remains in the previous control area”. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that ENAIRE makes the necessary changes to ensure that Seville ACC and Malaga APP controllers do not instruct aircraft to turn before they are in their Area of Responsibility unless there has been prior coordination between the units.

The Final Report of the Investigation was approved on 28 July 2021 and then released online simultaneously in both the definitive Spanish version and in English translation on 29 November 2021.
