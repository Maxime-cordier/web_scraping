On 14 August 2018, an Airbus A320 (VH-FNP) being operated by Virgin Australia Regional Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Perth to Christmas Island with an augmented crew due to the length of the flight duty period began its departure from Perth in day VMC with the main landing gear ground locking pin sleeves still installed after removal of the their locking pins. One sleeve then fell out, unseen, during pushback and the other fell out, again unseen, during takeoff. Reports of FOD on the runway eventually led to the location of one sleeve and the other was subsequently recovered from the apron. The intended flight was completed without further event and the aircraft was subsequently found to be undamaged.
