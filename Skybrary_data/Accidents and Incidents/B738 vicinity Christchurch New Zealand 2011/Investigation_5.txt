his performance on the flight.. The presence of the Check Captain on the flight deck and its effect on crew dynamics and communications had not been thoroughly discussed during the pre-flight briefing, which had the potential to blur the boundaries of individual involvement in the flight deck operations.. The Operator had not followed its own procedures for managing the previously identified performance issues with the Captain. This resulted in his continuing with non-conforming practices, virtually unchallenged.. One Safety Recommendation was made as follows: that the Director of Civil Aviation should note that the pilot check process can interfere with safe flight operations if not properly managed, and raise this potential safety issue with industry in the most appropriate manner.
