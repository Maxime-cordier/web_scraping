On 10 January 2011, a Boeing 737-300 being operated by Europe Airpost on a positioning flight from Montpelier to Toulouse with only the flight crew on board had just rotated for take off on runway 31R in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when the leading edge slats extended from the Intermediate position to the Fully Extended position and the left stick shaker was activated. Initial climb proceeded and shortly afterwards, the slats returned to their previous position and the stick shaker activation stopped. It was decided to continue the planned flight which was uneventful thereafter.
