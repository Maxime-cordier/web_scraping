On 13 April 2010, a Rolls Royce Trent 700-powered Airbus A330-300 being operated by Hong Kong-based Operator Cathay Pacific on a scheduled passenger flight from Surabaya, Indonesia to Hong Kong experienced difficulties in controlling the thrust from both engines whilst en route and as the initial difficulties worsened, a PAN and then a MAYDAY was declared. A successful high speed landing was subsequently made in normal daylight visibility on runway 07L with asymmetric thrust settings which could not be altered resulting in minor damage to the aircraft and a landing gear fire which prompted an emergency evacuation in which 62 of the 322 occupants sustained minor injuries and one sustained serious injuries.
