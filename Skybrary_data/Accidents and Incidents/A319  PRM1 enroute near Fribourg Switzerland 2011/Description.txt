On 10 June 2011, in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), an Airbus A319 being operated by German Wings on a scheduled passenger flight from Barcelona to Stuttgart lost separation against a Raytheon 390 being operated by German air taxi company Hahn Air on a non scheduled passenger flight from Zurich to Palma. Late ATC attempts to resolve the conflict were pre-empted by co-ordinated TCAS RAs but during them, the Hahn Air crew elected to reverse their initial TCAS RA climb whilst it was still annunciated in favour of an ATC instruction to descend. This action very significantly reduced the separation which would otherwise have prevailed.
