An Investigation was carried out by the Swiss AIB. The Investigation was based upon ATC R/T and radar recordings (including mode ‘S’ downlink data from both aircraft) and on the downloaded Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data from the A319. It was noted that the conflict had occurred in Class ‘C’ airspace and that the aircraft involved had been working sectors under the control of two different ACCs throughout the sequence which led to the conflict. It was established that the A319 had been in descent and had been cleared to FL250 by a Geneva ACC controller who had then entered FL280 into the system before handing the aircraft over to Zurich ACC with whom there was a standing agreement for silent transfers at FL 280 without explicit coordination. Neither he nor his colleagues on the sector noticed the discrepancy between the flight level clearance given by radio and the one entered into the system. When the A319 crew subsequently checked in with Zurich ACC in the descent to FL250 and gave this cleared level, neither of the two controllers involved noticed that the level stated was different to the one on the system. Meanwhile, the Raytheon 390 was in the climb out of Zurich on an almost opposite track and had been cleared to climb to FL 270 by Geneva ACC. As the A319 descended below FL280 towards the climbing Raytheon 390, STCAs were activated successively in both ACCs. Two seconds prior to the (later) Geneva STCA activation, the A319 received a TCAS RA to “Maintain Vertical Speed, Crossing Maintain”. This was followed and resulted in descent at 1500-2000 fpm contrary to an ATC instruction which had just been received to stop descent at FL270. A TCAS RA was annunciated for the Raytheon 390 two seconds later to “Climb crossing climb” which was followed and required a slight increase in the prior rate of climb to achieve 1500-2000fpm. However, 9 seconds after this annunciation and with it still displayed, Geneva instructed the aircraft to descend to FL 260 and the crew disregarded the RA - which continued unchanged for a further 23 seconds - and began a descent at a higher rate than the A319 which then received an RA to “increase descent”. Two seconds later, the radar recording of position at 4 second intervals (see the diagram reproduced below) showed the A319 crossing 75 feet below and 1.3nm ahead of the Raytheon 390 as it approached from the right with the CPA reached four seconds after that when the 319 was 50 feet below and 0.6nm horizontally from the 390. As the 319 had crossed ahead of the other aircraft with both descending, its RA had changed to a corrective “Climb, Climb Now” requiring a climb rate of 1500-2000 fpm with the 390 RA changing at the same time to “monitor vertical speed”. Thereafter, separation increased as their tracks diverged and “Clear of Conflict” was annunciated onboard both aircraft 8 seconds later. Despite flying in VMC and having identified
