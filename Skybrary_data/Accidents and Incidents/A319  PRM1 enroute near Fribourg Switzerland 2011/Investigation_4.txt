as a consequence of that earlier investigation. It was noted that “in the present case, the (competency validation) procedure adopted since then was applied as a trial for the first time and the impression is that it enabled an improvement to be achieved”. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Federal Office of Civil Aviation should ensure that within Swiss air traffic control a system is implemented which is able, in the event of a discrepancy between the [data system entry of the] air traffic control altitude clearance (cleared flight level) and the setting in the aircraft (selected altitude), to trigger an alarm. [No 462]. The Final Report was completed on 17 July 2013 and approved by the Swiss AIB on 17 October 2013.
