On 27 July 2019, a Boeing 767-300 (VH-EXZ) being operated by Tasman Cargo Airlines on an international cargo flight from Auckland to Sydney was taxiing for departure when a fuel configuration advisory was annunciated. The crew decided there was no evidence of a fuel leak and continued the departure. Their intended in-flight re-balancing was then delayed until the applicable imbalance limits had been exceeded. The fault was not recorded after flight and the aircraft continued to operate with the operatorâ€™s maintenance organisation remaining unaware of the fault for several days.
