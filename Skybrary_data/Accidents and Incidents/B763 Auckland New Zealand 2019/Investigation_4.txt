valves, resulted in fuel inadvertently being fed into the right main tank and a gradually increasing fuel imbalance between the left and right main tanks. As the aircraft approached the departure runway, this abnormal fuel system behaviour triggered the FUEL CONFIG caution light, and the associated Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System advisory alert message.. Having considered the likelihood of a fuel leak and the low priority of the alert, the flight crew decided to address the imbalance once airborne. However, they did not consider the Minimum Equipment List procedural requirements to return to the line for maintenance action.. Two Other Factors that increased risk were also identified: The flight crew became aware of the abnormal operation of the fuel system shortly after the flight became airborne but delayed completion of the associated non-normal checklist. That resulted in a continued increase in the fuel imbalance to beyond the allowable limit, unnecessarily elevating the safety risk.. Contrary to the requirements of the operator's policy and procedures manual, the abnormal behaviour of the fuel system was not entered into the aircraft Technical Log as a defect. This resulted in a delay to maintenance corrective action until after a further two sectors had been flown by the aircraft and probably impacted on the difficulty in identifying the underlying fault.. Safety Action notified to the ATSB one month prior to the release of the Investigation Report as having been taken by Tasman Cargo Airlines was the drafting of an amendment to the 767 MEL to include clarification as to crew actions in the event of EICAS message between off blocks and take-off. When issued, it was stated that the amendment would be situated in the early part of the MEL Introduction section with a corresponding alert to flight crew. The Final Report was released on 22 April 2021. No Safety Recommendations were made.
