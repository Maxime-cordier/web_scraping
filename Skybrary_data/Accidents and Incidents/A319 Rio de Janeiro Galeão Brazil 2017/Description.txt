On 19 July 2017, an Airbus A319 (PR-AVC) being operated by Avianca Brazil on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from São Paulo Congonhas to Rio de Janeiro Galeão as Oceanair 6284 continued its non precision and unstabilised approach below MDA in day IMC without the required visual reference and after continued failure to achieve it did not initiate a go-around until it was 162 feet agl at which point an EGPWS Warning of terrain proximity was ignored in favour of a normal go around procedure. A second approach to a different runway was without further event and the 124 occupants were uninjured and the aircraft was undamaged.
