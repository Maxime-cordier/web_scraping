Administration should develop an Air Traffic Bulletin and provide a mandatory formal briefing to all air traffic controllers on the importance of and the need for giving air traffic information when issuing an anticipated separation and landing clearance. [A-91-27]. that the Federal Aviation Administration should amend the Air Traffic Control Handbook, 7110.65F paragraph 3-127, to preclude the issuance of multiple landing clearances to aircraft outside of the final approach fix. Also establish a numerical limit so that no more than two landing clearances may be issued to successive arrivals. [A-91-28]. that the Federal Aviation Administration should expedite efforts to fund the development and implementation of an operational system analogous to the airborne conflict alert system to alert controllers to pending runway incursions at all terminal facilities that are scheduled to receive Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE-3). [A-91-29]. that the Federal Aviation Administration should conduct research and development efforts to provide airports that are not scheduled to receive Airport Surface Detection Equipment with an alternate, cost effective, system to bring controller and pilot attention to pending runway incursions in time to prevent ground collisions. [A-91-30]. that the Federal Aviation Administration should incorporate into the training syllabus at the Federal Aviation Administration's Academy at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the importance of and the need for giving traffic information when issuing an anticipated separation landing clearance. Stress that this information will enhance pilot awareness and visual acquisition of preceding traffic, thereby providing a redundancy in separation assurance for controllers and pilots. [A-91-31]. The Final Report of the Investigation was adopted by the Board on 29 May 1991 and subsequently published.
