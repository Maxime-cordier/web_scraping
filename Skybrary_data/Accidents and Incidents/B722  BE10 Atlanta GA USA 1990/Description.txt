On 18 January 1990, a Boeing 727-200 (N8867E) being operated by Eastern Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from New York La Guardia to Atlanta as EA 111 collided with a Beechcraft King Air A100 (N44UE) being operated by Epps Air on a non-revenue air taxi positioning flight from DeKalb/Peachtree to Atlanta. Both aircraft had landed in sequence off ILS approaches to runway 26R at Atlanta in normal night visibility. There was no fire and although the collision caused substantial damage to the 727, none of its 157 occupants were injured. The King Air was destroyed by the impact. Its Pilot was killed and the other occupant, a Company Pilot not rated on type and present for type familiarisation purposes only, was seriously injured.
