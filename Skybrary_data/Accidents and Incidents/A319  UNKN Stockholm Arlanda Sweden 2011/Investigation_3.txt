view of data quality requirements, however Annex 14 which requires the survey of this position to a half-meter accuracy fails to specify the need to report it to the AIS, and Annex 15 does not provide any placeholder for its publication in the AIP template. Only Annex 4 (Aeronautical Charts) requires the indication of the markings of the holding position and stopbars in the AD chart, which is insufficient (and not followed as per example) for today's automated systems. These coordinates will be included in the future Airport Mapping Database (AMDB) applicable from 2015. However with AMDB being only a recommendation in SARPS, and having only the application to complex RWY/TWY structures, this issue will remain unsolved. (November 2012)
