On 19 December 2008, an Airbus A320-200 being operated by Aeroflot on a scheduled passenger flight from Moscow Sheremetyevo to Oslo descended at a high rate and airspeed significantly below its cleared altitude whilst attempting to establish on the Instrument Landing System (ILS) localiser for runway 19R at destination in night Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). An Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) ‘TERRAIN AHEAD’ activation resulted following which a recovery was made. There were no injuries to the 61 occupants during the excursion and the approach was subsequently discontinued in favour of vectoring to a second approach which was uneventful.
