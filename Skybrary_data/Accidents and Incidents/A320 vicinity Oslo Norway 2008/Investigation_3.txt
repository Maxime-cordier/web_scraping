stressed at a time when the focus should be directed at flying the aircraft” rather than making changes in the aircraft systems such as those required to change the active landing runway in the AFGS. It was concluded that “a risk of controlled flight into terrain (Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT)) was present but not imminent” on the basis that “when at its lowest altitude of 2540 feet, it would have required approximately one minute of level flight before (the aircraft) would (have been) in conflict with rising terrain ahead”. It was noted that “although the recovery was late and slow, once initiated it was positive to the point where the First Officer elected not to intervene more aggressively”. It was noted that whilst it is desirable for ATC to embrace flexibility to achieve efficient traffic processing, this must not be at the expense of safety given that “there is a point where flexible and efficient traffic processing reaches a limit which may threaten safety”. It was considered too that “established work methodology should not be deviated from, for example changing the landing runway when the aircraft is less than 30 nm out should not happen unless the crew (are willing to) accept the change". However, it was accepted that “regardless of factors that could have been changed by air traffic control, the commander has the overall responsibility for safe flying”. The Investigation considered that “in this incident both ATC and the crew had time to solve the misunderstandings prior to (the incident aircraft) approaching the localiser” and concluded that “it is both parties responsibility to ensure precise communication”. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 11 June 2013 and made available in English translation. No Safety Recommendations were made.
