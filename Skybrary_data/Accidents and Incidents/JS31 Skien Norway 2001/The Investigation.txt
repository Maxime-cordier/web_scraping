"Information from the FDR and CVR indicates that the aircraft maintained an indicated speed of approx. 110 - 115 kts when the aircraft encountered an abnormally high sink rate and hit the runway. Both of the crew members thought that they were a little high on final approach because the white light (PLASI 3.30L) flashed a few times. According to the Commander, the aircraft developed a high rate of descend in flare at the same time as the Power Levers were pulled back to Flight Idle 2.5 - 3 seconds before landing. According to the passengers, the landing was especially hard, and several thought that the aircraft fell the last metres down onto the runway. The breath was knocked out of one passenger momentarily when the aircraft hit the ground. According to a printout from the FDR, the load was 6 g at the moment of landing. […] The investigation shows that it is probable that ice on the wings was the initiating factor for the accident. The AIBN has not formed an opinion on whether the ice resulted in the high sink rate after the first officer reduced the power output of the engines, or whether the aircraft stalled before it hit the runway. Investigation has to a large extend focused on the crew composition and training. A systematic investigation of the organisation has also taken place. In the opinion of the AIBN, the company has principally based its operations on minimum standards, and this has resulted in a number of weaknesses in organisation, procedures and quality assurance. These conditions have indirectly led to the company operating the route Skien - Bergen with a crew that, at times, did not maintain the standard that is expected for scheduled passenger flights. The investigation has also revealed that procedures for de-icing of the aircraft wings could be improved…"
