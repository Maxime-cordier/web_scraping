The Report identifies the following factors (Significant Investigation Results) that led to the accident: "The decision was made to wait to remove the ice from the wings because, according to the SOPs, it should only be removed if it had been “typically half an inch on the leading edge”. This postponement was a contributory factor in the ice being forgotten.. At times, the relationship between the flight crew members was very tense during the approach to Skien. This led to a breakdown in crew coordination.. Among the consequences of the warnings from the GPWS was a very high workload for the crew. In combination with the defective crew coordination, this contributed to the ice on the wings being forgotten.. It is probable that the aircraft hit the runway with great force because the wings were contaminated with ice. The AIBN is not forming a final opinion on whether the wings stalled, whether the aircraft developed a high sink rate due to ice accretion or whether the hard landing was due to a combination of the two explanatory models.. The company could only provide documentary evidence to show that the Commander had attended an absolute minimum of training after being employed within the company. Parts of the mandatory training had taken place by means of self-study without any form of formal verification of achievement of results.. The company’s operation was largely based on minimum solutions. This reduced the safety margins within company operations.. The company’s quality system contributed little to ensuring ‘Safe Operational Practices’ in the company.. Authority inspection of the company was deficient..
