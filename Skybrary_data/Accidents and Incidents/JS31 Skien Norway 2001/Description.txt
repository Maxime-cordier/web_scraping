On 30 November 2001, a BAe Jetstream 31 operated by European Executive Express ran off the side of runway 19 on landing at Skien Airport, Geiteryggen, Norway. The runway excursion was the consequence of an unstable non-precision approach, with airframe ice accretion, and a very heavy touchdown, which caused severe aircraft damage and loss of control.
