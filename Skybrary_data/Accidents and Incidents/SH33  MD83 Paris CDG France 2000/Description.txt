On the 25rd of May, 2000 a Shorts SD330 (G-SSWN) being operated by Streamline Aviation on a scheduled cargo flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle to London Luton as 'Streamline 200' and about to depart was involved in normal night visibility in a high speed collision on runway 27 with an MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MD-83 (F-GHED) being operated by Air Liberté which was departing Paris on a passenger charter flight to Madrid as 'Liberté 8807'. Both aircraft sustained significant damage but there was no post-impact fire. The casualties were the two pilots of the SD330, one of whom was killed and the other seriously injured as a direct result of the impact of MD83’s left wing with the SD330 flight deck.
