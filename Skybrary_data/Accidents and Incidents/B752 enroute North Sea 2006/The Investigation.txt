"The blue haze could not be reproduced on initial investigation, which included engine ground runs. A planned post-maintenance proving flight was aborted during the takeoff roll when smoke entered the flight deck and cabin. Further investigation, which included ground runs at higher engine power settings, identified the source of the smoke to be the No 2 (right) engine. The cause was determined to be a fractured No 1 bearing floating seal ring, which had allowed engine oil to leak into the compressor airflow path and to be ingested into the bleed air system, which provides air to the cabin air conditioning system.". Two Safety Recommendations are made. "It is recommended that the Boeing Commercial Airplane Company consider revising the procedures in the Boeing 757 Fault Isolation Manual to introduce a requirement for ground running at higher engine power settings, if initial testing fails to identify the source of smoke or fumes in conditioned air.. It is recommended that the European Aviation Safety Agency ensure that effective measures are in place for cabin crews to become, and remain familiar with, the different opening procedures and characteristics of aircraft exits in both normal and emergency modes of operation.".
