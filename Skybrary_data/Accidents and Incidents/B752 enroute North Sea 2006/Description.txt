On 22 October 2006 a blue haze was observed in the passenger cabin of a Boeing 757-200 being operated by Thomsonfly shortly after it reached cruise altitude on a scheduled passenger flight from Newcastle to Larnaca. A precautionary diversion was made to London Stansted, where an emergency evacuation was carried out successfully.
