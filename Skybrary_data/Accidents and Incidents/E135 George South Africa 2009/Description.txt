On 7 December 2009, an Embraer 135 being operated by South African Airlink on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Cape Town to George was unable to stop on the wet runway at destination after touchdown in normal day visibility and overran beyond the aerodrome perimeter before coming to rest on public road. The aircraft was substantially damaged but there was no fire and all 34 occupants were able to evacuate the aircraft, 10 with minor injuries.
