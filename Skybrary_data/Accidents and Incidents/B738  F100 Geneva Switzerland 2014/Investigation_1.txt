An Investigation was carried out by the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board (STSB). Recorded ATC data relevant to the Investigation were recovered and were sufficient to inform the Investigation without recourse to the FDR from either of the aircraft directly involved. The CVR data relevant to the Investigation had been overwritten on both these aircraft. The prevailing weather conditions were good and had no bearing on the investigated conflict. The runway and its approach are situated within the Class 'D' airspace of the Geneva Control Zone. It was noted that the 737 crew consisted of a Captain with Greek nationality born in 1961 with 18,750 hours total flying experience which included 9,100 hours on type and a Co-pilot of Turkish nationality born in 1971 with 4,910 total flying hours which included 1,450 hours on type. The F100 crew were both Austrian nationals; the Captain was born in 1975 and had 7,794 total flying hours including 1,131 hours on type and the Co-pilot was born in 1980 and had 6,000 total flying hours including 2,300 hours on type. The Controller responsible for the runway was a Swiss national born in 1975 and the TWR Supervisor was a Swiss national born in 1971. It was established that the TWR controller had instructed the Fokker 100 to line up and wait at the beginning of 3,900 metre-long runway 05 following the departure of a Falcon 7X and then asked the Boeing 737-800 on visual final approach to the same runway (LDA 3570 metres) and at 9.8 nm from its displaced threshold to reduce speed to 160 KIAS. Noticing that a PC12 awaiting departure from the north side of the runway at the taxiway 'Z' intersection was in the same (Light) wake vortex separation category as the Falcon 7X, they had instructed it (in French) to also line up and wait and then informed the F100 that it would now be No. 2 to depart. As the PC12 entered the runway and was cleared to take off (in French), the 737 was at 6nm. At this point, the controller reported realising that the delay in giving take off clearance to the F100 would compromise the minimum separation (2,000 metres) between it and the approaching 737 - by now at 5nm - at the point when the F100 could be expected to get airborne. They reacted by giving the F100 an initial altitude of 4,000 feet and then instructed the 737 to further reduce its airspeed from 160 KIAS to the minimum possible. Once the PC12 became airborne, it was instructed (in French) to "climb at best rate" until passing 5,000 feet QNH. Thirty seconds later, with the 737 at 2.2 nm and at 147KIAS, the PC 12 was instructed (in French) to turn left and take-off clearance was issued to the F100. Twenty three seconds later, the RIMCAS safety net "indicated a potentially dangerous convergence on the runway" by illuminating the radar labels of the 737 and the F100 in amber on the screens
