the fact that a limit had been exceeded".. The Investigation determined that the Cause of the investigated Serious Incident was "the dangerous convergence of an aircraft on take-off and an aircraft in (the) landing phase (both) on concrete runway 05 because of the inappropriate integration of a take-off from (the) intersection (at) taxiway 'Z'". A Contributory Factor was also identified: the parameterisation of the RIMCAS system (Runway Incursion Monitoring and Conflict Alert Sub-system).. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) should ensure that the parameterisation of the RIMCAS system (Runway Incursion Monitoring and Conflict Alert Sub-system) is reviewed so that the safety net is effective for weather conditions other than those of low visibility.. The Final Report was approved on 1 December 2016 and published on 5 December 2016. ICAO AIRPROX Category 'A' was assigned.
