(thereby) upset leading to a nose-down pitch moment.. Insufficient Situational Awareness. The pilots at the controls did not recognise the AP disengagement and pitch trim status through the flight control response or the Flight Control Synoptic display in a timely manner. Vital time was lost in comprehending the situation which resulted in an excessive rate of descent.. Ineffective Crew Resource Management. Necessary recovery actions by the pilots were hindered due to ineffective CRM, which consequentially escalated the height loss situation.. Two Safety Recommendations were made at the conclusion of the Investigation as follows: that Hanergy Jet should review and strengthen flight crew training on situational awareness, monitoring of aircraft status with particular emphasis on the AP and pitch trim systems, their effects on flight control, and avoidance of inadvertent input to any aircraft systems. [2017-1]. that Hanergy Jet should review and enhance its CRM training to ensure more effective communications and coordination in the flight deck for the handling of abnormal situations. [2017-2]. The Final Report was published on 21 June 2017.
