It was noted that whilst the Investigation was in progress, the Airport Authority had Amended the Aerodrome Manual of Air Traffic Services to state that “In order to minimise the impact of bird activity on aircraft operations, the Duty ATCO shall initiate a bird patrol prior to the arrival or departure of scheduled or jet traffic”.. By means of a Safety Bulletin reminder all staff of their responsibilities in respect of bird strike risk management.. The first action above was specifically endorsed by the Investigation and “accordingly, the Investigation considers that there is no requirement for a further Safety Recommendation in this respect”. The Final Report: AAIU Report No: 2011-002 of the Investigation was published on 24 January 2011.
