On 15 September 2006, an Easyjet Airbus AIRBUS A-319, despatched under Minimum Equipment List (MEL) provision with one engine generator inoperative and the corresponding electrical power supplied by the APU generator, suffered a further en route electrical failure which included power loss to all COM radio equipment which could not then be re-instated. The flight was completed as flight planned using the remaining flight instruments with the one remaining transponder selected to the standard emergency code. The incident began near Nantes, France.
