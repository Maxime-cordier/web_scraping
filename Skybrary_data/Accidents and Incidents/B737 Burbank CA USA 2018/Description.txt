On 6 December 2018, a Boeing 737-700 (N752SW) being operated by Southwest Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Oakland to Burbank as SWA 278 overran the 1,770 metre-long landing runway 08 at destination by 45 metres after entering the engineered material arresting system (EMAS) and decelerating rapidly. Normal visibility prevailed but heavy rain began falling shortly before landing and touchdown occurred well past the point assumed by the non-current weather data obtained at the top of descent which was not subsequently reviewed. Damage to the aircraft was categorised as minor and there were no injuries to the 117 occupants who evacuated onto the EMAS surface using the airstairs.
