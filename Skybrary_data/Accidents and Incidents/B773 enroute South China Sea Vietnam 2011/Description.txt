On 17 October 2011, a Boeing 777-300 being operated by Singapore Airlines on a passenger flight from Shanghai to Singapore with line training in progress and a Safety Pilot present on the flight deck encountered a very brief period of unexpectedly severe turbulence whilst in the cruise at FL350 in night Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) and a small loss of altitude resulted. Sixteen unsecured passengers and five members of the cabin crew sustained mainly minor injuries but after assessment, it was determined that the flight to destination should be completed as planned and this was accomplished without further event.
