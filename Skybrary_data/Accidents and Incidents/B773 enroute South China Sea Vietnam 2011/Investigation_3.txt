Actions taken by the Operator, all aimed at improving the understanding of pilots of both weather avoidance and the correct use of both types of weather radar fitted to the 777 fleet were noted. One further “Safety Suggestion” was made as a result of the Investigation that Operator should consider replacing older ‘RDR 4B’ weather radar systems with the fully automated ‘RDR 4000’ model. However, the response of the Operator was that the older systems were no less effective in differentiating weather severity provided that they were used as intended and that pilot recurrent training to this end had been strengthened since the event investigated. The Final Report was published on 14 May 2013.
