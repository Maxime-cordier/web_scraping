The following is an extract from the synopsis of the Accident Report published by the Spanish CAIAIC: "During the takeoff…from Amsterdam to Barcelona, the aircraft suffered a bird strike in the area of the nose landing gear during rotation. The crew informed ATC and the flight continued without any abnormal indication in the cockpit. During the landing roll at Barcelone, when the nose wheels touched down, the aircraft started deviating to the left of runway 25R. The flight crew applied right rudder, brakes and used the nose wheel steering tiller but could not avoid that the aircraft went off the runway through the unprepared terrain located to the left of runway 25R. The aircraft suffered major damage during that run until it eventually came to a stop close to a wide rain drainage canal located 107m from the runway axis. An emergency evacuation was carried out in which 5 passengers suffered minor injuries. There was no fire. The investigation determined that the accident probably happened because during the takeoff a bird strike broke one of the cables of the nosewheel steering system of the aircraft, which made that the nose wheels were rotated to the left when they touched down during landing, causing a veering to the left that could not be arrested by full rudder deflection as the aircraft decelerated. The subsequent application of brakes and other actions by the crew could not avoid that the aircraft went outside the runway surface. …Contributing to the breaking of the cable was the fact that the cable was severely worn locally. The wear could be traced back to the incorrect application of grease to the cable system during maintenance…."
