On 19 March 2007, shortly after a night take off from Stansted UK and in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), the crew of a Lockheed Electra Freighter being operated by Atlantic Airways experienced control difficulties because of power fluctuation on all engines which were subsequently attributed to a malfunctioning propeller synchrophaser. The flight crew were unclear at the time what was occurring and proceeded to shut down one engine and believed that the others were at risk of failure during a return to land.
