This is an extract from the report published by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Branch (UK) (AAIB), UK: "Immediately after takeoff on a night flight from Stansted to Edinburgh, the flight crew experienced control difficulties and fluctuation of the rpm and power on all four engines. As the aircraft climbed towards 3,000 ft above mean sea level (QNH) the No 2 engine was observed to be running down. The crew shut the engine down, declared a PAN and prepared to return to Stansted. The remaining three engines continued to suffer from fluctuating parameters throughout the rest of the flight until, when on final approach with landing flap selected, both the No 1 and No 3 engines appeared to run down. The aircraft landed using only the No 4 engine. The investigation revealed that the incident was the result of a failure of the propeller synchrophaser."
