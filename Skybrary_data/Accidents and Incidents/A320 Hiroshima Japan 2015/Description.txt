On 14 April 2015, an Airbus A320 (HL7762) being operated by Asiana Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Incheon, South Korea to Hiroshima as OZ 162 touched down before the beginning of the runway after making a night non precision approach which had been conducted in visibility conditions which had rapidly deteriorated from VMC to IMC. About half way down the runway, it veered off to the left before eventually stopping. An emergency evacuation was conducted and minor injuries were sustained by two of the cabin crew and 26 of the 74 passengers. The aircraft and ground lighting and an antenna located in the undershoot area sustained substantial impact damage.
