On 9 June 2021, an Airbus A320 (G-EUUO) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from London Heathrow to Manchester as BA1386 made a high speed rejected takeoff on runway 27R in normal day visibility because of a significant difference in the two pilotsâ€™ primary airspeed indications. After coming to a stop with plenty of runway ahead, the aircraft was taxied back to the terminal.
