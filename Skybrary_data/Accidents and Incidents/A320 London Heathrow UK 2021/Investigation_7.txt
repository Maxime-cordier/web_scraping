emerging in the spring of 2022. Therefore, even though traffic levels and aircraft utilisation are expected to increase in 2022, the seasonal risk of insects blocking pitot probes could be significant. Proactive habitat management and aircraft monitoring will be required to mitigate the risk. With the move towards ‘greener’ aviation, this may become even more important in the future. Safety Action taken during the Investigation as a result of its findings was as follows: The UK CAA issued a Safety Notice on ‘Pitot Blockage Events’. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways: for the duration of the identified problem, the requirement for fitting pitot mast covers to parked aircraft was enhanced and DVIs of pitot masts for blockages were required as part of initial pre flight external inspections on all aircraft which had previously been parked away from the terminal gates at Heathrow.. Heathrow Airport decided to update its environmental hazard management plan to take the findings of the Investigation into account.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 27 January 2022. No Safety Recommendations were made but it was noted that although the Investigation had been confined to Heathrow Airport and its surrounds, in view of the environmental factors which had emerged during it, some of the findings may also have potential relevance at other aerodromes at certain times of the year.
