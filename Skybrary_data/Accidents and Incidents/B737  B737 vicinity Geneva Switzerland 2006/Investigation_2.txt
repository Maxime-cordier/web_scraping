"did not specify that it was to do this in the form of a visual climb despite the configuration of the terrain towards which the aircraft was heading". Avoiding action give by TWR to the BBJ on go around "to climb at a high rate" did not remove the restriction of 4000 feet which was part of the missed approach procedure being followed despite the fact that "there was no VFR transit traffic above the CTR" (and so) an altitude of 7000 ft could therefore have been assigned to it directly, in coordination with Approach Control".. The Investigation "noted that the go-around procedure as designed compromises flight safety in the case of a simultaneous take-off by an aircraft from runway 05". The Cause of the Serious Incident was formally determined as "the fact that ATC cleared an aircraft to line up and then to take off whilst an aircraft on final approach was making an unstabilised visual approach, the outcome of which would clearly be a go-around. It was also noted that Contributory Factors had been: a lack of cooperation within the flight crew of the (Privat Air) aircraft. a lack of cooperation between ATC APP and TWR. inadequate avoiding action issued by ATC. The Final Report of the Investigation was completed on 26 February 2008. No Safety Recommendations were made.
