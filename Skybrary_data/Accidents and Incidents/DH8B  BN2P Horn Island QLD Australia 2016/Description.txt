On 12 October 2016, a Pilatus Britten-Norman BN2-A Islander (VH-IOA) being operated by Cape Air Transport on a passenger charter flight from Kubin to Horn Island had to discontinue its approach just before touchdown in day VMC when a Bombardier DHC8-200 (VH-ZZJ) being operated by Cobham Air Services on an aerial survey flight commenced its take-off from an intersecting runway. The two aircraft were in close proximity as the DHC8 made its initial climb close to the BN2 which had turned left to avoid the extended centreline of the runway from which the DHC8 was departing.
