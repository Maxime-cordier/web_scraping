approach during the training.. Arrange and conduct research of spatial disorientation and upset conditions and develop practical safety measures. Based on the research results, develop and implement a special flight crew training course (similar to Upset Recovery Training) that would contain theory and practice.. Consider the practicability of using aircraft with western type attitude indicators at colleges of initial flight training. While Russian training aircraft of such type would be designed, consider the practicability of acquiring western aircraft suitable for initial training. As an alternative measure, consider installing western type attitude indicators on the already used Russian training aircraft.. Ensure continuous MEL usage monitoring. Avoid flights with extended MEL items without a detailed analysis of any particular case.. Together with the equipment manufacturer consider the practicability of replacing the artificial voice warning "Bank angle" by a similar phrase which would indicate the direction of bank (left/right).

Notes of the SKYbrary editor: * ”simple meteorological conditions” are used as a term in the Final report B 737-505 VP-BKO. Further clarification in the report regarding this term is made: “According to the Russian regulations meteorological conditions (at an airport) not worse than 2000 m visibility and 200 m ceiling are considered to be simple ones.” * throttle stagger - throttle stagger is the term which is used to describe the existence of a difference in the relative position of thrust / power levers when equal thrust or power is set on all engines.
