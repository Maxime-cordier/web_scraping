On 9 April 2017, an ATR 72-500 (ZK-MCY) being operated by Mount Cook Airline on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Auckland to Nelson was unable to obtain a right main landing gear locked-down status indication on approach to Nelson in day VMC and after declaring a ‘PAN’ diverted to the longer runway at Palmerston North where despite the same unsafe indication for the right gear, it did not collapse and the aircraft was stopped on the runway for disembarkation.
