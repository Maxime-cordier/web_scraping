and had the potential to exacerbate the condition.. Safety Action taken as a result of the event and whilst the TAIC Investigation was in progress were noted as having included the following: Mount Cook Airline replaced all landing gear locking springs which had accumulated 30,000 or more cycles and introduced a limit on the service life of these springs to the first nine years or 20,000 cycles since installed new. They also introduced a new cleaning and lubrication task for the springs as part of each 500-hour maintenance check.. ATR updated the aircraft CMM to add a new inspection tasks for the springs at overhaul in order to prevent reoccurrence.. The Key Lessons arising from the Investigation were recorded as: The importance of a pre-flight visual inspection of critical components such as those of the landing gear, particularly when the integrity of the components relies on pre-flight visual inspections.. Although on this occasion re-cycling the faulty landing gear did not have any adverse outcome, this action was not in accordance with flight crew operating manual procedures. In other failure cases, recycling can exacerbate the extent of the problem.. Aircraft recorders provide a valuable source of information for an investigation. Operators should enforce strict adherence to post-accident and incident procedures for preserving the data on any on-board record.. The Final Report was approved for publication by the Commission on 16 October 2019 the published on 5 December 2019. No Safety Recommendations were made.
