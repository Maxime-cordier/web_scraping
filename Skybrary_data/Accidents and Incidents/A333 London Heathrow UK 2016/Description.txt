On 26 June 2016, dense smoke suddenly appeared prior to a daylight engine start in the cabin of a fully boarded Airbus A330-300 (N276AY) being operated by American Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight about to depart from stand 307 at London Heathrow. An emergency evacuation was commenced on the initiative of the cabin crew but was subsequently limited to exit via the still-attached airbridge. 277 passengers left the aircraft, the majority onto the airbridge and the smoke had almost disappeared by the time the last passengers left the aircraft. There was one recorded minor injury as a result of the evacuation during which slides were deployed at three exits and used at two of these.
