confirmed the activation of the left engine reverser and also called the non-deployment of the ground spoilers. The failure of the ground spoilers to deploy was recorded on the FDR as was the non-activation of the armed autobrakes, which it was noted was a direct consequence of the absence of ground spoiler deployment which alone would have reduced aircraft braking performance by almost 50%. In response to the failure to decelerate, both pilots applied and held maximum manual brake pressure but the rate of deceleration did not improve and was still recorded as almost 100 knots at the final impact of the aircraft with the building below the end of the runway. Downloaded FDR data did not provide any evidence that aquaplaning had occurred although the Investigation considered that there was “a high probability that the pilots were led to believe that the lack of the expected deceleration after landing was a result of… the wet runway” even though it was apparent that they were aware almost immediately that the ground spoilers had not deployed. Since the ‘RETARD’ auto callout had sounded after the left hand thrust lever was moved to the flight idle position during the flare to land (because the A/T was still engaged and the right hand thrust lever was in the CL position), it was considered that there was a ‘high probability’ that during the landing, the aircraft commander had “inadvertently” left the right hand thrust lever in the CL position whilst placing the left hand thrust lever initially at flight idle and then into reverse. It was calculated that landing with an inoperative reverser on a wet runway with one thrust lever in ‘REV’ and the other in ‘CL’ even without considering the thrust provided by the No 2 engine, in excess of 2000 metres would have been necessary for the aircraft to come to a complete stop, In effect, once the aircraft had touched down with no ground spoiler deployment on such a relatively short runway, the excursion off the runway at speed rapidly became inevitable. Having concluded that the lack of deceleration which led to the overrun had been a consequence of the pilots’ failure to notice that the right engine thrust lever was in the ‘CLIMB’ detent, it was also found that: The broader context for the accident was the consequences of the rapid growth of the Operator, TAM, which had “accentuated the effects of the lack of coordination among its diverse sectors, hindering the oversight at all management levels”.. Because the A320 Service Bulletin (SB) which brought the Flight Warning Computer (FWC) up to the ‘H2F3’ production standard for new aircraft by introducing an ‘ENG X THR LEVER ABV IDLE’ message on the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) if either thrust lever was above ‘IDLE’ during the landing roll was not made mandatory by the Regulator, TAM were not required to adopt it and they did not do so voluntarily..
