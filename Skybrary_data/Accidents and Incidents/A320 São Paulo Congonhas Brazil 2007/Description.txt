On 17 July 2007, an Airbus A320 (PR-MBK) being operated by TAM Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight (JJ3054) from Porto Alegre to SÃ£o Paulo Congonhas and making a night landing in normal ground visibility failed to decelerate normally after touchdown on runway 35L and departed the side of the paved surface near its end and became briefly airborne from the elevated terrain before crashing into a building beyond the airport perimeter. Both the building and the aircraft were destroyed by the impact and a fierce fire which followed and all 187 occupants and 12 people on the ground were killed.
