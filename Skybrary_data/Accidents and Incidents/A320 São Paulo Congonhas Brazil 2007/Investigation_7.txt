and the actions to be taken in case of non-functioning of the ground spoilers and/or brakes. Such analysis has the objective of defining the immediate start of any go-around which may become necessary. (A) 144 / A / 07. that ANAC should study the viability of setting norms for RBHA 121 operators to include in the procedure following touchdown confirmation of the functioning of the ground spoilers before the activation of the thrust reverser. This sequence has the objective of allowing a touch-and-go landing, in case of non-functioning of the ground spoilers. (A) 145 / A / 07. that ANAC should establish procedures for RBHA 121 operators to carry out training of touch-and-go landings after the malfunction of ground spoilers and/or brakes in flight simulators with the objective of demonstrating the characteristics of the aircraft performance under those conditions. (A) 146 / A / 07. that ANAC should update the pertinent documentation so as to officially document the procedures recommended in Safety Recommendations (A) 144 / A / 07, 145 / A / 07 and 146 / A / 07. (A) 147 / A / 07. that ANAC should evaluate the practicality of establishing deactivated thrust-reverser landing training for RBHA 121 operators with the objective of implementing such training. (A) 148 / A / 07. that ANAC should study the need to establish parameters for fuel tankering by RBHA 121 operators when proceeding to land in limiting conditions in relation to the landing envelope. (A) 149 / A / 07. Issued on 18 December 2007: that INFRAERO should make provisions for the repositioning and/or calibration of the level of illumination of the parking ramp reflectors at the new passenger terminal at Congonhas Airport so as to prevent the dazzling of pilots during the landing and takeoff operations at the main runway (17R / 35L). [(A) 153 / A / 07]. that INFRAERO should reformulate the procedures utilised in the processing of Prevention Reports (RELPREV) so as to prioritise their quick receipt by Local Airport Administrations, their immediate analysis and review and the prompt implementation of any pertinent preventative actions. (A) 154 / A / 07. that INFRAERO should implement procedures which establish the active participation of the AAL in the oversight of works executed in their airports, aiming at guaranteeing full appreciation of the physical modifications being made and their compatibility with operational practices. (A) 155 / A / 07. that CENIPA should publish to the Brazilian aeronautical community, in the form of an Operational Publication and other existing means of communication, the content of these Safety Recommendations, in order to maintain a high level of perception and situational awareness. (A) 156 / A / 07. Issued on 28 December 2007: that ANAC should study, in coordination with the certification organisations of other countries and with aircraft manufacturers, whether there is a need to establish procedures for aircraft certified under RBHA 25 which define corrective action when the ground spoilers do not deploy after touchdown.
