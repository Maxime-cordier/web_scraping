/ A / 07. that ANAC should maintain effective control of the execution by the Airport Administration of the friction and surface texture measurement tests concerning the pavements of the 17R/35L (main) and 17L/35R (auxiliary) runways of the Congonhas Airport after the construction, resurfacing, maintenance or periodic inspection of the runways, in accordance with the IAC 4302, dated 28 May 2001. (A) 48 / A / 07. that ANAC should establish parameters and procedures so as to guarantee the safety of air operations on the 17L/35R (auxiliary) runway of Congonhas Airport in the event of rain. (A) 49 / A / 07. that ANAC should make provisions for the evaluation of the performance of large size jet aircraft (more than 60,000 pounds), which operate or are expected to use the Congonhas Airport runway system, based on demonstrations of real operations with special landing techniques on wet runways, according to the method prescribed in the IAC 3502-121 0888, establishing the operational flight parameters and procedures, as well as the infrastructure, to guarantee the safety of the landing and take-off operations at the airport. (A) 50 / A / 07. that ANAC should inform the various companies operating at Congonhas Airport that, for purposes of planning the air operations on the 17R/35L (main) and 17L/35R (auxiliary) runways, their respective Operation Managements, based on information published by the INFRAERO by means of NOTAM, on the friction and surface texture requirements in accordance with the IAC 4302, dated 28 May 2001, must carry out runway analysis for their various types of equipment in order to adjust to the existing conditions of the aforementioned runways. (A) 51 / A / 07. that ANAC should monitor the action taken to record progressive changes in the friction and surface macro-texture parameters of the Congonhas Airport main runway by the airport administration, so as to have technical data and information capable of facilitating and expediting the evaluation of the special maintenance plan to be proposed by the airport administration. (A) 52 / A / 07. that ANAC should determine the establishment of a Runway End Safety Area (RESA), in accordance with the technical standards set by the ICAO Annex 14, as one of the priority infrastructure improvements to be established for Congonhas Airport, adjusting the other components of the runway system to the operational safety requirements of the runways and thus guaranteeing the safety of landing and takeoff operations as recommended in (A) 50 / A/ 07, even though it may imply the shortening of the current length of the main and auxiliary runways. (A) 53 / A / 07. that AAL Congonhas should monitor the surface characteristics of the 17R/35L (main) and 17L/35R (auxiliary) runways of Congonhas Airport in accordance with the IAC 4302, dated 28 May 2001 and promptly implement the appropriate corrective actions for the restoration of required safety standards whenever the levels of surface friction or surface texture are below the prescribed minimums, immediately informing pilots by means of a NOTAM of the conditions
