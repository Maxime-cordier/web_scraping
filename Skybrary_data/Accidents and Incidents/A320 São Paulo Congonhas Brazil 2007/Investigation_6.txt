of the aforementioned runways. (A) 54 / A / 07. that AAL Congonhas should forward to ANAC the results of the measurement of friction and surface texture tests of the pavements of the 17R/35L (main) and 17L/35R (auxiliary) runways of Congonhas Airport after any construction, resurfacing, maintenance or periodic inspection as established by IAC 4302, dated 28 May 2001. (A) 55 / A / 07. that AAL Congonhas should take measurements of the friction coefficient and surface macrotexture of the 17R/35L (main) runway of Congonhas Airport taking account of the cutting of grooves and forward the results to the ANAC, as prescribed in the IAC 4302, dated 28 May 2001. (A) 56 / A / 07. that AAL Congonhas should take measurements of the friction coefficient and surface macrotexture of the 17R/35L (main) runway of Congonhas Airport, at least every fortnight so as to track changes of those parameters resulting from rubber build-up caused by landing and takeoff operations on the 17R/35L (main) runway. (A) 57 / A / 07. that AAL Congonhas should submit, for the approval by the ANAC, a special plan of maintenance of the 17R/35L (main) runway of Congonhas Airport based on results obtained through the procedure determined in Safety Recommendation (A) 57 / A / 07. (A) 58 / A / 07. that Airline Companies operating at Congonhas should adjust the performance of their aircraft for operations at Congonhas Airport by considering the possibility of using the 17L/35R (auxiliary) runway for landings and takeoffs in rainy weather. (A) 59 / A / 07. that TAM Airlines should emphasise the strict adherence of the technical crews to the MEL of the A319, A320 and A321 equipment, relative to the item 78-30 – OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES – EXHAUST – THRUST REVERSER, which deals with the operation of the aircraft with a thrust reverser locked-out. (A) 60 / A / 07. that CENIPA should publish to the Brazilian aeronautical community, in the form of an Operational Publication and other existing means of communication, the content of these Safety Recommendations in order to maintain a high level of perception and situational awareness. (A) 61 / A / 07. that CENIPA should carry out a Special Flight-Safety Inspection of the TAM Airlines Company, in accordance with the NSCA 3-3, item 6.2.2. (A) 62 / A / 07. that CENIPA should carry out a Special Flight-Safety Inspection of the INFRAERO AAL at Congonhas in accordance with the NSCA 3-3, item 6.2.2. (A) 63 / A / 07. Issued on 2 October 2007: that Airlines operating under RBHA 121 should study the practicability of adjusting the operation of their aircraft at airports defined by them as “airports operation under special condition” and examine the possibility of not permitting landings and takeoffs by aircraft with locked out thrust reversers. (A) 143 / A / 07. Issued on 21 November 2007: that ANAC should set procedures for RBHA 121 operators to include in the descent briefing an analysis of the runway length necessary for landing
