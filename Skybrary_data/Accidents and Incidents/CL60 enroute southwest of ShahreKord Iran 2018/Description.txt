On 11 March 2018 a Bombardier 604 Challenger (TC-TRB) being operated by MC Aviation on a private passenger flight from Sharjah to Istanbul Ataturk experienced an indicated airspeed discrepancy whilst adjusting the cruise level from FL360 to FL 380 in day IMC following which control was lost as a series of stall warnings was followed by the flameout of both engines. Recovery was not attempted and impact with mountainous terrain followed soon afterwards. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire and the three crew and eight passengers on board were killed.
