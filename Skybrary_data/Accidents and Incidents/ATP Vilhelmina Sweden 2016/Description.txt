On 6 April 2016, a BAe ATP (SE-LLO) being operated by NextJet on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Hemavan TÃ¤rnaby to Vilhelmina as 2N773H partly left the runway to one side in normal day visibility when reverse pitch was selected after touchdown following an ILS approach. The runway was regained and the aircraft taxied in to the gate. Resultant damage to a runway edge light was found but damage to the aircraft trailing edge flaps was not and it subsequently continued flying, during which period neither the next four flight crew pre flight external checks nor a routine engineering inspection prior to those flights detected the damage; it was only finally noticed after these flights had been completed and the aircraft immediately grounded for repairs.
