from runway 24, and was confronted with a potential conflict when the crew of the landing aircraft on runway 18C announced their go-around. Runway 24 and 18C are converging runways. Attempts to cause the aircraft to abort its takeoff failed, resulting in a potential hazardous situation. Thanks to the almost simultaneous intervention by the runway controller and the response from the two crews, no actual collision hazard occurred. Allowing reduced separation during the use of dependent takeoff and landing runways is a procedure which can result in the occurrence of undesirable and potentially hazardous situations. Aside from the uncertainty about the legitimacy of this procedure, the question is whether the advantage gained - namely increased capacity - outweighs the potential hazard that can arise. With that in mind, LVNL (the ANSP) should maintain the basic rule that takeoff clearance will only be issued after the landing on the dependent runway has actually been confirmed by the runway controller or if the landing aircraft is still at least 2 NM from the runway threshold. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Air Traffic Control the Netherlands (LVNL) remove the procedure “Reduced separation between takeoff and landing traffic” from the Operations Manual and adhere to the standard procedure for using dependent runways.. That the Minister of Infrastructure and Water Management has Air Traffic Control the Netherlands’ (LVNL) procedures regarding the use of dependent runways assessed against current legislation and regulations.. The Final Report was published on 24 September 2020.
