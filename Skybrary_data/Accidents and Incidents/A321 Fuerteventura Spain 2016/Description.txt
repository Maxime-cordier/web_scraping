On 16 July 2016, an Airbus A321 (D-ASTP) being operated by Germania on a scheduled passenger flight from Dusseldorf to Fuerteventura as GMI 3700 made a go around from the runway after a mishandled initial touchdown at destination following an approach in day VMC. The subsequent landing was successful but the aircraft was later found to have made its return flight to Dusseldorf in an unsafe condition due to serious damage caused during the initial abandoned landing attempt and on arrival was grounded for replacement of parts of both main landing gear assemblies.
