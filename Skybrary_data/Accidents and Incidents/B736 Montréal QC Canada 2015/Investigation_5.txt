aircraft is not on the ground, then there is a risk that the landing will result in a runway overrun.. If crews are not provided with clear clues to indicate how far from the end of a runway they are, then there is a risk that deceleration devices will not be used in a timely manner to prevent a runway overrun.. If pilots limit the use of deceleration devices to comply with a real or perceived requirement to expedite exiting at the end of the runway, then there is a risk that the landing will result in a runway overrun.. If Code 4 runways do not have a 300 metre Runway End Safety Area or a means of stopping aircraft that provides an equivalent level of safety, then there is a risk of injuries to occupants in the event of a runway overrun.. Two Other Findings were also formally documented as follows: The crewâ€™s initial plan for the arrival, using autobrake setting 1 and thrust reversers to provide minimal deceleration, was consistent with existing guidance that a wet runway should provide good braking action.. The pilot flying intentionally disarmed the autobrake by retracting the spoilers at 103 knots and no manual brake application occurred until 16 seconds after touchdown. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the pilot flying judged that there was sufficient runway remaining when the spoilers were retracted, based on the observed runway condition.. Safety Action taken by WestJet during the course of the Investigation was noted as having included the addition of wet runway landings to recurrent simulator sessions and more attention to the subject of safe landings during pilots' recurrent classroom training. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 29 March 2017 and it was officially released on 16 May 2017. No Safety Recommendations were made.
