On 14 April 2012, the crew of a Boeing 737-300 being operated by Titan Airways on a passenger flight from Chambery to London Gatwick found that the aircraft did not become airborne from runway 36 at Chambery following rotation at the calculated speed and when it eventually did, a tailscrape occurred.
