An Investigation was carried out by the Jordan Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission (CARC). Data from the DFDR and CVR were downloaded and used to inform the Investigation. It was noted that the 43 year-old Captain had a total of 7,102 flying hours, all but 102 hours on type. He had joined the airline on 1 May 2017 and had been appointed as the nominated Flight Operations Post Holder for the airline later the same month. The 29 year-old First Officer had a total of 1,662 hours, all but 213 hours on type having joined the Company three months prior to the accident in his first appointment as a professional pilot. It was established that after a delayed departure from Amman on a two sector flight which was scheduled as an 11:30 hours flight duty period (FDP) with an applicable maximum FDP of 12 hours, the Captain was keen to make up time. En-route to Aqaba on what was going to be an approximately 35 minute flight, the Captain, who was acting as PM, contacted Aqaba ATC to request a straight in approach to runway 19 and the request was noted. Whilst awaiting a decision, the Captain briefly took over as PF so that the First Officer could set up for the anticipated 19 approach, which would be conducted using VNAV as the 19 ILS was out of service. When ATC subsequently called the flight to ask if they would be able to maintain high speed for a runway 19 landing, the Captain, now PM again, responded in the affirmative and this was approved. The crew were aware throughout that the crosswind component for a landing on runway 19 based on the received METAR was 10/12 knots and that this potentially exceeded the 10 knot AFM limitation for landing. The Captain explicitly accepted this when reminded of it by the Aqaba APP controller. The visual approach was initially flown with the AP engaged and LVL CHG and LNAV modes selected. Engine thrust remained at Idle throughout the approach. As the aircraft descended through 2,500 feet agl approximately 1½ minutes from touchdown, it was descending at around 3,000 fpm at around 260 KCAS. Landing clearance was given at around 1500 feet agl with a spot wind of 010° at 12 knots. Half a minute later, at 1,215 feet agl, the AP and A/T were recorded as having disconnected and a few seconds later, at approximately 900 feet agl, the first EGPWS ‘SINK RATE’ Alert was annunciated. At around 850 feet agl, the VNAV ‘LVL CHG’ mode began to transition to ‘ALT ACQ’ and at 650 feet, the Flap 1 was selected. Passing 500 feet agl, with the computed airspeed 218 KCAS and the rate of descent now reduced to 1,200 fpm, Flap 2 was selected and further EGPWS ‘SINK RATE’ and ‘TOO LOW TERRAIN’ Alerts followed, the latter due to the flaps not yet being at a landing setting. At 220 feet agl, Flap 5 was selected and at approximately 135 feet
