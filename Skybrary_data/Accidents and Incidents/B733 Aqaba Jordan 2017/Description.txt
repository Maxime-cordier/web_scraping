On 17 September 2017, a Boeing 737-300 (JY-SOA) being operated by Solitaire Air on behalf of Royal Wings on an international charter flight from Amman to Dubai World Central via Aqaba as RWY 6888 departed the end of the Aqaba runway after a fast and late touchdown following an unstable approach in day VMC. None of the occupants were injured but the overrun led to serious left engine impact damage, right engine sand/dust ingestion, damage to the right main landing gear, superficial damage to the lower fuselage and minor damage to the passenger cabin trim. After recovery, the aircraft was withdrawn from service for repairs. Left engine impact also led to some of the runway 01 approach lights being damaged.
