a maximum of 152 days away from its next overhaul. FedEx “produced no documentation or data analysis supporting the longer overhaul interval”. The NTSB observed that “if FedEx had not adopted an overhaul limit that exceeded the manufacturer's recommendation, the fatigue crack in the accident MLG cylinder, which was last overhauled 8½ years before the accident, likely would have been detected and addressed before it could progress to failure”. The Investigation determined that the Probable Cause of the accident was “the failure of the left main landing gear (MLG) due to fatigue cracking that initiated at a corrosion pit [which] formed in the absence of a required protective cadmium coating the cause of which could not be determined from available evidence”. A Contributory Factor to the failure of the left MLG was also identified as “the operator's overhaul limit, which exceeded that recommended by the airplane manufacturer without sufficient data and analysis to ensure crack detection before it progressed to failure”. Safety Action taken as a result of the findings of the Investigation was noted as having included the following: The maintenance facility that performed the last MLG cylinder overhaul on the accident aircraft has introduced a tank dip method for plating air filler valve bores, which provides improved uniformity, adherence, and coverage over the brush plating method.. FedEx has reverted to an 8-year overhaul limit for all MLG cylinders used in its MD-10-10F fleet, as recommended by the MLG manufacturer.. The Final Report was published on 23 August 2018. No Safety Recommendations were made.
