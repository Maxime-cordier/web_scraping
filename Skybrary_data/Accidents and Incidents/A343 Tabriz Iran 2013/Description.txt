On 18 April 2013, an Airbus A340-300 (9M-XAC) being operated by Air Asia on an international passenger flight from Tabriz to Medina for Saudi Arabian Airlines as SVA 2869 failed to complete an attempted 180Â° turn to align with the cleared take off direction in normal night visibility after backtracking the full length of the runway and the nose gear departed the side of the paved surface into soft ground and became stuck. The 295 passengers were disembarked and the aircraft subsequently recovered using ground equipment. On subsequent inspection by the Air Asia engineer accompanying the aircraft, it was found to be undamaged.
