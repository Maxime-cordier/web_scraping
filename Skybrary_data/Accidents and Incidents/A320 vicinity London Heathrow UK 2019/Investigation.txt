A Field Investigation was carried out by the UK AAIB with data available from the CVR, FDR and a DAR, the latter providing additional data parameters to those available on the FDR. It was noted that the 43 year-old Captain had a total of 12,700 hours flying experience which included 6,000 hours on type. Corresponding details in respect of the First Officer were not recorded. It was also noted that both pilots had previously been involved in separate fume events on the same aircraft type and reported that they had discussed these experiences during the previous evening whilst on their rostered night stop at Zurich. The investigated event occurred during their first flight the following morning.
