On 23 September 2019, an Airbus A320 (G-EUYB) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Zurich to London Heathrow was passing 4000 feet QNH in day VMC on an ILS approach to destination runway 27L when “strong acrid fumes” were detected on the flight deck. Both pilots donned oxygen masks, a ‘PAN’ was declared to ATC and after landing without further consequences, the aircraft was stopped once clear of the runway. The absence of any smell in the passenger cabin was confirmed but when the pilots removed their masks, the First Officer became incapacitated and after the engines had been shut down, both pilots were taken to hospital with “minor injury” recorded and all other unaffected occupants then disembarked by bus.
