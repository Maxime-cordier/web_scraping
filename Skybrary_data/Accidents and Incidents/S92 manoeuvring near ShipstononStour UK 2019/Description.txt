On 14 October 2019, the crew of a Sikorsky S92A (G-LAWX) being operated by Starspeed on a private commercial passenger flight from Birmingham to a private landing site near Shipston-on-Stour were attempting to locate their intended destination in marginal day VMC when they became uncertain of their position and descended to within 28 feet agl of rising terrain close to a house before the engines were significantly over-torqued when making an unstable emergency climb into IMC. A second approach at night was initially unstable but then unexpectedly successful. The helicopter was deemed in need of maintenance inspections and was subsequently ferried to London Stansted where it was eventually found that no damage had been caused during the unsuccessful first approach.
