not uncommon for task fixation to occur during highly automatic or learned behaviour", especially during a time-critical situation. The USAF Investigation concluded that the Cause of the accident was "a combination of the Controller issuing a radar vector directing the F-16 Pilot to immediately turn left onto 180Â° and placing the F16 and the Cessna 150M on a collision course and the fact that neither pilot was able to see and avoid each other in time to prevent a collision". Three 'substantial' Contributory Factors were also identified: The Controller directed the F16 to fly on a course and at an altitude that would increase potential for conflicts by passing in close proximity of the departure routes of an uncontrolled airfield.. Neither pilot used the available systems which may have increased situational awareness.. The Controller did not provide the F16 pilot with traffic information in time for them to identify the conflict before the same controller issued the immediate left turn instruction.. The NTSB Investigation determined that the Probable Cause of the accident was "the approach controller's failure to provide an appropriate resolution to the conflict between the F-16 and the Cessna". A Contributory Cause was identified as "the inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept, resulting in both pilots' inability to take evasive action in time to avert the collision". Safety Action taken after the accident both by the NTSB and locally by the Berkeley County Airport operator was aimed at raising collision risk awareness and, in the light of the limitations of see-and-avoid, promoting the full use of all available support systems especially, in the case of VFR aircraft, requesting flight-following by ATC in Class 'E' airspace. The Final Report of the NTSB Investigation was adopted and published on 15 November 2016 and the Final Report of the USAF AIB Investigation was completed on 24 October 2016 and released on 9 December 2016.
