On 7 July 2015, a Lockheed-Martin F16CM (96-0085) being operated by the US Air Force on an instrument procedures training mission also intended to function as a post-maintenance airworthiness function flight from and returning to Shaw AFB and a privately operated Cessna 150M (N3601V) which had just departed Berkeley County Airport were involved in a mid-air collision in day VMC. The Cessna was disabled and crashed nearby killing both occupants and impact damage to the F16 prevented continued flight so its pilot ejected, sustaining minor injuries, and the aircraft crashed and was destroyed by impact forces and a post-crash fire. The F16 pilot transmitted a MAYDAY after ejecting.
