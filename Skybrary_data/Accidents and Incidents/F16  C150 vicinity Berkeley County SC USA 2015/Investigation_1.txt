An Investigation was carried out by both the NTSB and the USAF. The Investigations were based primarily on the recordings of ATC radar and ATC radio communications with the F16; the Cessna 150 was not in communication with any air traffic service and its pilot had not filed a Flight Plan. The Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) and the Seat Data Recorder (SDR) from the F16 were recovered and their data were used to confirm that there had been no relevant airworthiness issues with that aircraft. The weather conditions were benign with good in-flight visibility and were not a collision risk factor. It was recorded that the 34 year old F16 pilot had approximately 2,383 hours total flying time which included 624 hours on type and 1,511 as a ground based pilot of the MQ1B and the MQ9. The 30 year old Cessna 150 pilot had gained his PPL just over six months previously and had 244 total flying hours of which 239 hours were on type. It was established that the collision took place in Class 'E' airspace which had a base of 700 feet agl (800 feet QNH) and that having taken off from a non-towered airport, the Cessna was not - nor was it required to be - in contact with any ATS provider. The F16 which had earlier in the sortie (for which an IFR flight plan had been filed) made two practice approaches at Myrtle Beach, was in transit from there to Charleston for further practice approaches before returning to Shaw AFB. The pilot had contacted the Charleston radar control frequency when approximately 45 miles to the northeast of the airport at 6,000 ft QNH. After requesting radar vectors for an approach to runway 15 at Charleston, the pilot was instructed to fly a 260° radar heading and descend to 1,600 feet QNH which was the Minimum radar Vectoring Altitude (MVA). The resulting track and altitude meant that the F16 would pass about 2 miles south of Berkeley County Airport and be 500 feet above the standard circuit altitude there. The Radar controller was "controlling other aircraft at the time" but characterised her consequential workload as "light" and "routine". As the descent of the F16 to 1,600 feet occurred, there "were no conflicts or other aircraft along its route". Less than a minute after the F16 had reached 1,600 feet, the Cessna 150, which had just taken off from runway 23, appeared on radar with a Mode C transponder ID showing 200 feet QNH "approximately 16 miles to the east of the F16". The radar controller "assumed that the Cessna 150 intended to stay below 1,000 feet QNH within the Berkeley Airport circuit to practice landings". She "did not advise the F16 of the C150's presence […] it had already broken the controller's assumption by climbing above 1,000 feet" by which time it had taken up an east south easterly track away from the circuit and established a steady rate of climb at about 400
