On 16 August 2001, a Boeing 737-500 being operated by Continental Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Cleveland OH to Dallas Fort Worth TX and a Boeing 737-300 being operated on a scheduled passenger flight from Dallas Fort Worth to Oakland CA almost collided in normal day visibility when the just-landed aircraft crossed the runway on which the departing aircraft was taking off. The latter was able to get airborne just in time to pass over the taxiing aircraft but returned to land because a suspected - and subsequently confirmed - tail strike sustained during the avoidance manoeuvre.
