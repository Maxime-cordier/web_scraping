An Investigation was carried out by the Air Accident Investigation Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK). Both the DFDR and the CVR were recovered from the wreckage and their data were successfully downloaded. Most of the recorded exchanges between the pilots on the flight deck were in Turkish. The 58 year-old Captain, who was PF for the accident flight, had accumulated a total of 10,808 total flying hours of which 820 hours were on type obtained under training for and then as commander. It was noted that seven years earlier when he was an Airbus A300 First Officer, he had been involved in a landing accident involving the collapse of the left hand main gear. The 59 year-old First Officer had accumulated 5,894 total flying hours of which 1,758 hours were on type. Both pilots had formerly been in the Turkish Air Force and both had had three days off in Hong Kong prior to commencing the accident flight. A loadmaster and an Aircraft Technician were also on board. The flight departed Hong Kong with the crew aware that they were likely to encounter low visibility at Bishkek. Having anticipated this, and also having noted generally similar conditions at the two alternates, Astana and Karaganda, a briefing for a low visibility ILS approach to and automatic landing on the 4,204 metre-long, 55 metre-wide runway 26 at Bishkek was conducted. This ILS had a standard 3Â° glideslope and was Cat 2 capable. The corresponding 100 feet Cat 2 DH, minimum RVR of 350 metres and the runway threshold elevation of 2,055 feet were noted. Descent from FL340, initially to FL 220, was commenced at 131 nm from Bishkek and after receiving the latest weather, which included RVRs of 400 metres, 325 metres and 400 metres and a vertical visibility of 400 feet. Descent clearance below FL220 was given just 15 minutes prior to the likely landing time as a result of mountainous terrain below. As the aircraft continued towards the procedure initial approach fix (IAF) 16.2 nm from touchdown, the aircraft was still high despite speedbrake deployment and crossed this position at 9,200 feet, well above the specified crossing altitude of FL 060. Shortly after this, the QNH of 1023 hPa was given by ATC and set by the crew and clearance to commence the runway 26 ILS approach was given with descent to the procedure 'platform' of 3400 feet QNH. At 12.5 nm range, the aircraft was at 250 KCAS and the first stage of flap was selected. CVR data showed that by this stage the crew were monitoring altitude and aware that they were still high. Deteriorating RVRs had been passed by ATC during the descent with the one given when the flight was in the vicinity of the IAF being 300 metres in freezing fog, this RVR being below the 350 metre ILS Cat 2 minimum although it had then improved slightly to 400 metres, 350 metres, 400 metres.
