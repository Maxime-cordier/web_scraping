On 2 July 2004, a Boeing 737-800 being operated by Irish operator Ryanair on a scheduled passenger flight from London Stansted to Skavsta Sweden, completed an extremely high speed and unstable approach in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) to destination during which relevant Operator SOPs were comprehensively ignored, Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) warnings were not actioned and AFM limits for trailing edge flap deployment were breached. Despite this, a landing at excessive speed was accommodated by just within the full length of the 2878 metre long dry runway.
