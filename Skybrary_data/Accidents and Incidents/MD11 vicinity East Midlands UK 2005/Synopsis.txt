The following is the Synopsis from the UK AAIB report: "The incident occurred during an approach to Nottingham East Midlands Airport when the crew were distracted and omitted to set the arrival QNH of 974 mb on any of the three altimeters despite having acknowledged the setting to ATC. When the crew levelled at 2000 ft, ATC questioned the aircraftâ€™s pressure setting because the radar display indicated that the aircraft was much lower than cleared. At the time, the crew were visual with the approach lights."
