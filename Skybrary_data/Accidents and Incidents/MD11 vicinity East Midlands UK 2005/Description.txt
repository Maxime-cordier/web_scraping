On 3 December 2005, the crew of a MD-11 freighter failed to set the (very low) Altimeter Pressure Settings for a night approach, due to distraction, and as a result descended well below the cleared altitude given by ATC for the intercept heading for the Instrument Landing System (ILS) at Nottingham East Midlands airport, UK.
