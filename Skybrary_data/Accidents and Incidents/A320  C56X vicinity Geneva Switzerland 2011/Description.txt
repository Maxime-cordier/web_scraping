On 17 August 2012, an Airbus 320 being operated by Swiss on a scheduled passenger flight from Barcelona to Geneva lost separation in Class ‘C’ airspace against a Cessna Citation Excel being operated by German air taxi company Augusta Air inbound to Geneva from Augsburg in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). Both aircraft were operating in accordance with valid ATC clearances and the sector concerned was being operated by a Trainee and OJT pairing. After the conflict was recognised, ATC de-confliction instructions were given but a co-ordinated TCAS RA activation also occurred just after this before the two aircraft closed to less than 1nm laterally when separated by less than 400 feet vertically.
