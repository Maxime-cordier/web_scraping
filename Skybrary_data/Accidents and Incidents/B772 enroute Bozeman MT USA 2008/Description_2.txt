of entrained water could form ice crystals and that, when localised fuel temperatures are in the ‘sticky range’ (-5 to -20 °C), ice can accumulate along the internal components of the fuel system and that this ice could be released during higher fuel flows and subsequently travel downstream through the system”. This testing also led to the conclusion that “the Rolls-Royce Trent 800 FOHE inlet face could be obstructed by a concentration of ice sufficient to restrict the fuel flow to a value similar to that recorded during the incident flight and that “reducing the volume of the fuel flow through the FOHE allows the heat of the oil to melt the ice, allowing for a recovery to normal operation” as had occurred. The investigation determined that the following sequence of events had occurred during the incident flight: ice formation from the normal amounts of entrained water in the fuel.. ice accretion and subsequent release of ice from the area of accretion (possibly at more than one distinct time).. ice travel through the fuel system to collect on, and obstruct the flow through, the FOHE inlet face.. Although the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had concluded that the aircraft type fuel system had met existing certification requirements, it noted that “ice accumulation in the aircraft and engine fuel feed system upstream of the FOHE had not been anticipated” by the engine manufacturers or the regulators and that “ under certain conditions, the ice could release and cause a restriction at the FOHE that would limit fuel flow to the engines”. In March 2009, in response to the ongoing investigations into both the Heathrow accident and the Delta Incident which was the subject of their investigation, the NTSB issued the following four Safety Recommendations in respect of the design of the FOHE fitted to the Trent 800 series engine to ensure that future designs are tolerant to the threat of ice concentrations: That the FAA require that Rolls-Royce redesign the RB211 Trent 800 series engine fuel/oil heat exchanger (FOHE) such that ice accumulation on the face of the FOHE will not restrict fuel flow to the extent that the ability to achieve commanded thrust is reduced.. (A-09-17) That the FAA, once the fuel/oil heat exchanger (FOHE) is redesigned and approved by certification authorities, require that operators of Boeing 777-200 airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 800 series engines install the redesigned FOHE at the next scheduled maintenance opportunity or within 6 months after the revised FOHE design has been certificated, whichever comes first.. (A-09-18) That the EASA require that Rolls-Royce redesign the RB211 Trent 800 series engine fuel/oil heat exchanger (FOHE) such that ice accumulation on the face of the FOHE will not restrict fuel flow to the extent that the ability to achieve commanded thrust is reduced.. (A-09-19) That the EASA, once the fuel/oil heat exchanger (FOHE) is redesigned and approved by certification authorities, require that operators of Boeing 777-200 airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 800 series engines install the
