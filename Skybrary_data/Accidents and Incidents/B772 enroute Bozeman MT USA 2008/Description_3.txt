redesigned FOHE at the next scheduled maintenance opportunity or within 6 months after the revised FOHE design has been certificated, whichever comes first.. (A-09-20) Subsequent action as recommended resulted in all Rolls Royce-powered Boeing 777s being fitted with a new design of FOHE during September 2010 The Probable Cause was determined "An accumulation of ice in the fuel system, which formed from the water normally present in jet fuel during commonly encountered flight conditions, which accreted and released, restricting the fuel flow at the right engine fuel-oil heat exchanger inlet face". A Contributory Factor was also identified as: Certification requirements (with which the aircraft and engine fuel systems were in compliance), which did not account for the possibility of ice accumulating and subsequently releasing in the aircraft and engine fuel feed system upstream of the fuel-oil heat exchanger.. The NTSB Final Report of the Investigation was adopted on 27 June 2011.
