On 15 August 2018, the crew of a Boeing 737-300SF (VH-XMO) being operated by Qantas-owned Express Freighters Australia on a non-scheduled domestic cargo flight from Brisbane to Queensland in unrecorded night meteorological conditions were concerned that after responding to a bleed air leak indication, the system concerned was not completely isolated. A series of further ad-hoc actions were then followed by circumstances which prompted an emergency descent and a MAYDAY diversion to Canberra with temporary incapacitation of the Captain and then incapacitation of the First Officer. Both pilots passed all heath checks after completing the flight.
