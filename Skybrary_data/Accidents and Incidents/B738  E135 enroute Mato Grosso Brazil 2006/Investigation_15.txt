106/A/07]. that the DECEA shall include alterations in the STVD (Data Treatment and Visualisation System), so that it records any occurrence of non-compliance with the separation minima prescribed in the operational models (safety bubble) and automatically generates a preventative report of the occurrence data. [RSV (A) 118/A/07]. that the DECEA shall analyse the possibility of including features which enable the re-visualization software of the STVD (Data Treatment and Visualisation System) to synchronise the audio and video of the selected console, while recording the operations performed by the controller in the area of commands, including the keys operated. [RSV (A) 119/A/07]. that the DECEA shall ensure that the Aeronautical Mobile Service Plan of Frequencies guarantees the coverage of the emergency frequency 121.500 MHz in all the stations which are the responsibility of the SISCEAB (Brazilian Air Traffic Control System). [RSV (A) 122/A/07]. that the COMGEP (General Command of Personnel) shall devise a plan for the re-manning of the air traffic control branch, setting up measures to be adopted in the short, medium and long terms, with the objective of meeting the need for human resources on the part of SISCEAB (Brazilian Air Traffic Control System). [RSV (A) 77/A/07]. that the DEPENS (Department of Education) shall establish a minimum level of proficiency in the English language for air traffic controller (BCT) candidates which is consistent with the requirements of the ICAO plan for 2008, as a criterion for the classification of CFS (Sergeant Formation Course) candidates at the EEAR (School of Aeronautical Specialists). [RSV (A) 78/A/07]. that the DEPENS shall, in the CFS (Sergeant course) entrance exams, include specific criteria for the psychological (IPA) and medical (DIRSA- Directorate of Aeronautical Health) classification of air traffic controller (BCT) candidates. [RSV (A) 79/A/07]. On 28 November 2007, 5 Safety Recommendations were issued as follows: that the DECEA shall immediately include requisites in the STVD on the installation of Cleared Level Adherence Monitoring (CLAM), a functionality which verifies that the detected flight level is the same as the cleared flight level and generates an alert if any deviation from standards is found, so as to improve the prescribed alerts that warn controllers of the occurrence of a discrepancy between the received information on the real flight level of the aircraft and the level authorised. [RSV (A) 202/A/08]. that the ANAC (Brazilian Civil Aviation Agency) should evaluate, in coordination with DECEA, the current legislation concerning the utilisation of aeronautical publications by aircraft operating in the Brazilian airspace with the aim of mitigating the risk of outdated and/or incorrect data being used. [RSV (A) 205/A/08]. that the ICAO should revise the provisions contained in the ICAO documents which deal with the procedures for communications failure so that pilots and ATCOs alike have a clear understanding of the situation and procedures are harmonised worldwide. [RSV (A) 203/A/08]. that the (United States) FAA should evaluate the existing requirements to verify whether the training requirements for international flight operations under 14 CFR Part 91, especially with high performance jets and
