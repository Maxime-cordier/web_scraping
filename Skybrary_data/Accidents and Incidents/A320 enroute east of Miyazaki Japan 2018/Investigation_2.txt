Wake Turbulence Encountersâ€™ and that in the case of 1000 foot vertical separation in RVSM airspace, atmospheric turbulence attributable to wake vortex may still be present at up to 25 nm behind the source aeroplane and may have drifted away from the track flown. It was concluded that this meant that the prevention of similar accidents may be usefully assisted if when in RVSM airspace, flight crew were to make a precautionary PA whenever they observe traffic above and up to 25 nm away on a track which they may subsequently encounter. The Investigation documented the Probable Cause of the accident as an upset to the aircraft during the cruise caused by wake turbulence from another aircraft which still remained along and below its flight path and which caused one of the cabin crew to fall and sustain injury. Safety Action taken by Vanilla Air as a result of the findings of the Investigation were recorded as having included but not been limited to the provision of additional guidance to cabin crew on how best to respond if unexpected turbulence occurs and on the importance of reporting turbulence encounters even where no injury results and the role of the Senior Cabin Crew Member (SCCM) in that process. The Final Report was adopted by the JTSB on 10 May 2019 and published on 30 May 2019. No Safety Recommendations were made.
