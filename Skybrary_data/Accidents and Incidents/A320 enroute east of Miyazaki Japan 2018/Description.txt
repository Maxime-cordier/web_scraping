On 27 August 2018, an Airbus A320 (JA14VA) being operated by Vanilla Air on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Kansai to Amami as JW873 (callsign JA14VA) and in the cruise at FL300 in day VMC was suddenly subjected to a short period of turbulence in otherwise smooth flight conditions during which one of the cabin crew fell without apparently sustaining any injury beyond possible bruising. Subsequent to the completion of the remainder of the flight duty that day, a sustained pain without improving trend caused her to undergo a hospital examination that identified a minor spinal fracture which led to an accident investigation being opened.
