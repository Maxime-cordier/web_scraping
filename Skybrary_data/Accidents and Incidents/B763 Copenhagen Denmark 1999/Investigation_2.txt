Take Off Weight 186, 800kg (123,500)V1 = 166 knots (133 knots)Vr = 166 knots (133 knots)V2 = 172 knots (139 knots) The Investigation concluded that the take-off performance calculation was based on a too low a take off weight so that the values used for V1, Vr and V2 were too low. The wrong value of Vr resulted in the aircraft being rotated at too low a speed. The check of the take-off performance data was not sufficient. The Final Report of the Investigation may be seen in full at SKYbrary bookshelf" HCL 49/99 Three Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation and are reproduced as published in the Report below: REK-01-2000 That the Danish Civil Aviation Administration ensures that the commander makes an estimate of the flight performance data and flight planning data. The estimate shall as a minimum cover: a. Estimated en route time. b. Trip fuel. c. Zero Fuel Mass. d. Take-off Mass. e. Take-off Speeds. f. Landing Mass. g. Landing Speeds. REK-02-2000 That the Danish Civil Aviation Administration ensures that the layout of flight data reduces the possibility of mistakes. REK-03-2000 That the Danish Civil Aviation Administration, when approving operators FOM, complies with ICAO Standard 6.3.10.
