On 18 March 2020, a Fokker 100 (P2-ANF) being operated by Air Niugini was on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Boram to Port Moresby in day VMC when bleed air malfunctions were annunciated during the climb. Approaching FL300 enroute to an intended cruise altitude of FL350, a rapid rise in cabin altitude occurred and both bleed air systems failed prompting both pilots to don oxygen masks. As an Emergency Descent was commenced, the rapid rise in cabin altitude resulted in an Excessive Cabin Altitude Warning. A PAN was declared and taking account of terrain, a diversion to Madang was completed without further event. The annotated ground track of the flight (Port Moresby is indicated as Jackson International). [Reproduced from the Official Report]
