On 30 March 2017, a Boeing 787-9 (9V-OJA) being operated by Scoot was taxiing for departure on a scheduled passenger flight from Singapore in normal night visibility when it was in wingtip-to-wingtip collision with a stationary Airbus A380-861 being operated by Emirates which had just been pushed back from its parking gate for departure. Both wingtips were damaged but the 787 crew were only alerted to the fact that impact was likely to have occurred when they heard the A380 requesting a return to the gate because of damage and, upon confirming by inspection that their aircraft was also damaged, also requested clearance to a parking bay.
