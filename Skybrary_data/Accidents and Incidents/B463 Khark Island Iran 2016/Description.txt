On 19 June 2016, a BAe 146-300 (EP-MOF) being operated by Mahan Airlines on a domestic passenger flight from Ahwaz to Khark Island as IRM 4525 landed long off a visual approach to runway 13 at destination in the early afternoon and overran the end of the runway by 54 metres. The nose gear collapsed soon after the aircraft left the paved surface causing significant structural damage to the front of the aircraft which was subsequently declared a hull loss. An emergency evacuation was performed on the orders of the Captain; none of the 89 occupants were injured but due to damage to the door separating the flight deck from the passenger cabin, the flight crew evacuated via the side windows and using the escape ropes provided for that purpose.
