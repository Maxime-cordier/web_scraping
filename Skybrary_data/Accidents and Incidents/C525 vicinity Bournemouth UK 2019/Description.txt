On 13 April 2019, a Cessna 525 (N680KH) being operated on a private flight from Bournemouth to Rotterdam under IFR suffered a system malfunction in day VMC shortly after takeoff which caused control difficulties which led to an upset and unintended terrain proximity. Sufficient control was regained to make a return to land possible and none of the four occupants were injured. Although no emergency was declared, ATC received a call from the pilot saying he “had a problem” and, after observing the erratic flight path of the aircraft and the lack of response to their subsequent calls, had initiated a full emergency procedure.
