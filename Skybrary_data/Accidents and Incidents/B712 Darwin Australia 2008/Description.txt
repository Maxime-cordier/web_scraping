On 7 February 2008, a Boeing 717-200 being operated by Australian airline National Jet on a scheduled passenger service from Nhulunbuy (Gove) to Darwin flew an unstabilised night visual approach at the destination and made a very hard landing. The landing roll was completed and the aircraft taxied to the terminal. None of the 94 occupants were injured but the aircraft was suffered substantial structural damage and damage to the left hand main landing gear.
