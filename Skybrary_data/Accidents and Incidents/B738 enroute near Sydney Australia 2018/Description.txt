On 12 July 2018, a Boeing 737-800 (VH-VUB) being operated by Tiger Airways on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Sydney to Melbourne during daylight hours on a line training flight for the First Officer was passing FL 135 in the climb approximately 6 minutes after takeoff when the cabin altitude warning horn sounded. The trainee First Officer immediately recognised that both air conditioning packs were switched off and selected them to on and the Captain took control and descended the aircraft to FL100 until pressurisation was normalised after which the flight was completed without further event.
