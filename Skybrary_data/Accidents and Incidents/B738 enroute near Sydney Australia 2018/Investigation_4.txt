system.. The incorrect configuration was the result of procedures and checklists not being managed appropriately.. Safety Action taken by Tiger Airways as a result of the event and known to the Investigation prior to its completion was noted as having included the following: A formal reminder was issued to flight crew that Checklist Actions must be followed by conscious verification of the action taken and that when conducting checklists, flight crew must be mindful to ‘challenge - verify - respond’ and that verification is to be a very deliberate act undertaken by both the Pilot Flying (PF) and Pilot Monitoring (PM).. A flight operations safety assurance program was introduced to undertake flight deck observations to identify potential adverse trends in procedural compliance. Tiger Airways advised that only minor observations had been noted.. A review of the Boeing 737 Normal Checklist is being conducted by the airline’s Flight Standards team to see if additional checks of pressurisation system status are required and the airline’s Flight Training team is undertaking a review of Safety Pilot requirements.. A programme to allow Virgin Australia to assist with the airline’s 737 line training has been established in order to ensure pilots have sufficient continuity of line training to effectively embed skills and knowledge.. The Final Report was released on 30 September 2019. No Safety Recommendations were made.
