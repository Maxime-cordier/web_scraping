The Report includes the following conclusions: "Pushbacks are a routine manoeuvre, normally performed with headset communications between the flight deck and the pushback crew. The airport instructions and the operator’s towing procedures make no allowance for aircraft pushbacks without headsets. Nevertheless, it was not unusual for them to be conducted using hand signals only. Ground handling staff have now been instructed to use a headset at all times. A routine pushback became unusual when it was necessary to return the aircraft to stand. There’s no hand signal for ‘I would like to return to stand’ and the commander had difficulty in conveying his wishes to the pushback crew. The resulting breakdown in communication led to the aircraft being damaged." The Report produces no Safety Recommendations.
