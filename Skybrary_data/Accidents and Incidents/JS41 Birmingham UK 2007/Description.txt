The Report into the Accident produced by UK AAIB states: "The aircraft was pushed back from Stand 2 at Birmingham Airport onto the centerline of Taxiway W, the parking brake was applied and the nose wheel was chocked. After the pushback the ground crew were unable to disconnect the towbar. The aircraft commander decided to return the aircraft to the stand. Headsets had not been used during the pushback and communication was via hand signals. The tug attempted to pull the aircraft back onto stand whilst the aircraft parking brake was still applied, and the nose gear collapsed."
