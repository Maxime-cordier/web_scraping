the actuator ball nuts due to condensation facilitating jamming in cold temperatures and long flights. It noted that during troubleshooting of trim malfunctions, the effects of the low temperature disappear so that operators may ”misdiagnose the root cause and replace the HS-ACE”. It was also observed that the Covid pandemic had led to the aircraft involved in the investigated event to be parked out of service for a lot longer than usual which may have affected the effectiveness of actuator lubrication which had caused them to include lubrication of the horizontal stabiliser in the ‘return-to-service’ preparations after prolonged parking. An unconnected sensor failure in the nosewheel steering system was found to be the cause of that (unconnected) malfunction and was replaced. The Conclusion of the Investigation was formally documented as follows: The failure of the pitch trim system probably occurred because of jamming of the horizontal stabiliser as a result of freezing of water ingression in the ball nut due to condensation. The Investigation found that the operator had lubricated the horizontal stabiliser at the intervals specified by the manufacturer to prevent such an occurrence. Jamming of the horizontal stabiliser resulted in the loss of the pitch trim functionality. Consequently, the PF [First Officer] experienced greater than normal nose-down pitch forces on the approach. The PF delegated the monitoring of the throttles, which were still in autothrottle, to the PM [Captain] to allow him to use both hands on the yoke. The PF flew a stable approach and made a safe landing. However, on landing, the steer fail caution illuminated, as a result of an unrelated sensor failure. The Captain took control and brought the aircraft to a safe stop and taxied the aircraft to stand using differential braking. The Final Report was published on 13 October 2022. No Safety Recommendations were made.
