On 7 June 2021 an Embraer ERJ170 (G-CIXW) being operated by Eastern Airways on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Gibraltar to Birmingham had just begun descent from FL 380 when both primary and secondary pitch trim systems failed. The resultant excessive nose-down control forces in pitch and inoperative autopilot were addressed by the use of two hands on the control column. The remainder of the flight was completed without further event but during the landing roll the nosewheel steering system also failed.
