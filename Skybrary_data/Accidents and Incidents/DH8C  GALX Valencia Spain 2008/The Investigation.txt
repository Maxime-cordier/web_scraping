An Accident Investigation was carried out by the Spanish Accident Investigation Agency, the Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes e Incidentes de Aviación Civil (CIAIAC). They determined that the cause of the collision was the inappropriate clearance given by ATC to the DHC8 to continue taxing on the parallel taxiway and the subsequent misjudgment made by the DHC8 crew as to safe clearance. They noted that the Gulfstream was stopped at the correct point and that a larger aircraft in the same position would have visibly blocked the parallel taxiway, this precluding the possibility of a collision. Aspects of the design of the airport in relation to the accident were examined and, whilst found to be not directly relevant to the collision, it was determined that various markings, lights and signs were not correctly represented on the AIP Aerodrome Chart and that some were not in accordance with Annex 14 SARPs. A corresponding Safety Recommendation was made to the Airport Operator and accepted.
