On 11 February 2008, a Gulfstream G200 being operated on a public transport passenger charter flight by Executive Airlines had landed on Runway 30 at Valencia and cleared the Runway to the right to taxi back on the parallel taxiway before stopping at a later intersection to wait for clearance to cross the same runway to the South Apron. The next aircraft to land, A DHC8-300 being operated by Air Nostrum on a scheduled passenger flight cleared Runway 30 further down and then also exited to the right and was cleared to taxi along it to the North Apron past the waiting Gulfstream. Although it was dark, the DHC8 crew believed that there would be sufficient clearance to safely pass the stopped aircraft but this turned out not to be the case and as a consequence of the ensuing slight collision, minor damage was caused to both aircraft.
