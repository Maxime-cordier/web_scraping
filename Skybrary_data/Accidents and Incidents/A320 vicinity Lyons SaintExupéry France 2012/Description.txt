On 11 April 2012, the crew of an Airbus AIRBUS A-320 (SX-BHV) being operated by Hermes Airlines on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Ajaccio to Lyons Saint-Exup√©ry in night Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and cleared to join the ILS at Lyons descended towards terrain until a combination of Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) PULL UP and ATC intervention based on MSAW activation led to the attempted approach being discontinued. A second uneventful approach continued to a landing. Pilot Line Training was in progress.
