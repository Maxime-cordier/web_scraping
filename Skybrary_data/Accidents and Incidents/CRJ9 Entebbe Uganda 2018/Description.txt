On 4 February 2018, a GE CF34-8C5 powered Bombardier CRJ900 (9XR-WH) being operated by RwandAir on a scheduled international passenger flight from Nairobi to Kigali via Entebbe as WB465 completed an apparently normal flight in daylight VMC. However, a routine external inspection after engine shutdown at Kigali found that all 28 fan blades on the left-hand engine were similarly damaged at the outermost parts of their trailing edges. The aircraft was withdrawn from service for an engine and nacelle change.
