On 20 December 2019, an Airbus A318 (F-GUGD) being operated by Air France on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Paris Orly to Toulon-Hy√®res as AF7512 in day IMC was seriously mismanaged during an autopilot-controlled ILS glideslope capture from above and two successive alpha floor protections were triggered before a sustained recovery was achieved and the aircraft positioned for a second successful approach.
