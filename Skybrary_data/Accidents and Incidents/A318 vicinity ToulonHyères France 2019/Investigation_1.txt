An Investigation was carried out by the French Civil Aviation Accident Investigation Agency, the BEA using relevant FDR and recorded ATC data. The Captain had initially joined Air France as a First Officer on the Airbus A320 and accumulated approximately 2,300 hours on type. He had then moved to the Boeing 777 fleet also as a First Officer and accumulated just over 10,000 hours on that type before gaining his command on the A320 at the beginning of 2019. The First Officer had joined Air France ten months prior to the investigated event and completed his type conversion training six months prior to it and had 400 hours on type out of a total of 5,500 hours. With the First Officer as PF, the flight was working Toulon APP and approaching from the northwest. It was number 1 inbound and had been cleared for continuous descent to 1,900 feet QNH. The crew were informed that the surface wind was 150°/12-19 knots with runway 23 in use but given the presence of BKN (broken) cloud at 1,700 feet aal, the controller suggested that the circling approach necessary for that runway might be “a bit tight”. The crew asked if they could make an ILS approach to runway 05 which was approved and the left turn towards final approach was commenced. The speedbrakes were extended and the AP and A/THR were engaged in OP DES/NAV and THR IDLE modes respectively. The aircraft was about 16 nm away from destination and passing 6,500 feet QNH at 250 KIAS with a 2000 fpm rate of descent. Once on long final, a significant tailwind component was registered by the onboard sensors and this remained above 40 knots down to about 3000 feet QNH. Around one minute later, the aircraft passed the initial approach fix (IAF) which was located 12 nm from the runway threshold. It was descending through 5,170 feet QNH which was approximately 1,350 ft above the procedure 3° glide slope. Observing this, the controller asked the crew if they wanted to continue a direct approach or enter the holding pattern in order to descend which they declined and were therefore cleared for a direct ILS approach to runway 05 and the APPR mode was engaged (Point 3 on the illustration). The ground speed was 307 knots and the airspeed 237 knots but decreasing. A few seconds later, the airspeed was down to 220 knots and the landing gear was extended and the ILS LOC captured and the slats/flaps were then set to CONF 1. Thirty seconds later, at 6.4 nm from the runway threshold, the AP mode changed to ALT* mode as the still-selected altitude of 1,900 feet was neared but this was not noticed by either pilot and the aircraft almost immediately passed the final approach fix (FAF) situated at 5.3 nm from the runway threshold. At this point, the altitude was 2,200 ft and decreasing more slowly as the selected altitude (200 feet higher than the FAF). The crew engaged the
