On 31 July 2015 a Bombardier DHC8-400 (G-FLBB) on a scheduled international passenger flight from Ireland West/Knock to Manchester, UK and climbing through FL170 in day VMC experienced smoke and fumes in both the passenger cabin and the flight deck. A 'PAN' was declared to ATC, a descent to FL100 accomplished and oxygen masks were donned by both pilots. The smoke and fumes situation persisted but stabilised and a diversion to Dublin was made. After engine shutdown, the smoke/fumes began to clear and it was not possible to identify the source of the fumes/smoke. No ill effects were reported to have been suffered by any of the 78 occupants.
