the A319 pilot". It was unanimously agreed that the ICAO Risk Classification 'A' - that an aircraft proximity in which a serious risk of collision has existed - should be assigned. It was also noted that in the UK, paramotor pilots were not required to obtain a licence to fly or mandated to undertake any training but were subject to the same provisions of Air Law as all pilots. The Board was reminded that at the time of the incident, the Southend Airport Operator was already seeking the re-establishment of controlled airspace around the airport as a result of increased operations there since April 2012. EDITOR'S NOTE Class 'D' Controlled airspace has since been established around Southend Airport. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the UK CAA should review the regulation and licensing of paramotor pilots.. The Final Report of the Investigation and review was prepared and subsequently published following the Board meeting on 11 December 2013.
