On 25th July 2000, a Concorde being operated by Air France on a passenger charter flight from Paris CDG to New York JFK caught fire as it rotated for take off from runway 26R in normal daylight visibility and subsequently failed to maintain altitude as the fire continued. The aircraft soon lost height and was destroyed by impact with a hotel situated just over 3 nm from the upwind end of the runway. All 109 occupants and four other persons on the ground were killed and 6 other people on the ground were injured.
