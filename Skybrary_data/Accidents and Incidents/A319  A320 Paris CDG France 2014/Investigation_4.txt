cross runway 18 right.”. Crossing a runway without holding: “Rapidair 3245, keep taxiing, cross runway 18 right.”. The Conclusion of the Investigation was formally documented as follows: An inadequate phraseology was used to deal with the taxiing priorities between Air France flight 1089 and Bulgaria Air flight 431. The message “Bulgaria 4 3 1, number one, keep on taxiing” was not in fact accompanied by a reminder that the crew must hold short of runway 08L. This message led to an erroneous interpretation by the crew of the Bulgaria Air flight who understood it as a clearance to cross the runway. The crew of the Air France flight had the meaning of this message clarified. The crew of the Bulgaria flight were not able to understand the exchanges in French between the controller and the crew of the Air France flight. The controller did not connect the question from the crew of the AFR1089 flight with a possible ambiguity as to the meaning of the phraseology that he had used to manage priorities. In addition, the configuration of the Paris-CDG runways can make it difficult for crews to detect an aeroplane taking off, notably when they cross a runway. The crew of flight LZB431 thus entered runway 08L without seeing flight FHY542 taking off. The RIMCAS alarm was triggered due to the conflict. The controllers considered that it was then too late to intervene. The Final Report was published in English on 23 July 2019 along with the initial and definitive publication in French.
