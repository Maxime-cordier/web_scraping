An Investigation was carried out by the French civil aviation accident investigation agency, the BEA, based upon recorded ATC data, particularly but not only recordings from the ground radar system. It was established that at the time of the conflict, runway 08R was in use for landings and runway 08L for takeoffs. Communications between ATC and both the aircraft involved were carried out in the English language but concurrently, communications between ATC and some other aircraft were being carried out in the French language. One TWR controller, who had held an ATCO licence since 2003 and been qualified in all positions at Paris CDG since 2005, was responsible for both runways. He was being assisted in co-ordination with other positions by another fully qualified controller who had held an ATCO licence since 2008 and been qualified in all positions at Paris CDG since 2011. Shortly after the A319 had vacated runway 08R on taxiway V5 after landing, TWR instructed it to “hold short of 08 L, holding point S6” which was correctly read back. Eight seconds later, the same controller cleared the A320, which had not yet lined up, for takeoff from runway 08L. Forty-five seconds after that, the controller instructed the A319 with the words “number one, keep on taxiing” which the crew read back using the same words as used by the controller. He then immediately instructed an Air France A320 which had just landed on runway 08R and was vacating on taxiway V6 to “taxi behind the 319 Bulgaria on left” and when its crew queried whether they were “cleared to cross”, the controller responded that they were not. This exchange was carried out in French. At this time, the A319 was on taxiway S and heading east towards its intersection with taxiways V6 and S6 and the departing A320 had still not lined up on runway 08L. Forty seconds after this exchange with the arriving A320, the arriving A319, which had turned left from taxiway S onto taxiway S6 entered runway 08L from S6 to cross to taxiway T9. One second later, a red level 2 RIMCAS warning was activated with the departing A320 accelerating for takeoff on runway 08L and passing 139 KIAS approximately 1500 metres from the point where the A319 had entered the runway. The relative positions of the three aircraft ten seconds later are shown in the third illustration below. Nine seconds later, the departing A320 flew over the S6/T9 intersection by which time the A319 had cleared the runway and had stopped on taxiwayT9. It was noted that according to the configuration of the RIMCAS, the level 2 warning - which indicates a “critical” situation - would have been activated when the departing A320 was moving at a groundspeed of 20 knots or more and a “moving object” - in this case the A319 - was detected as having crossed one of the holding points protecting the runway. The crew of the departing A320 subsequently stated that they had seen the
