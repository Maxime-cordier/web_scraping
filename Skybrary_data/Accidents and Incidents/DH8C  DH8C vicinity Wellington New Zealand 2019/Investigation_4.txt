investigated event, it was noted that as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Air New Zealand at the time (it was subsequently absorbed fully into the parent company) all “Standard Operating Policies” (such as CVR protection following a potential Serious Incident) were already common to both operations. Safety Action taken or to be taken as a result of the event and known to the Investigation was noted as including the following: A revised MATS Advisory Circular was promulgated on 31 December 2020 which included new sections outlining previously unstated potential risks arising from visual approaches and describing best practice to prevent a recurrence of the investigated event from an ATC perspective.. As part of the integration of Air Nelson operations with those of parent Air New Zealand since the event, DHC8-300 pilot initial and recurrent type technical training will, from an unspecified date in 2022, include specific reminders to pilots about isolating the CVR after a serious incident and examples of such serious incidents which replicate those in Attachment C of ICAO Annex 13.. The Final Report was approved by the Commission on an unspecified date in February 2022 and published on 14 April 2022. No Safety Recommendations were made.
