On 12 March 2019, a Bombardier DHC8-300 (ZK-NEH) being operated for Air New Zealand by its wholly owned subsidiary Air Nelson on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Rotorua to Wellington as RLK235 and a second Bombardier DHC8-300 (ZK-NEF) also being operated for Air New Zealand by Air Nelson on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Gisborne to Wellington as RLK285 lost safe separation in day VMC when the second aircraft failed to follow the first during the approaching traffic sequence after requesting and accepting a visual approach. ATC detected the conflict and issued avoidance instructions and coordinated TCAS RAs followed with safe separation thereby restored.
