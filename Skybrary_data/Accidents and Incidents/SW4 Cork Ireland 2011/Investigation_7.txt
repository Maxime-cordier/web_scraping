Flight Crew members.. Inadequate command training and checking during the command upgrade of the Commander.. Inappropriate pairing of Flight Crew members.. Inadequate oversight of the remote Operation by the Operator and the State of the Operator.. Eleven Safety Recommendations were issued as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Director-General for Mobility and Transport, European Commission should review the obligations of Member States to implement penalties, in accordance with the Standardisation Regulation (EU) No 628/2013, as a result of transgressions including Flight Time Limitations as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 [IRLD2014001]. that the European Aviation Safety Agency should provide guidance to Operators concerning successive instrument approaches to an aerodrome in IMC or night VMC where a landing cannot be made due to weather reasons and incorporate such guidance in Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 accordingly. [IRLD2014002]. that the European Aviation Safety Agency should review Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 859/2008, to ensure that it contains a comprehensive syllabus for appointment to commander and that an appropriate level of command training and checking is carried out. [IRLD2014003]. that Flightline S.L. should review its current operational policy of an immediate diversion following a missed approach due to weather. [IRLD2014004]. that Flightline S.L. should implement suitable and appropriate training for personnel responsible for flight safety and accident prevention. [IRLD2014005]. that the Director-General of Mobility and Transport, European Commission should review the role of the ticket seller when engaged in providing air passenger services and restrict ticket sellers from exercising operational control of air carriers providing such services, thus ensuring that a high and uniform level of safety is achieved for the travelling public. [IRLD2014006]. that the European Aviation Safety Agency should review the process by which AOC variations are granted to ensure that the scope of any new operation is within the competence of the air carrier. [IRLD2014007]. that the Agencia Estatal de Seguridad AÃ©rea should review its policy with regard to continuing oversight of air carriers, in particular those conducting remote operations. [IRLD2014008]. that the Director-General of Mobility and Transport, European Commission should review Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 in the context of implementing Regulation (EU) No 628/2013 in order to improve safety oversight including efficacy and scope of SAFA Inspections and to provide for the extension of oversight responsibilities, particularly in cases where effective oversight may be limited due to resource issues, remote operation or otherwise. [IRLD2014009]. that the Director-General for Mobility and Transport, European Commission should review the scope of the Air Safety Committee, and consider including oversight of Operating Licences issued by Member States and the processes by which oversight is carried out. [IRLD2014010]. that the International Civil Aviation Organisation should consider the inclusion of information regarding the flight-specific approach capability of aircraft/flight crew within the proposed 'Flight and flow-Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE)'.
