On 14 January 2013, an ATR72-212 (E7-AAD) being operated on a passenger flight from Sarajevo to Copenhagen left the side of the runway at high speed shortly after touchdown on runway 22L at Copenhagen in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). After travelling on the grass and decelerating for approximately 350 metres, the aircraft regained the runway. After a visual inspection by the airport Rescue and Fire Fighting Services to confirm that no obvious damage had been sustained, the aircraft was taxied to the terminal. The aircraft was subsequently confirmed to be undamaged and there were no injuries to the 42 occupants.
