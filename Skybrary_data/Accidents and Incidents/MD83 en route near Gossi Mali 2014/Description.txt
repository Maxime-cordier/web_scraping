On 24 July 2014, radio contact with a McDonnell Douglas MD83 (EC-LTV) being operated by Spanish ACMI operator Swiftair on a scheduled international passenger flight for Air Alg√©rie from Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso to Algiers as AH5017 was lost while it was in the cruise at night in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) over central Mali. The wreckage of the aircraft was located later the same day in the vicinity of Gossi near to the Burkina Faso / Mali border and it was apparent that ground impact had led to the complete destruction of the aircraft and a post crash fire. There were no survivors from the 110 passengers and six crew members on board.
