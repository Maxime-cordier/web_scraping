at cruise altitude including where there are no visible signs of icing, specifically when the engine anti-icing system is not activated. [MLI-2015-002] and [MLI-2015-003]; [FRAN-2015-014] and [FRAN-2015-015]. that the FAA, as primary certification authority, or if not EASA, provide pilots with the means to rapidly detect an erroneous EPR indication and to remedy it. [MLI-2015-004] and [MLI-2015-005]; [FRAN-2015-016] and [FRAN-2015-017]. that the FAA and EASA study the need for similar action for other aeroplanes equipped with engines using the same thrust management principles. [MLI-2015-006] and [MLI-2015-007]; [FRAN-2015-018] and [FRAN-2015-019]. Upon completion of the Investigation, a further 10 Safety Recommendations were made, again in duplicate by both the Malian authorities and the French BEA (and in some cases also in duplicate to the FAA and EASA) as follows: that the FAA ask the manufacturer to study the feasibility of instalment of a permanent anti-icing system for the Pt2 sensors, independent of any activation by the crew of existing anti-icing systems for the engines or the airframe. [MLI-2016-001] and [FRAN-2016-022]. that the FAA require, pending the introduction of a permanent anti icing system for the Pt2 sensors that the manufacturer's FCOM procedures related to "Engine Anti-Ice on Ground and in Flight" mention the difficulties of ice crystals detection in particular at night and define clearly the associated criteria for the anti-icing systems activation. This (should) require the systematic activation of these systems in flight as soon as the Total (Air) Temperature is below 6Â°C, without (there necessarily being any) visible humidity or signs of ice accretion on the windshield wipers. [MLI-2016-002] and [FRAN-2016-023]. that the FAA require that the manufacturer integrate into the documentation provided to operators the specific features of a stall in cruise on MD 80 type aeroplanes, linked to the late appearance of buffet, of the stick shaker and of the stall warning and with the non-automatic disengagement of the autopilot after the stall warning. [MLI-2016-003] and [FRAN-2016-024]. that the FAA and EASA require that (the specific features of a stall in cruise) on MD 80 type aeroplanes (should) be taught during type rating and recurrent crew training. [MLI-2016-004] and [MLI-2016-005]; [FRAN-2016-025] and [FRAN-2016-026]. that the FAA ensure that the data made available by the manufacturer Boeing for the design of MD80 simulators be representative in respect of the triggering of approach to stall warnings and the non-disengagement of the autopilot after the stall, at low altitude and at cruise level. [MLI-2016-006] and [FRAN-2016-027]. that the FAA and EASA ensure the simulators used for training MD80 crews (are) representative of the triggering of approach to stall warnings, and the non-disengagement of the autopilot after the stall, at low altitude and at cruise level. [MLI-2016-007] and [MLI-2016-008]; [FRAN-2016-028] and [FRAN-2016-029]. that the FAA require that the manufacturer Boeing studies the feasibility of a modification of the autopilot's engagement logic to allow automatic disengagement when the approach to stall is detected by the MD80 systems. [MLI-2016-009] and [FRAN-2016-030]. that the FAA ensure that the maintenance check procedure for CVRs on MD80
