On 3 February 2018, an Airbus A320 (EI-CVB) being operated by Aer Lingus on a scheduled international passenger flight from Lyon to London Gatwick had just landed on runway 26L and was decelerating through approximately 60 knots when the crew saw a vehicle enter the runway and drive towards them. They were approaching the rapid exit taxiway (RET) on which they expected to leave the runway and did so and were followed onto the same taxiway by the vehicle. The Captain advised his intention to submit a Safety Report.
