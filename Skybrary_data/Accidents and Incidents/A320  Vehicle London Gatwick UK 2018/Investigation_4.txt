observed that whilst the annual CAA audit “did identify and address relevant issues relating to ATC and runway inspections, the latter were identified only after the investigated incident had occurred (and that) it remains important to ensure individual airport Inspector workload is commensurate with providing adequate oversight of a major complex airport”. The way in which the various parties within the airport operator and the ANSP dealt with runway safety issues and in particular the runway incursion risk was examined by the Investigation in some detail. One finding was that ATC management seemed to think that at least pilots based at Gatwick (the Aer Lingus crew involved in the event under investigation were not) would be “aware of runway inspection procedures” whereas this was confirmed by senior pilot managers from two Gatwick-based airlines to be wrong. These managers also stated that “they would not consider it acceptable for vehicles to enter a runway ahead of an aircraft until the aircraft was physically vacating the runway (and) pointed out that although a crew may have nominated the exit they would be using and may appear to be turning off the runway, they may (still) choose to continue past the exit at any time due to a technical failure or operational issue”. The assembled evidence on runway inspections which had to be carried out in a demanding operational environment was considered to indicate “a lack of understanding” of how the airport operator and ANSPs work impacted airport users and “had potentially normalised procedures that would otherwise have been considered undesirable or at worst unacceptable”. Both organisations’ internal investigations of the 3 February 2018 event had been “triggered by the pilot declaring his intention to file a safety report” and both “saw nothing wrong in what happened” in direct contrast to the opinions of both the airline involved and other airline operators. The ATC report considered that the aircraft had been “committed” to vacating at the intended RET but failed to consider the fact “the aircraft appeared to be still on the centreline at the time the instructions were issued to the operations vehicle, the speed of the aircraft, the wet state of the runway and the implications had the aircraft, for whatever reason, needed to continue on the runway past the RET”. It was noted too that “there was also no apparent understanding of the potential distraction caused by asking the crew questions at a time of high workload”. It was considered that the assumption by the controller involved - which was supported by ANSP management - that the landing aircraft had been re-cleared to proceed no further than the second RET was “not clearly in accordance with any recognised ATC procedure”. It was noted that a new runway inspection SOP became operational in January 2019 but that “it still does not include details on the direction (in which) runway inspections are to be performed (and) also requires lighting inspections to be done with the driver looking forward and the additional vehicle
