occupant having to look behind the vehicle”. This new SOP also now includes a requirement that “vehicles should not enter the runway ahead of a landing aircraft until the aircraft has fully committed to the exit” but does not say that this is irrespective of any ATC clearance issued and fails to define what “fully committed to the exit” actually means. The formally documented Conclusion of the Investigation was as follows: Gatwick Airport operates at high intensity to maximise the use of its single runway. This demands that airport operations, ATC and aircraft all operate as efficiently as possible if the declared runway capacity is to be attained. This capacity is not imposed but is set by the airport itself. In setting the capacity it is important to balance maximising the number of aircraft operating to the airport with the safety of the operation itself. This Investigation indicates that the pressure of meeting the operating targets has had a direct effect on undertaking runway inspections both safely and effectively. Many of the measures taken to redress the issues outlined in this report have yet to be completed and continued oversight and regular reviews in this area at all levels should be maintained. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Air Navigation Solutions Ltd amend the wording of the Gatwick Airport Manual of Air Traffic Services Part 2, Chapter 10 and Supplementary Instruction 021 to specify how an aircraft is determined to have fully committed to vacating the runway, and ensure a vehicle cannot be cleared onto the runway ahead of an aircraft until the aircraft has done so.
