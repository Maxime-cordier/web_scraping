First Officer after the ARFS had been asked to re-check the aft cargo area externally, the controller stated that everything was normal. It is unclear if the controller had been told this by the ARFS but it seems that the First Officer may have assumed that he had and therefore, without consulting the Captain, replied in the affirmative when the controller then asked the crew to “report emergency terminated”. It was considered fortuitous that the Captain had then immediately intervened to request that the ARFS remain in position to provide fire cover until everyone on board had disembarked and the suspect hold had been properly examined. This level of caution should always be applied to such a decision.. A total of four Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Singapore Airlines consider requiring its flight crews to inform air traffic controllers on the details and locations of dangerous goods on board once a smoke or fire related emergency is declared. [R-2015-001]. that Singapore Airlines remind its flight crews that they should not consider that a fire risk has been contained, mitigated or removed, unless they have received the relevant input from the aircraft rescue and fire-fighting authority and satisfied themselves that the aircraft rescue and fire-fighting authority has performed the necessary checks. [R-2015-002]. that Bangkok Airport Control Tower remind its air traffic controllers that it may be preferable to obtain information pertaining to the fire emergency management (e.g. fire risk, status of fire-fighting operation) from the ARFS rather than from the flight crew of the aircraft concerned. [R-2015-003]. that the Bangkok Airport Authority considers implementing an arrangement whereby, in an emergency, the ARFS could communicate directly with the flight crew of the aircraft concerned, instead of communicating through the air traffic controllers. [R-2015-004]. The Final Report was published on 2 July 2015.
