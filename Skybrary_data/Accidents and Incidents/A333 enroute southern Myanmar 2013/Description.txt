On 22 April 2013, an Airbus A330-300 (9V-STO) being operated by Singapore Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Singapore to Dhaka as SQ446 was almost 1Â½ hours into the flight and in the cruise at FL360 at night when just after entering Myanmar airspace, an ECAM Warning of SMOKE in one of the lower deck holds was annunciated. Although the corresponding checklist action was taken, the warning remained and so a MAYDAY was declared and a diversion to Bangkok made without further airborne problems. Once all passengers had disembarked and the hold involved was opened, large quantities of smoke appeared and despite RFFS, intervention, a significant fire subsequently erupted in the hold before being extinguished. There were no injuries but the aircraft compartment involved was damaged and a cargo container which had been at the centre of the fire and some of its contents were destroyed.
