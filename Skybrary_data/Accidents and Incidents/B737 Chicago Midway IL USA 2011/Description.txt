On 26 April 2011 a Boeing 737-700 being operated by Southwest AL on a scheduled passenger flight from Denver to Chicago Oâ€™Hare failed to stop within the paved area of runway 13C at alternate Chicago Midway in normal ground visibility and finally stopped just under 70 metres from the end of the runway in grass to the left side of the installed Engineered Materials Arresting System. The aircraft incurred only minor damage and none of the 139 occupants were injured. Passengers were eventually disembarked using steps and bussed to the Terminal.
