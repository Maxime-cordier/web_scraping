MH17, most operators, not just MAS, had continued to do so. After a very complex and detailed analysis, it was concluded that "the combination of the recorded pressure wave, the damage pattern found on the wreckage caused by blast and the impact of fragments, the bow-tie shaped fragments found in the cockpit and in the body of one of the crew members in the cockpit, the injuries sustained by three crew members in the cockpit, the analysis of the in-flight break-up, the analysis of the explosive residues and paint found, and the size and distinct, bow-tie, shape of some the fragments" showed that the aircraft had been struck by a 70 kg 9N314M warhead of the type carried by a 9M38-series missile and launched by a BUK surface-to-air missile system. The assembled evidence and rigorous simulations indicated that the detonation of this warhead had occurred about four metres above the tip of the nose of the aircraft to the left of the flight deck. There was no evidence of any conscious actions being performed by the occupants of the aircraft after the detonation of the missile and it was considered likely that they would have been "barely able to comprehend the situation in which they found themselves". A total of 11 Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation in respect of three matters - Airspace management in conflict zones (1-3), Risk Assessment (4-9) and Operator accountability (10-11) as follows: that the ICAO should incorporate in Standards that States dealing with an armed conflict in their territory shall at an early stage publish information that is as specific as possible regarding the nature and extent of threats of that conflict and its consequences for civil aviation, providing clear definitions of relevant terms, such as conflict zone and armed conflict.. that the ICAO should ask States dealing with an armed conflict for additional information if published aeronautical or other publications give cause to do so and offer assistance and consider issuing a State Letter if, in the opinion of ICAO, (such) States do not sufficiently fulfil their responsibility for the safety of the airspace for civil aviation.. that the ICAO should update Standards and Recommended Practices related to the consequences of armed conflicts for civil aviation and convert the relevant Recommended Practices into Standards as much as possible so that States will be able to take unambiguous measures if the safety of civil aviation may be at issue.. that ICAO Member States should ensure that Statesâ€™ responsibilities related to the safety of their airspace are (strictly) defined in the Chicago Convention and the underlying Standards and Recommended Practices, so that it is clear in which cases airspace should be closed. (The publication of this Recommendation was accompanied by a Note which says that "the States most closely involved in the investigation into the crash of flight MH17 could initiate this".). that the ICAO and the IATA should encourage States and Operators who have relevant information about threats within foreign
