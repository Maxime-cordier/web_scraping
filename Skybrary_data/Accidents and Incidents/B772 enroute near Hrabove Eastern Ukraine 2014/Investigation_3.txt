airspace to make this available in a timely manner to others who have an interest in it in connection with aviation safety and ensure that the relevant paragraphs in the ICAO Annexes concerned are extended and made more strict.. that the ICAO should amend relevant Standards so that risk assessments also cover threats to civil aviation in the airspace at cruising level, especially when overflying conflict zones. Factors which increase risk and/or uncertainty need to be included in these risk assessments in accordance with the proposals made by the ICAO Working Group on Threat and Risk.. that the IATA should ensure that the (ICAO) Standards regarding risk assessment are also reflected in IATA Operational Safety Audits (IOSA).. that States (in their capacity as States of an Operator) should ensure that Operators are required through national regulations to make risk assessments of overflying conflict zones which include factors that increase risk and/or uncertainty in accordance with the proposals made by the ICAO Working Group on Threat and Risk.. that the ICAO and the IATA should, in addition to actions already taken, such as the website with notifications about conflict zones (ICAO Conflict Zone Information Repository), initiate a platform for exchanging experiences and good practices regarding assessing the risks related to the overflying of conflict zones.. that the IATA should ensure that their member airlines agree on how to publish clear information to potential passengers about flight routes over conflict zones and on making operators accountable for that information.. that Operators should provide public accountability for flight routes chosen, at least once a year.. A Preliminary Report on the initial progress of the Investigation was published on 9 September 2014 and the Final Report was published on 13 October 2015 along with a series of Appendices (A-Z) which, if required, may be consulted using the links provided on the Dutch TSB website.
