crew member left her jump seat before the final turn onto the parking stand and before the Flight Crew announced: “Cabin Crew, Prepare all doors and cross check””. A Contributing Factor was determined to have been “the sudden firm braking action which caused the cabin crew member to lose her balance and fall”. Three Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Emirates Airline should assess the risk to female cabin crewmembers of wearing high/medium heeled shoes during the critical phases of the flight (taxi, take-off, climb, descent and landing). [SR19/2016]. that Emirates Airline should, to eliminate the risk of cabin crewmembers walking long distances during taxi, give consideration to monitoring the revised door checker SOP that was published on the 16 October 2014 for consistent application. [SR20/2016]. that Emirates Airline should consider monitoring the existing procedure of cabin crew leaving their jump seats to disarm their door before the final turn and upon the flight crew PA for consistent application. [SR21/2016]. The Final Report of the Investigation was issued on 3 March 2016.
