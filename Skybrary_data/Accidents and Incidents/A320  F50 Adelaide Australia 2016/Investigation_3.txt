was observed that "this anomaly in the controller's technique resulted in a number of clipped pilot transmissions due to them starting the readback whilst the foot PTT was still engaged". This controller's error was reported to have been "rectified by using the in-line PTT which decreased the delay of the controller releasing the foot PTT". The Investigation commented that: The A320 crew were "to be commended for their actions in preventing a potentially more serious incident occurring".. The F50 crew probably thought they were cleared to cross the runway because of the bay allocation added at the end of the hold short instruction - although an effective sighting of the approach A320 "may have led them to query their understood instruction to cross the runway".. The GND controller did not hear the full response of the F50 crew to his initial "Hold Short" instruction and having "mis-heard" the word "short" instead of the word "cross" actually transmitted, he had then "assumed" that the word ‘hold’ had been clipped from the transmission.. The TWR controller had commenced position handover when the A320 was on very short finals and as a consequence had ceased watching both it and the runway as they "assumed that the F50 would hold short and that the runway was clear".. It was considered that effective communication serves to minimise the risk of runway incursions and that the investigated event had highlighted the importance of: controllers and flight crews using correct phraseology. controllers and pilots challenging instructions which they have not heard or understood fully. pilots looking carefully for aircraft or other hazards before entering an active runway.. The Final Report was published on 22 November 2016. No Safety Recommendations were made.
