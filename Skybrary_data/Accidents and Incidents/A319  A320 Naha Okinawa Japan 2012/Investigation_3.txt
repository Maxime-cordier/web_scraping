included the transmissions made by the TWR controller involved was found to include "pop noise (noise occurring when sound is cracked by excessive strength of the voice or by blowing into a microphone)" which primarily occurred in the case of consonant sounds and had been "particularly prominent" in the case of the 'hold short' portion of the misunderstood transmission in which the A319 had been instructed to hold short of the runway. The recording of the beginning of the readback was "very difficult to read". In addition, it was found that immediately after the hold instruction from TWR to the A319 had been completed, another aircraft which had been instructed on the GND frequency to taxi to the runway, began to read back its instruction and with the control room loud speakers on, the beginning of the readback from the A319 overlapped with the end of the this GND frequency readback "for about 1.2 seconds". It was concluded that "pop noise" was likely to have "been involved in the mishearing" of the TWR controller's 'hold short' instruction. It was noted that "the recorded sound of the Controllerâ€™s voice was derived from the signal at the stage where it was output from a control console to a transmitter and was not from the signal which had been transmitted and then received" so it was not necessarily of the same quality as the sound heard in the aircraft. The failure of the TWR controller to wear her headset as intended by its manufacturer was considered to be the primary reason for both the lack of clarity in her 'hold short' transmission to the A319 and (because of the short overlap of the GND and TWR aircraft readbacks) of her failure to recognise the unclear readback of that clearance. It was concluded that effective communications required that controllers wear their headsets at all times when in position. A slight delay in the TWR controller seeing that a runway incursion had occurred was attributed to her line of sight being briefly obscured by a taxiing Boeing 777. The Probable Cause of the Serious Incident was determined as "the departing [A319] aircraft made an incursion onto the runway despite being instructed to hold short of the runway, causing the arriving [A320] aircraft, which had already been cleared to land, to attempt to land on the same runway" and that "the departing aircraft entered the runway because its flight crew misheard and misunderstood the instruction to hold short of the runway as an instruction to hold on the runway and did not notice the aircraft on approach and also because the Tower Controller did not recognise that the readback from the departing aircraft was incorrect and consequently did not confirm or correct it". It was also found that the following Contributory Factors were "somewhat likely": Noise occurring in the sound of the hold instruction from the Tower Controller contributed to the mishearing of the hold instruction by the flight crew and their misunderstanding that they were
