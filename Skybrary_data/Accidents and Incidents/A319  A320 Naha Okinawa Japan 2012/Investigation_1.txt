An Investigation was carried out by the Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB). The DFDR data from both aircraft and ATC recordings of radar and radio communications were used to help establish the factual basis for the Investigation. It was found that relevant data from the 2 hour CVRs from both aircraft had been overwritten. The data from an MLAT system which had been under "operational evaluation" at the time of the incursion was also available. It was found that the A319 was being operated by a flight crew consisting of a Training Captain occupying the right hand seat in command and a First Officer, who was in the process of qualifying for command and under supervision for that purpose and acting as PF, occupying the left hand seat. The 47 year-old male Captain had accumulated 11,581 flying hours which included 10,434 hours on type. The 28 year-old male trainee Captain had accumulated 4,948 total flying hours which included 4,698 hours on type. This operating crew were accompanied by a third pilot occupying the supernumerary flight deck crew seat and who "was responsible for ATC radio communication". This pilot was a First Officer who had 1,071 hours total flight time of which 821 hours were on type. The 44 year-old male A320 Captain had 9,519 hours total flying experience which included 127 hours on type. The 47 year-old male First Officer on the A320 had 11,252 total flying hours which included 4,760 hours on type. All 5 pilots held Level 4 English Language Proficiency Certificates. The 39 year-old female TWR Controller had an ATC English Language Proficiency Certificate indicating competency at or above ICAO Level 4. It was noted that the TWR controller's position was located approximately 1,680 metres from the runway access where the incursion occurred (see below) and that visibility was good. The A320 flight was being observed by a Company Check Pilot and an Operations Inspector from the Japan CAB travelling in the flight deck. It was established that GND had cleared the A319 to taxi to the runway 18 holding point and then, as it approached the limit of its clearance, had transferred it to TWR. By this time, TWR had already cleared the A320 to land on runway 18 and received the corresponding readback. The A319 checked in with TWR as it entered the assigned runway access taxiway E0 (see the diagram) and was instructed to "hold short of runway 18, report ready". The readback from the aircraft which followed was “(unintelligible sound) runway 18, report ready.” At this point, the A320 was on final approach at about 3.5 nm out at an altitude of 1,000 feet. The A319 braked slightly which reduced its groundspeed to less than 10 knots (the First Officer subsequently stated that this had been so as to complete the 'Before Take Off Checks' prior to entering the runway) but it continued moving forward and eventually crossed the runway holding point. As it did so, the A320 was about 2.7 nm out
