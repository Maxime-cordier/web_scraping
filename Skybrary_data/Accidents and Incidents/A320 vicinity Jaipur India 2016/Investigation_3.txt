runway had centreline marking in addition to threshold, TDZ and edge markings.. The Cause of the Serious Incident was determined as "the Captain misidentifying a road parallel to and short of the runway as the runway and his failure to order a go-around despite the First Officer (PF) saying, more than once, that (the Captain was not looking at the runway)‚Äù. Four Contributory Factors were also identified as follows: The crew decision to carry out a visual approach to runway 27, knowing that the setting sun would impair their visibility.. The failure of crew to use ILS as a back-up while doing the visual approach, especially with the sun into their eyes.. Both pilots were operating to Jaipur after a long gap.. A lack of assertiveness on the part of the First Officer even when he did not have runway in sight and a non-receptive Captain when he did.. The Final Report was completed on 8 January 2019 and subsequently released during February 2020.
