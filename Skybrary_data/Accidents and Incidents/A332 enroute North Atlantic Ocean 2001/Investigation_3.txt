post-SB configuration and the company personnel had never been involved with pre-SB configured engines”. It was also noted that the physical appearance of the pre-SB and post-SB hydraulic pump configurations were similar and no difference would be visible during a cursory inspection such as that conducted at engine receipt and that the part number of the hydraulic pump fitted was incorrectly identified as a post-SB one with the same Part Number as those installed on other Company A330s. The short notice of the plan to use the loan engine to replace one of those on the accident aircraft meant that job cards generated by maintenance planning were those associated with a normal engine change and this ensured that “the responsibility to detect the incompatibility between the hydraulic pump and the fuel and hydraulic lines was deferred to the technicians doing the engine change”. Once the installation of the loan engine was in progress, interference was noticed between the hydraulic pump and the fuel tube. At this stage, it was realised that the difficulty with the hydraulic pump installation could be related to the differing SB status but upon encountering problems in looking into this, the lead technician involved sought engineering guidance via maintenance control but this did not resolve the issue and when he contacted the Engine Controller, the latter’s “knowledge of the SB and its background comforted the lead technician into feeling that the Engine Controller had a good grasp of the problem at hand” led to acceptance of their inappropriate (and unsubstantiated by documentation) guidance. It appeared that “adequate clearance between the fuel and hydraulic lines” had been achieved during installation of the hydraulic pump line “by applying some force to position the line and holding the line while applying torque to the (securing) nut". The Investigation noted that although it was not unusual to position a line to achieve clearances in this manner, if clamping is not used then there is a tendency for a flexible line to straighten when pressurised in operation, which was particularly critical when there is a 90º bend in the tube adjacent to a securing nut as in this case. It was considered that “the risk associated with the application of force while installing mixed construction lines is not well known in the maintenance community” and noted that it was “not covered in the training of maintenance technicians”. In this case, it was apparent that “pressurisation of the hydraulic line would have been sufficient to cause the hydraulic line to move back to its natural position and come in contact with the fuel line” causing chafing and the eventual failure of the fuel line in flight. The failure of both Quality Control and Quality Assurance processes to function effectively as a defence against improper maintenance practices was noted, as was the absence of any airworthiness requirement to review all SB’s on a component prior to its installation and checking for compatibility. The Operational Failure The Investigation determined that the prelude - and
