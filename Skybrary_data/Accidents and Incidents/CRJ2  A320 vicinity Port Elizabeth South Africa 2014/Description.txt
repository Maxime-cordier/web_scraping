On 10 July 2014, a Bombardier CRJ-200 (ZS-NMF) being operated by SA Express on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Durban to Port Elizabeth as EXY336 was making a day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) missed approach from runway 26 when it had to take avoiding action against an Airbus A320 (ZS-SZZ). The other aircraft was being operated by South African Airways on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg as SAA 410 and had just taken off from the same runway.
