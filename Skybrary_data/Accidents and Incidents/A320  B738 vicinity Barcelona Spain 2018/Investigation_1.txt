A Serious Incident Investigation was carried out by the Spanish Commission for the Investigation of Accidents and Incidents (CIAIAC). It relied on recorded ATC data which were considered adequate without also seeking aircraft flight data. It was noted that the A320 crew had consisted of a 37 year-old Captain and a 30 year-old First Officer and that the 737 crew had consisted of a 51 year-old Captain and a 32 year-old First Officer. It was further noted that the 44 year-old Executive Controller covering the sector where the conflict occurred at that time had been “trained on both the new Barcelona TMA, where RNAV flight paths had recently been implemented to replace conventional flight paths and on potential incidents in the TMA as a result of the introduction of these new flight paths”. It was found that new RNAV arrival procedures covering all 07L/R approaches had been in effect for just over two months at the time of the investigated event. It was established that both aircraft were being positioned onto the same RNAV Transition for an approach to runway 07L, the A320 coming from the ‘VIBIM’ holding pattern and cleared direct to waypoint BL542 and the 737 coming from the ‘RUBOT’ holding pattern and cleared intially to waypoint BL 546 (see the illustration below). Both aircraft were at this stage in contact with the controller of Barcelona sector T3E with the A320 cleared to descend to 4000 feet QNH and the 737 to 5000 feet. The 737’s ground speed was 30 knots greater than that of the A320 which was 220 knots. With the A320 still some way from BL542, it was cleared to continue to 3000 feet QNH and although still in the T3E sector was transferred to the Final (F07) Controller. The controller in the T3E position the handed over the position to a colleague who he briefed on all traffic currently on the frequency. The workload at the time of the changeover was not high - the oncoming controller subsequently described the traffic situation as “simple” - but the handover briefing did not mention the A320 still proceeding to BL546 and still in the sector (and visible on radar) but no longer on the sector frequency. With the 737 passing 6,900 feet QNH and with a groundspeed now 50 knots greater than the A320, which was passing 6,100 feet, the new T3E controller then re-cleared the 737 to descend to 4000 feet. As the 737 (and the A320) passed 5000 feet, the 737 was re-cleared to waypoint BL542 (which the A320 had still not reached). Approximately 1½ minutes later, the A320 was close to BL 542 and about to turn left and descend to 3000 feet as cleared by the Final (F07) controller and the 737 had now turned left from BL546 towards BL542 and was descending to 4000 feet. At this time, both aircraft were passing 5000 feet and the groundspeed of the 737 had slightly reduced to 260 knots whilst that of the A320
