environment was covered over a 3-year period and that “the use of emergency and safety equipment in a smoke environment should therefore be scheduled more frequently during simulator training”. Finally, it was also found that the cabin crew had not properly executed their Fire Drill Checklist as detailed in their Safety & Emergency (SEP) Manual which was noted to state that “in the event of a lot of smoke in the cabin, passengers should be relocated (as necessary) and given wet cloth to breathe through”. The cabin crew’s distribution of dry serviette paper to cover their nose and mouth was considered to have “exposed the passengers to a high risk of irritation and suffocation”. The Cause of the Serious Incident was determined as “engine oil leaking onto the hot surfaces of the engine No. 2 due to a failed seal which produced fumes that mixed with the bleed air supply to the air conditioning system and resulted in smoke in the aircraft flight deck and cabin”. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Arik Air Nigeria should ensure that flight crew execute appropriate checklist items completely in line with the aircraft FCOM and QRH. [2021-028]. that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority should ensure that flight crew type-rated on the Bombardier DHC-8-Q400 should undergo further training on “The effects of smoke in an enclosed area and actual use of relevant equipment in a simulated smoke environment”. [2021-029]. It was noted that a further relevant Safety Recommendation had been made after an almost identical event involving another operator’s DHC8-400 had occurred in 2017 as follows: that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) should ensure that operators utilise the ‘New Oil Analysis Technology’ made available by Pratt & Whitney Canada in order to identify impending failure of the carbon seals on PW150A engines that do not to comply with SB 35342R1. [2019-25]. The current Investigation recorded the fact that on 19 December 2019, the NCAA had responded to this recommendation by advising the AIB that since the 2018 event, Arik Air had actioned SB35342 - as issued by Pratt & Whitney in 2016 but subsequently updated to SB35342R1 in 2018 - on 4 of their 6 DHC8-400 PW150A engines and were also “in the process of” amending their DHC8-400 Aircraft Maintenance Programme to include the proactive procedures of the new 'Oil Analysis Technology Programme' for all engines. It was noted that one of the engines on 5N-BKX had been modified in accordance with SB35342R1 at the time of writing but that the other was one of the two awaiting this modification. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 8 July 2021.
