On 23 January 2020, a Bombardier CRJ700 (F-GRZL) being operated by Air France subsidiary ‘HOP!’ on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Lille to Lyon Saint-Exupéry was mismanaged during a HUD-supported manual Cat 3a ILS approach at destination conducted in night IMC and the initiation of the low go around was also not in accordance with the applicable procedures. However, the climb away was eventually made and a second approach was subsequently completed without further event.
