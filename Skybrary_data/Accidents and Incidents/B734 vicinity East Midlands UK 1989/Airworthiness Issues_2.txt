that the No.1 engine fire warning which had begun 36 seconds before ground impact, had been initiated by a secondary fire on the outboard exterior of the engine fan casing and that this had been caused by the effects of prolonged running of the engine with excessive vibration. This would have probably loosened fuel/oil system unions and seals on the exterior of the fan casing and, in conjunction with damage to the engine inlet ducting by fan blade debris, would have been sufficient to lead to the “ignition of atomised fuel/oil sprays by titanium 'sparks' and/or intake flame”. Finally on the airworthiness front, it was concluded that the root cause of the initial fan blade failure was a fatigue fracture which had been initiated “as a result of exposure of the blade to a vibratory stress level greater than that for which it was designed, due to the existence of a fan system vibratory mode, induced under conditions of high corrected fan speed at altitude, which was not detected by engine certification testing”.
