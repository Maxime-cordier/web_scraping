confirmation bias, to continue the descent below the decision altitude when the runway had not been positively identified”. Two Contributory Factors to the accident were identified as: the First Officer’s fatigue, which exacerbated his confirmation bias,. the failure of CommutAir pilots who had previously observed the localiser misalignment to report it to their company and to air traffic control before the accident.. Safety Action taken by the FAA as a result of the accident was noted as including the issue of a revised AC 150/5200-30D which incorporated additional guidance for airport operators about snow removal around navigational aids. This specifically added advice in respect of the previously ignored ILS LOC to the effect that “the accumulation of large amounts of snow can change the surface area in front of the Localizer and consequentially may affect its radiated signal”. It also introduced a snow depth of 2 feet (60cm) as the trigger for an FAA ILS system specialist to start observing the condition of the LOC signal and a requirement to issue a NOTAM “when a determination is made that snow or ice accumulations jeopardise signal strength from the LOC or GS transmitters”. The Final Report was published on 12 July 2022. No Safety Recommendations were made.
