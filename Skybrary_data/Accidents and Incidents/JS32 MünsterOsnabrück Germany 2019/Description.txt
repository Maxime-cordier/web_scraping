On 8 October 2019, a BAe Jetstream 32 (PH-RCI) being operated by AIS Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Münster/Osnabrück to Stuttgart as W2-6505 which was being used for line training made a rejected takeoff from significantly above the applicable V1 in day VMC after it was impossible to rotate the aircraft. An excursion off the side of the runway then occurred and another aircraft waiting at a holding point was just avoided before the runway was regained. Damage to the aircraft and to ground lighting/signage was relatively minor and there were no injuries to the three crew or the only passenger.
