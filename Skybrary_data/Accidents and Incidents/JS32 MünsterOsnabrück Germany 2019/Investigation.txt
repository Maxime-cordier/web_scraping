An Investigation was carried out by the German Federal Bureau of Accident Investigation (BFU). The CVR and FDR were both removed from the aircraft and their relevant data were successfully downloaded. It was noted that the 63 year-old Captain held a Dutch licence which included a limitation that it was valid only when with or as a copilot. He had a total 8,860 hours flying experience of which 767 hours were on type but most of the remainder had been obtained during light aircraft training flights as a flying instructor. The 26 year-old First Officer held a French licence issued in February 2019 and was a French national with a licence endorsement for level 5 English. He had a total of 157 hours flying experience of which just 47 minutes were on type, obtained during early July 2019 whilst undergoing training for a Jetstream 32 type rating which had otherwise all been conducted in a full flight simulator. Over three months had elapsed since his only previous flight in the aircraft type.
