On 18 June 2013, a Boeing 737-800 (VH-VYK) being operated by Qantas Airways on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Sydney to Adelaide as Qantas 735 with 152 persons on board was unable to land at its destination due to a deterioration in the weather there. Upon diversion to its designated alternate, Mildura, the weather had deteriorated but there was insufficient fuel to go anywhere else and so the only available (non precision) approach was continued below the MDA by 240 feet until the runway was visually acquired in day IMC on emerging from cloud at a reported 150 feet agl.
