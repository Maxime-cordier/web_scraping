On 21 August 2010, an ATR72-200 being operated by Golden Air Flyg on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Visby to Stockholm Bromma in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) was radar vectored close to some parachutists approximately 4nm east-south-east of the airport which had just been dropped from a Visual Flight Rules (VFR) helicopter as part of an air show. The proximity was reported by a concerned ground observer.
