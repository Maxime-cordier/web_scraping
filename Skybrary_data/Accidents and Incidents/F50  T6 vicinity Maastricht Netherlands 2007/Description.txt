On 2 August 2007, a Fokker F50 (PH-KVC) being operated by KLM Cityhopper on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Amsterdam to Maastricht and making a daylight ILS approach in IMC came into close proximity with a privately operated North American T6J Harvard (D-FUUK) on VFR flight from Aachen Merzbr√ºck, Germany to Duxford, UK without either aircraft seeing the other. The Harvard was transiting the zone en route under a Special VFR clearance.
