On 15 July 2018, an Airbus 220-300 (HB-JCC) being operated by Swiss International Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Porto to Geneva as LX 2077 failed to get airborne in normal visibility at night until much nearer the end of the runway than should have been the case, after it was realised that the thrust initially set for takeoff was insufficient and it had been increased accordingly. The remainder of the flight was without further event.
