Causal Factors were formally stated as follows (quoted verbatim): The commander landed with a reported tailwind of 15 kt which was outside the aircraft maximum tailwind limit of 10 kt specified in the Cessna 550 Flight Manual.. The co-pilot did not warn the commander that he was landing with a reported tailwind component which was outside the aircraft limit.. With a tailwind component of 10 kt, the landing distance available was less than the landing distance required..
