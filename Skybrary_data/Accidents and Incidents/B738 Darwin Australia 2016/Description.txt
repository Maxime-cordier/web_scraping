On 6 December 2016, a Virgin Australia Airlines Boeing 737-800 (VH-VUI) being operated on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Melbourne to Darwin departed the side of the 60 metre-wide 3354 metres long destination runway 29 at night after a ILS Category 1 approach in night VMC when shortly before landing, the previously good visibility had been suddenly reduced in very heavy rain. A drift away from the unlit runway centreline thereafter went undetected and the crew did not realise that the aircraft had left the paved surface soon after touchdown. Inspection of the aircraft on its parking gate after engine shut down found all right main gear tyres had sustained significant damage. After TC had been advised of this, six runway edge lights were found to have been destroyed leaving associated debris on and near the runway edge.
