fully assess a pilotâ€™s entire training performance.. [A-10-17] that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) require 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121, 135, and 91K operators to include the training records requested in Safety Recommendation A-10-17 as part of the remedial training program requested in Safety Recommendation A-05-14.. [A-10-18] that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) require 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121, 135, and 91K operators to provide the training records requested in Safety Recommendation A-10-17 to hiring employers to fulfill their requirement under the Pilot Records Improvement Act.. [A-10-19] that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) develop a process for verifying, validating, auditing, and amending pilot training records at 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121, 135, and 91K operators to guarantee the accuracy and completeness of the records.. [A-10-20] that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) direct 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121, 135, and 91K operators of airplanes equipped with a reference speeds switch or similar device to:. develop procedures to establish that, during approach and landing, airspeed reference bugs are always matched to the position of the switch and. implement specific training to ensure that pilots demonstrate proficiency in this area.. [A-10-21] that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) require 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121, 135, and 91K operators and 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 142 training centres to develop and conduct training that incorporates stalls that are fully developed; are unexpected; involve autopilot disengagement; and include airplane-specific features, such as a reference speeds switch.. [A-10-22] that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) require all 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121, 135, and 91K operators of stick pusher-equipped aircraft to provide their pilots with pusher familiarisation simulator training.. [A-10-23] that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) define and codify minimum simulator model fidelity requirements to support an expanded set of stall recovery training requirements, including recovery from stalls that are fully developed. These simulator fidelity requirements should address areas such as required angle-of-attack and sideslip angle ranges, motion cueing, proof-of-match with post-stall flight test data, and warnings to indicate when the simulator flight envelope has been exceeded.. [A-10-24] that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identify which airplanes operated under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121, 135, and 91K are susceptible to tailplane stalls and then:. require operators of those airplanes to provide an appropriate aircraft-specific tailplane stall recovery procedure in their training manuals and company procedures and. direct operators of those airplanes that are not susceptible to tailplane stalls to ensure that training and company guidance for the airplanes explicitly states this lack of susceptibility and contains no references to tailplane stall recovery procedures.. [A-10-25] that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) develop more stringent standards for surveillance of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 135, and 91K operators that are experiencing rapid growth, increased complexity of operations, accidents and/or incidents, or other changes that warrant increased oversight, including the following:. verify that inspector staffing is adequate to accomplish the enhanced surveillance that
