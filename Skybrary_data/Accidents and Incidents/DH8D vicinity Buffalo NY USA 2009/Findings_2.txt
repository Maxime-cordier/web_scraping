these changes will be appropriately mitigated.. Mandatory flight operational quality assurance programs would enhance flight safety because all operators would have readily available data to identify operational risks and use in developing corrective actions.. The NTSB determined that the Probable Cause of the accident was "the Captain’s inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover". Four Contributory Factors were also identified: the flight crew’s failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low speed cue,. the flight crew’s failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures,. the captain’s failure to effectively manage the flight, and. Colgan Air’s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.".
