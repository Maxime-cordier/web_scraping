On 8 July 2018, a Boeing 737-800 (B18667) being operated by China Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Taipei Taoyuan to Toyama, Japan as CI170 was unable to land at destination despite three attempts to do so and diverted to the designated alternate, Chubu. During this diversion, crew concern at fuel endurance in relation to final reserve fuel led to declaration of PAN and then MAYDAY status which after temporary communication difficulties were resolved and the diversion was completed without further event.
