that the potential risk to operational safety arising from continuing with the planned approach and landing was acceptable.. The maintenance of a significantly higher VAPP than usual.. The conviction of the commander as PF that his considerable experience as a pilot both generally and specific to the ATR72 would enable him to make a safe landing despite the presence of potentially difficult wind conditions for the aircraft type.. The significant experience gap between the Captain and the First Officer which effectively inhibited the latter from showing their critical capacity, thus making CRM techniques ineffective.. Two Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that ENAC and the National Fire Brigade take, as a matter of urgency, the initiatives deemed most appropriate in terms of training and ensure that fire brigade personnel based at Italian airports have a fully effective knowledge of both aeronautical and aerodrome terminology so as to avoid misunderstandings in communication relating to rescue operations and thereby aid the timely identification of any aircraft in need of rescue services. [ANSV-4/132-13/1/A/13] (Note: This Safety Recommendation is in line with what has already been recommended by the ANSV in Safety Recommendation ANSV-13/1836-10/5/A/12). that ENAC and ENAV ensure that where an ATC TWR is equipped with indications to assist with the activation of rescue operations, it is also possible to communicate locations based on a GRID-MAP of the airport to the emergency services. [ANSV-5/132-13/2/A/13]. The Final Report was published on 4 December 2015 only in the Italian language and no official English language translation has since been forthcoming. This summary article has been prepared using an unofficial and unpublished translation which is not available but is believed to have facilitated an accurate depiction of the accident and the subsequent independent investigation of it.
