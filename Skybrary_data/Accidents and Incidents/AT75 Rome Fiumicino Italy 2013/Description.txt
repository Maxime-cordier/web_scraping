On 2 February 2013, the crew of an ATR 72-500 (YR-ATS) being operated by Carpatair under contract to Alitalia on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Pisa to Rome Fiumicino as AZ1670 lost control of their aircraft during a crosswind landing on runway16L at destination after making a stable ILS approach in night VMC. A series of four bounces resulted in failure of the landing gear and the departure of the aircraft from the runway before it came to a stop 30 metres from it facing the direction of the approach. Seven of the 50 occupants sustained minor injuries but the very significant damage to the aircraft made it an automatic hull loss. The aircraft in its final stopping position.
