On 3 August 2016, a Rolls Royce Trent 892-powered Boeing 777-300 (A6-EMW) being operated by Emirates on a scheduled international passenger flight from Trivandrum, India to Dubai as EK 521 commenced a go around shortly after touchdown on runway 12L at destination in day VMC but almost immediately sank back onto the runway and veered to the right towards its end before stopping. All 300 occupants escaped but four of the cabin crew were seriously injured and 21 passengers, 6 cabin crew and one of the pilots sustained minor injuries. The aircraft was completely destroyed by a combination of impact damage and the fire which developed quickly thereafter and eventually culminated in an explosion. This explosion occurred after the evacuation of all 282 passengers and most of the 18 crew had been completed. One fire fighter was killed, and five others and two police officers sustained minor injuries at the crash site. Damage was caused to the runway surface and to manoeuvring area lighting and signage.
