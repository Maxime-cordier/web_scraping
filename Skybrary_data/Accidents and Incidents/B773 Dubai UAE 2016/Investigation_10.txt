go-around and missed approach training standards which should include simulated scenarios for a normal go-around initiated close to the runway and after touchdown when the takeoff/go-around (TO/GA) switches are inhibited. This should also include information on engine response time to achieve go-around thrust. [SR02/2020]. that Emirates enhance training standards regarding TO/GA switch inhibiting so that pilots are aware of the effect on FMA annunciations and the flight director, and the availability of the autothrottle after the aircraft becomes airborne during a go-around. [SR03/2020]. that Emirates enhance the flight crew training and assessment system to include procedures for managing evaluator comments on pilot performance including pilots who have met the competency standard. [SR04/2020]. that Emirates review and enhance the go-around training standards taking into consideration the available analytical flight monitoring data as well as the recommendations made within the industry. For example, the recommendations contained in United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Information Notice No. IN-2013/198 - Go-around Training for Aeroplanes may be consulted. [SR05/2020]. that Emirates implement changes to crew resource management training taking into consideration the lessons of the EK521 Accident. [SR06/2020]. that Emirates reiterate to flight crew the effects on aircraft performance due to wind changes that can affect landing, and the importance of effective monitoring of the flight instrumentation during a windshear warning. [SR07/2020]. that Emirates examine the training system to assess its adequacy in enhancing the cockpit instrumentation monitoring skills of flight crew. [SR08/2020]. that Emirates enhance the simulated training scenarios for a normal go-around before and after touchdown. The training and simulator sessions should emphasize the importance of performing and verifying each procedural step. [SR09/2020]. that Emirates include evacuation scenarios where the escape slides are affected by wind in cabin crew training. [SR10/2020]. that Emirates for quick access, ensure that the evacuation checklist is displayed securely in a position in the cockpit easily visible to the flight crew. [SR11/2020]. that Dubai Air Navigation Services (DANS) ensure that best practice guidelines for the transmission of air traffic control instructions to flight crew be reviewed and included in unit procedures and continuation training for all current and future air traffic controllers. These guidelines should include, consideration of appropriate times and conditions when air traffic controllers may establish communication and issue instructions, with particular emphasis regarding critical phases of flight. Note: Further reference may be found in EASA Safety Information Bulletin 2014-06 and GCAA Safety Alert 09/2016. [SR12/2020]. that DANS implement procedures to ensure that the air traffic control missed approach procedure in the Dubai manual of air traffic service (DMATS) is consistent and aligned with the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) of the United Arab Emirates. Note: Reference should be made to European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Safety Information Bulletin (SIB) No. 2014-06. [SR13/2020]. that DANS implement procedures and guidance that would limit the air traffic controller, to the maximum extent, from distracting the flight crew by issuing instructions modifying the published missed approach procedures in case of a missed approach. Note: Reference should be made to European Aviation
