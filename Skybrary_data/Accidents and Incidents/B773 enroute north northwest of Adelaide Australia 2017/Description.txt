On 14 October 2017, a Boeing 777-300ER (A6-ETR) was being operated by Etihad on a scheduled international passenger flight from Abu Dhabi to Sydney at night with an augmented crew when a burning smell coming from an air vent in the flight deck was followed by a lower deck hold fire warning. After discharging the hold fire extinguisher, a MAYDAY diversion was made to Adelaide without further event. After landing, a fire service inspection found no evidence of an active fire and a precautionary rapid disembarkation was completed.
