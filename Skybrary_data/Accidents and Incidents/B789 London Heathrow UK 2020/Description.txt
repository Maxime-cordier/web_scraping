On 9 February 2020, a Boeing 787-9 (VH-ZND) being operated by Qantas on a scheduled international passenger flight from London Heathrow to Perth received a tail strike prevention system annunciation as it took off in day VMC. The required response procedure included not pressurising the aircraft so an overweight return to land followed. The only damage to the aircraft was the abraded tail strike detection sensor.
