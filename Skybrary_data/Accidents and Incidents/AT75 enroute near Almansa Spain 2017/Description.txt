On 9 September 2017, an ATR 72-500 (EC-KKQ) being operated by Swiftair on a domestic passenger flight from Alicante to Madrid for Air Europa as AEA4050 was climbing in icing conditions when control of the aircraft was temporarily lost in day IMC. After recovery, the crew continued to report control problems and declared a MAYDAY requesting priority routing to their destination where the flight was completed with a high speed unstabilised approach. One of the 22 passengers required medical attention on arrival after appearing to suffer a prolonged anxiety attack following the stall episode; others with similar responses to it recovered quickly.
