On 22 December 2008, a Boeing 757-200 powered by Pratt & Whitney PW2037 engines and being operated by Delta Air Lines on a scheduled passenger flight departing Las Vegas for New York JFK in normal day visibility experienced sudden failure of the right engine as take off thrust was set and the aircraft was stopped on the runway for fire services inspection. Fire service personnel observed a hole in the bottom of the right engine nacelle and saw a glow inside so they discharged a fire bottle into the nacelle through the open pressure relief doors. In the absence of any contrary indications, this action was considered to have extinguished any fire and the aircraft was then taxied back to the gate on the remaining serviceable engine for passenger disembarkation. None of the 263 occupants were injured but the affected engine suffered significant damage.
