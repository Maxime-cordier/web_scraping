after the aircraft to which it had been given read it back. It was observed that the ANSP involved, LVNL, had “no written rules on whether or not to permit the continuation of work following incidents” and that “these events did have some effect on the mental resilience of the runway controller” when he created the conflict under investigation. It was noted that the internal investigation conducted as a result of the event had “concluded that the use of runway 18C as a runway for departing traffic, in combination with simultaneous use of other runways, can be referred to as an operation with increased complexity”. The Investigation noted that the only reason why the issue of simultaneous clearances to occupy the same active runway by the TWR controller had not resulted in a potentially fatal collision was “the fact that both crews involved were communicating on the same radio frequency (in the same language) and were able to see each other”. However, in the case of the 737, the use of an RET for an intersection departure had meant that once they had passed the holding point, any crew would have had difficulty in seeing approaching traffic which had begun its takeoff from the start of the runway. The Conclusions of the Investigation included the observations that: a review of the process following incidents involving controllers during their shift before they are permitted to continue in position is appropriate.. attention should be given to the relationship between this event and the practice of permitting intersection takeoffs.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 15 June 2020.
