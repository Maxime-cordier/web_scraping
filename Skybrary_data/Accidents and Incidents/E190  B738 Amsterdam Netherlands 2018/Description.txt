On 27 July 2018, a Boeing 737-800 (PH-BXI) being operated by KLM on a scheduled international passenger flight from Amsterdam to Hamburg as KL1783 was cleared to takeoff from an RET access to runway 18C after an Embraer ERJ190-100 operated by KLM Cityhopper on a scheduled international passenger flight from Amsterdam to Edinburgh as KL1289 had already been cleared for a full length takeoff from the same runway. The 737 crew stopped beyond the holding point but just clear of the runway as the Embraer passed at high speed as its crew rejected their takeoff. Day VMC prevailed.
