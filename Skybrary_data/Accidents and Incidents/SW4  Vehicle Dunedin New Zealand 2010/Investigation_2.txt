selected to reverse pitch following touchdown. The Investigation found that: “a very high potential collision risk had existed, which had been mitigated only by the fact the vehicle on the runway during the aircraft landing roll had elected, outwith any consideration or awareness of a collision risk, to keep to the side of the runway”. and concluded that: “the Security Patrol Vehicle involved had conducted an unauthorised but nevertheless custom-and-practice manoeuvre whilst being driven by an inadequately trained driver. The context for the established and inappropriate custom and practice was a lack of proper procedures for airside and, in particular, runway access by the organisation responsible for airport security". The Investigation noted that, despite the serious shortcomings in security training and local procedures disclosed, five years of internal audit and six years of Civil Aviation Authority audits of the Dunedin Security function had made “no findings or observations relevant to the runway incursion incident”. Safety Action taken by the Aviation Security Service since the incident to improve both the training of aviation security officers and the applicable procedures for airside access were noted. The Final Report of the Investigation: Report 10-006 was approved for publication in December 2010. No Safety Recommendations were issued but the completion of a comprehensive series of necessary Safety Actions by the Security Agency involved in respect of the procedures and training applicable to their personnel was noted.
