On 29 April 2017, a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (G-ZBKF) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from London Heathrow to Delhi with an augmented crew was in the cruise at FL350 in unrecorded day flying conditions when an EICAS indication of increasing cabin altitude occurred. Due to despatch with one Environmental Control System (ECS) inoperative, a descent was initiated, a PAN and then, as cabin altitude exceeded 10,000 feet, a MAYDAY was declared and an air turnback was made to London Heathrow without further event.
