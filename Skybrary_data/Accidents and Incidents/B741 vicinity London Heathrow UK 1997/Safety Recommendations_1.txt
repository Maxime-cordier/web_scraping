"Whilst the primary cause of this incident was the ingestion by the right engine of a single 'large' bird which had approached the western area of Runway 27R undetected, it is apparent that there is a growing population of large birds adjacent to Heathrow Airport which poses an increasing hazard to aircraft. It is evident that the scale of this hazard needs to be quantified and improved measures devised to control the bird population in the short term and to further protect public transport aircraft using the Airport. An effective automated Airport system to detect large birds about to transit across the Airport could enable the pilots of departing or arriving aircraft to be alerted to potential multiple birdstrike conflicts. Such a future development could reduce the risk of a related large scale accident in the congested vicinity of the airport as a result of associated multiple engine damage, and also reduce the commercial costs of damage arising from lesser birdstrike incidents." As a result of such concerns and considerations, the following Safety Recommendations are made: Recommendation 98-58 In view of the apparent increased incidence of large bird formation (e.g. Canada Geese) transit flying over London Heathrow Airport, with the attendant increasing risk of multiple birdstrike occurrence involving departing or arriving public transport aircraft, it is recommended that Heathrow Airport Limited and the CAA should set up a working group, in conjunction with Airport Operators, to review available technology to determine if a radar based large bird flock detection system, or an alternative automated system, could more effectively alert pilots and ATC to potential multiple birdstrike encounters.. Recommendation 98-59 In order to reduce the risk of multiple large birdstrike encounters, involving bird formations overflying London Heathrow Airport conflicting with departing or arriving public transport aircraft, Heathrow Airport Limited should seek maximum cooperation with the relevant local authority bodies and associated land owners to expedite effective management of the associated large bird habitat and population around Heathrow Airport. Similar co-operative initiatives should be actively promoted by the CAA around other affected major airports in the UK.. Recommendation 99-18 The CAA should expand the remit of its sponsored current study by the Central Science Laboratory Birdstrike Avoidance Team of the habitat, population and transit flight behaviour of flocking large bird species around Heathrow Airport to include the formulation of recommendations on the best means of managing and reducing the associated hazard of multiple birdstrike encounters involving departing or arriving public transport aircraft.. In addition, since the detachment of large heavy engine nacelle parts from aircraft in flight poses a serious hazard to populated areas being overflown, the following Safety Recommendations are made: Recommendation 98-60 In order to reduce the likelihood of large intake assemblies suffering in-flight detachment from Pratt and Whitney JT9 powerplants on Boeing 747 aircraft as a result of bird ingestion damage induced vibration effects, the aircraft manufacturer should be review the reduction in the number of associated intake attachment bolts (from 74 to 37) which was introduced by Service
