airframe vibration. The vibration level increased as speed was reduced and flap progressively extended and was most marked at 205 KIAS with flaps 5. However, the level of vibration did not affect the operation of the aircraft and the crew did not experience any difficulty in reading the flight deck instruments. The commander positioned the aircraft for an ILS approach to Runway 27L with flap 25 selected; the approach and landing were normal with full reverse selected on the outboard engines after touchdown… …Initial examination…showed that the left inner (No 2) engine had suffered severe damage to the fan; two adjacent fan blades had lost substantial portions of their outer length and all the blades had some hard object damage. It was also observed that the complete intake assembly, fan cowls, jet pipe and exhaust cone had separated from the powerplant assembly; these components, together with fragments of fan blade and some feathered bird remains were retrieved from the western end of Runway 27R…The feathers…were identified as having come from a Grey Heron. …The overall damage to the engine was sufficient to render it beyond economic repair. …Typical Grey Herons fall into the weight range of 1.3 to 1.6 kg. and as such are regarded as large birds. The Pratt and Whitney JT9D engine was granted Type Approval by the FAA to earlier requirements in which the criteria for tolerance to the ingestion of large birds was specified in Advisory Circular 33-1A and was certificated by a test using two, 2 lbs birds. However, its performance in this incident indicated that the basic engine would probably have met current requirements for this category of engine."
