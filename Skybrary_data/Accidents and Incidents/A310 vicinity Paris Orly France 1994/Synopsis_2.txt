stall warning and the stick shaker did not function in a preventive manner.. The flight crew regained control of the aircraft after the stall.". Causes: "The direct causes of the unusual attitudes and the stall to which the aircraft was subjected were a movement of the THS towards the full pitch-up position and a rapid increase in thrust, both of which maneuvers were the due to the Captain, following an AFS mode reversion which was not understood. The pitch-up force caused a sudden change in attitude that the flight crew was unable to contain with the elevators. The following elements contributed to the incident: Too rapid an approach, due to a late start in the descent, followed by a reduction of the standard procedure.. Inadequate crew resource management.. Premature selection of the go around altitude and precipitous setting of the configuration with slats and flaps at 20-20, which led to activation of the speed protection.. Difficulty in understanding the action of the auto-throttle increasing thrust in its overspeed protection function..
