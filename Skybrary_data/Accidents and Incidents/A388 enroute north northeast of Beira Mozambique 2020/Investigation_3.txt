chime when the seat belt signs are turned on is improved.. The Cause of the accident was formally documented as “the severe turbulence of vertical gust forces imposed on the aircraft as it operated within an area associated with wet turbulence cells, resulting in the forceful movement of unsecured passengers and cabin crew members”. Two Contributory Factors were also identified as follows: After entering the Beira FIR, when wet turbulence was detected by the weather radar turbulence function, the flight crew did not use the full capabilities of the weather radar to obtain an accurate assessment of the distance of the area of greatest threat from the aircraft flight path.. There was insufficient time for the cabin crew to secure the cabin after the seat belt sign was turned on.. Safety Action opportunities relevant to the findings of this GCAA Investigation into action taken by Emirates as a result of the findings from a similar Airbus A380 turbulence event in July 2019 were noted to have included responses equally relevant to the broadly similar findings from this later event. The Final Report was issued on 16 January 2020. No new Safety Recommendations were issued in this Final Report because the AAIS Final Report into a similar Emirates Airbus A380 turbulence event east of Chennai India in July 2019 issued on 12 August 2020 addressed similar findings with relevant safety recommendations and included the operator’s corresponding response and action.
