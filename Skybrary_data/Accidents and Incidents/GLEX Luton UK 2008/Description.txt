On 29 January 2008, a Bombardier BD700 Global Express on a private passenger flight from Van Nuys, California to Luton experienced a single tyre failure when landing at destination in normal day visibility which caused significant secondary damage to the flight control system and localised structural damage to the wing. The aircraft was stopped on the runway and there were no injuries to the four occupants.
