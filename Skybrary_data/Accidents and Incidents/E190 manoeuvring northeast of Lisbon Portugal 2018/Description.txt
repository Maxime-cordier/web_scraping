On 11 November 2018, an Embraer 190-100LR (P4-KCJ) being operated by Air Astana on a non-revenue international positioning flight from Alverca to Almaty, Kazakhstan with a technical stop at Minsk, Belarus as KZR1388 became extremely difficult to control in day IMC almost immediately after takeoff with control repeatedly lost and then regained. After declaring an emergency, the crew was eventually able to partially recover normal control and, after being guided to Beja, a third attempt to land was successful after almost two hours airborne. One of the three company engineers on board as passengers sustained minor injuries and airframe limit load exceedances were substantial enough to place the aircraft beyond economic repair and thus a ‘hull loss’. A runway light was destroyed during the landing at Beja.
