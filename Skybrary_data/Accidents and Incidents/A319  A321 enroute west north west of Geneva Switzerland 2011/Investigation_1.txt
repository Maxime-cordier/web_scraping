An Investigation was carried out by the Swiss AIB using the aircraft DFDR data, recorded downlink data, recordings of ATC radar, the STCA log and ground communications and statements made by the pilots and controllers involved. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and FDR/QAR data from the two aircraft was not used. The conflict occurred in French airspace with the A319 working Marseille and was not reported to the Swiss Accident Investigation Board (SAIB) until three days after it had occurred. The SAIB then advised the Italian authorities who delegated the Investigation to the SAIB which commenced it on 26 August. The A319 was given and correctly read back a clearance to continue climb to FL350 by Geneva ACC. This level was 2000 feet below that of the cruising level of the A321 - FL370 - which was heading south east on a crossing track and already working a different Geneva sector. However, despite the correct readback, the A319 crew then entered FL390 in their Flight Management System without either pilot realising the error. Shortly afterwards, the A319 was transferred to the Marseilles ACC sector appropriate to the FL350 clearance. The radar display of the other Geneva ACC sector above the one which had been working the A319 did not show the radar label for it until the aircraft was about to make its initial call to Marseilles ACC and climbing through FL353 at 1400 fpm at which point the cleared level of the A319 was queried with the Geneva sector it had just been handed off from. The A319 crew made their first call to Marseilles, at that time a busy frequency, stating that they were “FL 354 climbing 390”. Eight seconds before this, the Marseillles ACC Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) had been activated as the A319 passed FL350 but by the time of the check in on frequency call, the flight label was only just beginning to show on the Marseilles ACC radar display. The Marseilles controller “was unable to determine the origin of” the A319 call and addressed another aircraft 16 seconds later before instructing the A319 to “maintain 350 on reaching”. Upon receiving the response of the A319 crew “maintain 390 reaching” they transmitted immediately “I confirm level 350”, at which point the aircraft had just passed FL361. Following a call from another aircraft, the controller instructed the A319 “to descend immediately to FL350” and advised of the other traffic just above. This call was correctly acknowledged. By this time, TCAS TAs had already been generated on board both aircraft by the impending conflict and this was followed soon afterwards (but 27 seconds after the STCA in the Marseilles ACC had been activated) by STCA activations in both the Geneva sectors. Ten seconds after this, the A321 received a “Climb” RA and the crew responded accordingly. Four seconds later, the A319 received an “Adjust Vertical Speed” RA followed after another four seconds by a “Descend” RA. It was found that CPA between the two aircraft of 2.1nm
