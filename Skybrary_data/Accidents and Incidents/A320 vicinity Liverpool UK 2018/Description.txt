On 24 June 2018, an Airbus A320 (G-EZOZ) being operated by EasyJet on a scheduled international passenger flight from Liverpool to Paris CDG had just taken off in day VMC when the Captain inadvertently selected the flaps/slats up instead of the gear when “gear up” was called by the First Officer. Corrective action followed promptly and the flight was completed without actual risk of loss of control and without further event.
