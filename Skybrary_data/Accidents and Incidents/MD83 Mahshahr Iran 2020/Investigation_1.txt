An Investigation was carried out by the Iranian CAO Air Accident Investigation Board (AAIB). The SSCVR and SSFDR were recovered and their data successfully downloaded. Relevant recorded ATC data was also available. Both pilots were Iranian Nationals. The 64 year-old Captain, who was PF for the accident flight, had a total of 18,430 hours flying experience which included 7,840 hours on type, all but 81 hours of which were as Captain. He had previously flown for Kish Airlines on the F50 and MD80 fleets before moving to Caspian Airlines since when he had flown 477 hours on the MD80. It was reported that he had also been observed to fly other unstabilised approaches at different airports. The 28 year-old First Officer had a total of just 300 hours flying experience of which 124 hours were on type. The cruise from Tehran was at FL320 working Tehran Radar. Shortly after being cleared for the initial descent to FL100, the Descent/Approach Checklist was completed “but landing data and briefing were not completely done”. The Investigation noted that the ELW was 58 tonnes which would mean a VAPP of 136 KIAS and a VREF of 131 KIAS. The flight then made contact with the Mahshahr AFISO who advised that runway 31 was in use with the wind 280°/ 8 knots. On hearing this, the flight then requested runway 13 instead and this was approved with a VOR/DME approach expected (although CAVOK (cloud and visibility ok) prevailed). Whilst in the descent to FL100, radar service was terminated and the flight transferred to Mahshahr. The flight was cleared to descend to 2000 feet for the VOR/DME approach to runway 13 and instructed to call leaving the procedure initial approach fix (IAF) at waypoint ‘GODMO’ for which the procedure crossing height was 2000 feet. The requested call was subsequently made as the aircraft descended through a recorded 6,647 feet at 243 KCAS and landing clearance was given. Passing 2,500 feet agl with the speed still high (219 KCAS), the AP was disengaged and the Captain “decided to control altitude & speed by executing a series of ‘S’ turns whilst continuing in sight of the ground”. Shortly after passing 1000 feet agl, the Captain asked the First Officer to set the approach speed which he did and called 135 knots as the FDR was recording 196 KCAS. EGPWS ‘SINK RATE’ Warnings began and continued until just before touchdown. The First Officer suggested reading the Landing Checklist, but the Captain “did not accept” although indicated that he intended to continue with his unstabilised high-speed approach and land. Finally, less than 90 seconds after leaving 2,500 feet, the aircraft touched down at a recorded 171 KCAS (VREF +40) two thirds of the way down the 2,695 metre-long runway nose landing gear first. Full reverse thrust and braking were not enough to prevent an overrun which continued for 450 metres onto a busy main road before the aircraft finally stopped. The First Officer claimed in his statement after the accident
