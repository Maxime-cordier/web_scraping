touchdown a ROPS ‘BRAKE MAX BRAKING MAX BRAKING’ Warning occurred indicating an overrun even though it did not take account of temporary reductions in LDA. In accordance with the briefing, the thrust reversers were not used and the PFs full manual braking then led to the ‘BRAKES HOT’ Alert following which the brake temperatures reached 600°C. During the whole of the landing roll, leaking fuel spilled onto the runway. The Relief First Officer asked if the left engine shutdown was being considered and the Captain responded that this would be done during the 180° turn at the end of the runway when the aircraft left engine was on the outside of the turn. FDR data then showed that around 40% N1 thrust was set on the left engine as the aircraft was turned. The TWR controller informed the crew that the airport RFFS personnel positioned near the runway had not seen any signs of fuel on it although at the time “substantial quantities” had been running out of the drain mast and nacelle under the engine. Having taxied the aircraft to its assigned parking position, the crew remained concerned about the still-high brake temperatures given the existence of a fuel leak. The right engine was then shut down ten minutes after the left and after the RFFS personnel had sprayed water under the left engine and assessed the situation as safe, passenger disembarkation began.. A comparison of the fuel used and remaining fuel was made and showed that 5,300 kg of fuel had been lost in flight and a further 400 kg was then lost on the ground until the right engine had been shutdown in the parking area.
