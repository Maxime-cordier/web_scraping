On 31 December 2020 , the crew of an Airbus A330-200 (F-GZCJ) being operated by Air France on a scheduled night international passenger flight from Brazzaville to Paris CDG with augmented crew in unspecified flight conditions identified a significant fuel leak during a routine top-of-climb fuel check. The applicable emergency procedure to shut down the affected engine and land as soon as possible was ignored. Instead the flight was continued on track for over 90 minutes before eventually diverting to N’Djaména where it was found that almost 6 tonnes of fuel had been lost. The aircraft was undamaged and the 147 occupants were not injured. The leak was sourced to a mis-fitted main fuel hose at the engine/pylon interface.
