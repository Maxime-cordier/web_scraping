On 27 August 2016, a Boeing 737-700 (N766SW) being operated by Southwest Airlines on a domestic passenger flight from New Orleans to Orlando as flight 3472 was climbing through FL 310 and passing south of Mobile over the Gulf of Mexico when a sudden explosive noise was followed by indications of left engine failure. Resultant debris penetrated the left side of the passenger cabin and a rapid depressurisation followed. An emergency descent and a diversion to Pensacola followed without further event and on arrival a normal passenger disembarkation occurred. There were no injuries to the 104 occupants but the aircraft sustained substantial damage including a large hole in the left side fuselage shell.
