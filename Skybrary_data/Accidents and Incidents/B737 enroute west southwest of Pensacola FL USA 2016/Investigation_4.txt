This procedure involves a manual scan of both the concave and convex sides of the dovetail with the blade coating removed followed by an ECI. This has a higher sensitivity than a Florescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI) and can detect cracks near the surface as well as on it.. In March 2017, a new series of ultrasonic crack inspections which can be performed without the need to remove the blade coating and can therefore be carried out at the same time as on-wing blade re-lubrications were introduced.. The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 30 March 2020. No new Safety Recommendations were made.
