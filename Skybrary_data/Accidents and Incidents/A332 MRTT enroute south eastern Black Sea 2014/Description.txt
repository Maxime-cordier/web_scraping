On 9 February 2014, a Royal Air Force-operated Voyager (ZZ333), the UK military designation of the Airbus Multi Role Tanker Transport derivative of the Airbus A330-200, was on a passenger flight from RAF Brize Norton, UK to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan and in the cruise in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) at FL 330 when it suddenly and very violently pitched down very rapidly losing over 4000 feet of altitude before recovery to controlled flight occurred. Almost all of the 198 occupants who were unrestrained at the time were thrown towards the ceiling with a considerable number of minor injuries and damage to cabin fittings resulting. After recovery to controlled flight, a MAYDAY was declared and a diversion to the Turkish airbase at Incirlik, near Adana was completed.
