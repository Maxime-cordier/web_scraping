On 15 October 2011 a Saab 340 being operated by Loganair on a scheduled cargo flight from Aberdeen to Stornoway was inbound on a procedural non precision approach to runway 18 in day Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and level at 2000 feet Altimeter Pressure Settings when it received a TCAS RA ‘DESCEND’ against opposite direction traffic level at the same altitude and responded accordingly. The other aircraft was also being operated by Loganair on a scheduled passenger flight from Inverness to Stornoway and was outbound on the same procedural non precision approach. The inbound aircraft flew a go around following the avoidance manoeuvre and the second aircraft completed the procedure and landed.
