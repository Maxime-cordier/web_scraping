The following is an extract from the Synopsis to the official Accident Reprt published by the Nigerian Ministry of Aviation: "On Saturday, 10th December, 2005, the Sosoliso aircraft registered 5NBFD with call sign OSL 1145 departed Abuja at 1225 hours UTC on a scheduled passenger flight en-route Port Harcourt with 110 persons on Board (103 passengers and 7 crew). The flight continued normally until final approach to Port Harcourt. The aircraft was carrying out an ILS approach to Runway 21 and had reported established on the glide and localiser at 6 miles to touch down. The controller then cleared the aircraft to land but to exercise caution as the runway surface was slightly wet and the pilot acknowledged. Soon after, the aircraft made impact with the grassy strip between Runway 21 and taxiway i.e. 70m to the left of the runway edge and 540m from the Runway 21 threshold. At about 60m from the first impact, the aircraft tail section impacted heavily with a concrete drainage culvert and the aircraft then disintegrated and caught fire along its path. The total wreckage trail covered a distance of 1120 m. The accident resulted in 108 fatalities and 2 survivors."
