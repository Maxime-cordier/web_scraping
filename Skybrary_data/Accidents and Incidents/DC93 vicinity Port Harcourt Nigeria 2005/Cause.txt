"The probable cause of the accident was the crew's decision to continue the approach beyond the Decision Altitude without having the runway and/or airport in sight. The contributory factors were: The crew's delayed decision to carry out a missed approach and the application of improper procedure while executing the go-around.. The aircraft encountered adverse weather conditions with the ingredients of wind shear activity on approach.. The reducing visibility in thunderstorm and rain as at the time the aircraft came in to land was also a contributory factor to the accident. And the fact the airfield lightings were not on may also have impaired the pilot from sighting the runway.. Another contributory factor was the fact that the aircraft had an impact with the exposed drainage concrete culvert which led to its disintegration and subsequent tire outbreak.". The Final Report of the Investigation was issued by the Accident Investigation & Prevention Bureau of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Aviation on 20 July 2006.
