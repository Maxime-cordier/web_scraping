The investigation of the Serious Incident came to the following probable cause: The decision of the Flight Crew, to continue an approach using visual cues alone, having mis-identified the lights of a building with the approach lights of the landing runway. Along with the latter, several contributing factors are mentioned. Some of them are the visual resemblance of the building in night conditions with the approach lights, non-adherence to Company SOPs, poor Crew Resource Management (Crew Resource Management), etc. The recommendations comprise comprehensive review of the CRM training of the operator and airport control tower manning level examination by IAA. Furthermore, the IAA, when considering the type and positioning of warning lights specified for an obstacle in the vicinity of an aerodrome, should take account of the potential for confusion by pilots of such lights with visual navigation aids at the aerodrome.
