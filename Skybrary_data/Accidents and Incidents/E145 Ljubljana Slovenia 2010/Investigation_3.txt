track and with a high conventional speed. Continuation of the unstabilised approach, in turbulent conditions, led to the hard landing. Overconfidence on the part of the pilot-in-command in combination with the passive attitude of the co-pilot following the transfer of control in the final approach resulted in an authority gradient in the cockpit. In these circumstances, an interruption of the approach was not envisaged by the crew despite the identification of several EGPWS alarms and the stabilisation conditions not being met. The following Contributory Factors were also identified: the failure to update the arrival briefing after receiving authorisation to perform a visual approach;. during the visual approach, the assessment of the situation by the crew without recourse to the available information. This information is all the more useful in a mountainous environment where ground relief can distort the assessment of the approach track to follow;. the distribution of tasks within the crew. It was in fact less convenient for the PF, sat on the right, to visually locate the ground during the turns on base leg and final approach.. The Final Report of the Investigation was issued in a French language version only on 27 June 2012 and is also available here on SKYbrary in an unofficial English language translation. No Safety Recommendations were made and no Safety Action reported.
