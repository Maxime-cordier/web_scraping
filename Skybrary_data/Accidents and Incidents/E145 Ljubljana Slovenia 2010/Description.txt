On 24 May 2010, an Embraer 145 (F-GUBF) being operated for Air France by wholly owned subsidiary airline Regional on a scheduled passenger flight from Paris CDG to Ljubljana landed with a excessive rate of descent at destination after requesting and gaining approval for a visual approach in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) which was misjudged and became unstabilised. The aircraft sustained significant although repairable damage but none of the 52 occupants were injured and it was possible to taxi the aircraft to its parking position.
