number of distractions during the approach degraded the crew’s situation awareness and resulted in the crew not detecting the incorrect aircraft configuration.. The Captain did not appropriately monitor the aircraft’s configuration or the actions of the first officer.. Two other ‘Safety Factors’ were also identified: The lack of effective intra-crew communication accentuated their loss of situation awareness.. The First Officer’s decision making was probably affected by fatigue.. The Final Report Aviation Occurrence Investigation AO-2010-035 was published on 19 April 2012. No formal Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation but Safety Action taken by aircraft operator JetStar in response to the event were noted.
