On 29 March 2016, an Antonov AN-26B (S2-AGZ) being operated by True Aviation on a non scheduled domestic cargo flight from Coxâ€™s Bazar to Jessore, reported an engine failure immediately after takeoff and an immediate return was requested. After two discontinued approaches the crew subsequently lost control at a low altitude and were unable to recover before impact with the sea surface which destroyed the aircraft and caused the death of three of the four flight crew on board and serious injuries to the other one, the Navigator.
