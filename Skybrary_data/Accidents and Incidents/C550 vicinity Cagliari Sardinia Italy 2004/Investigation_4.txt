terrain during a visual approach at night in the absence of adequate visual references”. Seven possible Contributory Factors were identified, as follows: The absence of TAWS, although noted that this was not a regulatory requirement.. The mistaken acquisition of visual cues believed by the crew to be the lights of Cagliari aerodrome, noting that “the crew was not particularly familiar with the area” and that there was a possibility that they had been subject to the effects of the optical illusion known as the ‘black hole approach’.. The possibility that the instruction given by Cagliari approach not to descend below 2500 feet QNH may have been interpreted, despite the crew confirming that they would be able to ensure their clearance from obstacles, as meaning that descent to that altitude would be free of obstacles.. The crew’s failure to use the available instrument approach procedure despite their destination being an unfamiliar airport in an unknown area flown under conditions of total darkness.. The crew’s request to deviate from the IFR route may have been due to a desire to speed up their arrival at the destination.. The crew’s failure to note from the chart carried that high terrain was present, which would have been more likely in the absence of colour contouring of terrain on the chart.. The prolonged period during which the crew had been awake may have contributed to a reduction in their performance.. A total of eight Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation. Three were issued on 14 July 2004 as follows: that ENAV (the State agency responsible for the provision of civil ATS) avoids reference to documents which are difficult to obtain and only written in Italian and provides for publication in the Italian AIP of the full technical and operational requirements currently prescribed in such documents. [ANSV-21/28/4-1/A/04]. that in order to avoid the extensive misinterpretation of the text (contained in currently prescribed technical and operational requirements) ENAV revises them giving particular attention to those specified in Section 3 of ENAC (Italian CAA) provision No 41/8880/AM.O so as to indicate explicitly what prevents a procedural instrument approach being performed. [ANSV-22/28/4-2/A/04]. that ENAC should reconsider, in the light of the (availability of GPWS/TAWS), the minimum equipment which should be required in order to perform a night visual approach. [ANSV-23/28/4-3/A/04]. Five further Recommendations, the first re-iterating Recommendation [ANSV-23/28/4-3/A/04] issued during the Investigation but which had not resulted in a corresponding change to requirements, were issued in the Final Report as follows: that ENAC with EASA should reconsider a requirement to mandate TAWS carriage on turbine aircraft up to 5700 kg mass capable of carrying six to nine passengers in order to reduce the risk of CFIT accidents. [ANSV-1/28-04/4/A/09]. that ENAC should evaluate the possibility of raising the awareness of pilots of the risks of the optical illusion known as the “black hole” effect during initial and recurrent training. [ANSV-2/28-04/5/A/09]. that ENAC, the Italian Air Force and ENAV should establish a system which ensures regular monitoring
