An Investigation was carried out by the Air Accident Investigation Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK). Both the FDR and the two-hour CVR were recovered from the wreckage having sustained "substantial mechanical damage" but the data from both was successfully downloaded. Recorded ATC radar and communications data were also available. An Interim Report with some initial factual information and including five "Prompt Safety Recommendations" was issued on 20 April 2016. These Recommendations were intended to direct attention to what appeared to be key aspects of the accident at that time and were as follows: Inform the flight and maintenance personnel operating Boeing Ð’737-800 aircraft about the accident.. Have additional training on elements of go-arounds in various conditions, in manual control mode with two engines operative from various heights and at low aircraft weights.. Study the possibility of introducing into the Full Flight Simulator (FFS) training program scenarios which involve go arounds in various conditions, including under manual control with two engines operative from various commencement heights.. Carefully study and analyse the implementation of Safety recommendations issued by investigation teams which investigated the 2013 Boeing 737-500 accident near Kazan Airport and the 2006 A320 accident near Sochi Airport.. Carefully study the potential applicability of the Safety Recommendations to prevent accidents and incidents during go-around developed in the BEA Study on Aeroplane state awareness during go-around (ASAGA) and take any applicable safety measures.. Upon completion of the Investigation, a fully detailed reconstruction of what had happened and the most likely explanations provided by the available evidence was made available and a summary of this now follows. The Flight Crew It was noted that the 37 year-old Captain had a total of 5,965 flying hours of which 4,692 hours had been on type and 1,056 hours of those had been in command.

Prior to 2004, the Captain had been flying light aircraft (under 5,700 kg) but had then qualified as a 737 Classic pilot and worked for Cyprus-based Helios Airways as a First Officer between 2004 and 2006 before moving to do the same job at UK-based XL Airways between 2006 and 2008. In 2011 he obtained a 737 Classic First Officer job with Malaysian Airlines System before joining Flydubai as a First Officer in 2012. His 737 NG transition training had then been completed at the CAE flight training facility in Dubai prior to commencing line flying. He had completed command up grade training for the 737-800 in January 2015. The First Officer had also initially flown professionally in light aircraft before working as a First Officer on the ATR 42/72 for a Spanish regional airline between 2006 and 2008 and then, after almost a year unemployed, worked as an ATR 42/72 pilot between
