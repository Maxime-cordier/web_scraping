go-around - despite the low weight of the aircraft, the crew was performing a standard go-around procedure (with the retraction of landing gear and flaps), but using the maximum available thrust consistent with the Windshear Escape Manoeuvre procedure that had led to the generation of a substantial excessive nose-up moment and significant (up to 23 kg) ‘pushing’ force on the control column to counteract it;. the failure of the aircraft commander over a long time to fly the pitch required to perform a go around and maintain the required climb profile while piloting an aircraft unbalanced in forces;. the insufficient knowledge and skills of the aircraft commander in respect of the operation of the manual stabiliser trim which led to the long period (12 seconds) of continuous stabiliser nose-down trim with the subsequent substantial imbalance of the aircraft and its upset encounter with the generation of the negative ‘g’ which the crew had not been prepared for. The potential impact of a somatogravic ‘pitch-up illusion’ on the aircraft commander might have contributed to the long time he kept the stabiliser trim switches pressed;. the psychological incapacitation of the aircraft commander resulting in his total spatial disorientation which did not allow him to respond to the correct prompts of the First Officer;. the absence of criteria for assuming the psychological incapacitation of a pilot in the airline OM which prevented the First Officer recognising the situation in time to take more decisive action;. the possible ‘operational’ tiredness of the crew since by the time of the accident the crew had been in flight for 6 hours including 2 hours under a high workload that involved the need to make non-standard decisions; in this context the accident occurred at the worst possible time in terms of the circadian rhythms - at a time when human performance is severely degraded to its lowest level along with an increase in the risk of error.. It was also noted that “the lack of the objective information on the operation of the HUD” during non-normal circumstances (flight testing of the HUD did not cover the entire range of ‘g’ which might be experienced, including negative ‘g’) and the impossibility of reproducing the HUD display as it would have been seen when reconstructing the progress of the accident flight (as also affected by the pilot’s posture in his seat at the time) did not allow conclusions to be drawn in respect of its possible effect on the outcome of the flight”. The Investigation team also concluded that “the specific features of the HUD indication and display in the conditions which existed during the final phase of the accident flight (severe turbulence, the aircraft upset encounter with the resulting negative ‘g’ and the significant difference between the actual and the target flight path) that generally do not occur during standard simulator sessions, could have affected the situational awareness of the aircraft commander having (already) been in a highly stressed state”.
