On 19 March 2016, a Boeing 737-800 (A6-FDN) being operated by Flydubai on a scheduled international passenger flight from Dubai to Rostov-on-Don as FDB 981 failed to complete a second approach at destination and, following an initial climb, transitioned to a steep descent whilst in night IMC and subsequently crashed onto the intended landing runway. The aircraft was destroyed by the high energy impact and the explosion which followed and all 55 passengers and 7 crew members were killed. Damage was caused to the runway surface and to runway lighting and the airport remained closed for two days to allow wreckage recovery and infrastructure repairs.
