On 7 July 2014, an Airbus A320 (9M-AQA) being operated by Air Asia Berhad on a scheduled international passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur to Brunei (Bandar Seri Begawan) as AK278 touched down at destination on the right hand edge of runway 03 and then ran onto the grass alongside it and continued to slowly deviate from the runway axis until coming to a stop 1,300 metres from the landing threshold. An emergency evacuation was ordered and accomplished during which 1 of the 109 occupants was slightly injured. The excursion caused damage to the aircraft landing gear and both engines and also to aerodrome lighting, signage and electrical supply infrastructure.
