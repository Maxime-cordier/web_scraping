On 26 January 2020, a Sikorsky S76B (N72EX) being operated by Island Express Helicopters on a non-scheduled night VFR passenger flight from Santa Ana (SNA) to Camarillo (CMA) in marginal weather conditions and carrying eight passengers was seen to emerge from low cloud in a left turn 1-2 seconds before an impact which destroyed the helicopter and killed all nine occupants.
