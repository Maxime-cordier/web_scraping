On 31 December 2019, an Airbus A330-300 (TC-LOL) being operated by THY Turkish Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Istanbul to Port Harcourt as THY3WJ departed the right side of the 60 metre-wide destination landing runway following an ILS approach in night VMC before regaining it after which the rest of the landing roll was completed normally. There was no injury to the 295 occupants but three runway edge lights were damaged and the aircraft sustained damage to three of its main gear tyres, one of which was completely deflated, and minor damage to the internal fan cowl of the right engine and to the right inboard flap.
