On 10 February, 2007 an Airbus 320-200 being operated by JetBlue Airways on a scheduled passenger flight from New York JFK to Nassau was climbing through 7000 feet in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when the cabin crew reported to the flight deck that there were signs of smoke from an actual or incipient overhead bin fire. Whilst the cabin crew discharged a fire extinguisher into the locker and then at the source bag after removing it, the flight crew levelled the aircraft at 7600 feet, declared an emergency and made a priority return to JFK which was reached without further event six minutes later. After stopping on the runway to confirm that no continuing hazard existed, the aircraft was taxied in to the gate and passengers left normally.
