a TCAS 'CLIMB' RA was annunciated on the A320 flight deck. At this point, the two aircraft were estimated to be about 270 metres apart laterally and converging rapidly in the vertical plane. Their closest proximity (CPA) occurred 11 seconds later (40 seconds after the A320 had taken off) as both aircraft, respectively descending (737) and climbing (A320) crossed at 1600 feet agl (2400 feet QNH) with an estimated lateral separation of approximately 90 metres. Shortly before the CPA, the A320, approaching its clearance limit of 2600 feet QNH, was instructed by TWR to stop as cleared but responded TCAS CLIMB and continued. Just before the CPA, it was found that 737 crew had visually acquired the A320 and executed a 30º roll to the right to increase clearance. EDITORS NOTE: The wingspans of both the aircraft involved are in the vicinity of 35 metres. TCAS annunciations 'Clear of Conflict' occurred on both aircraft flight decks 11 seconds after the CPA. Thereafter, with both aircraft still on approximately the same ground track, the 737 resumed its climb from below the A320 whilst the latter, aware of the previous TWR request to stop at 2600 feet QNH transmitted to TWR “Levelling out at 3000, Confirm that”. In absence of any TWR response to this call, the crew did so. A further conflict scenario then followed with new coordinated TCAS RAs generated 14 seconds after the original 'Clear of Conflict' annunciations. The 737 RA was a preventive 'DON'T CLIMB' and the A320 a 'CLIMB' and both were initially complied with. Then, TWR replied to the previous A320 call mentioning 3000 feet with "maintain 2600" which was followed in preference to continuing the CLIMB RA. Whilst the two aircraft were still in the TCAS RA-annunciated phase of conflict, TWR instructed both aircraft to change to Radar. Subsequently, after 35 seconds of RA, and 1 minute and 42 seconds after the A320 became airborne, 'Clear of Conflict' was again annunciated to both crews as the A320 passed 4440 feet QNH and the 737 passed 2800 feet QNH. The diagram below shows the vertical profile of the flight paths of both aircraft. The Investigation's overall findings included the following: It would have been expected that, in the knowledge that the departing A320 would need a 3 minute separation behind the 787, TWR would not have lined up the A320 given the range of the 737 on final.. Once the A320 was on the runway, it should have been clear at an early stage that a landing clearance would not be possible unless the A320 was instructed to vacate the runway and when it was not, it was inappropriate to delay the go around instruction to the 737.. The behaviour of the Instructor in respect of his failure to properly supervise the trainee was inappropriate.. When the 737 announced it was going around, the A320 should have rejected its take off.. Thereafter, neither flight crew made optimum use of their TCAS RA traffic displays, especially when
