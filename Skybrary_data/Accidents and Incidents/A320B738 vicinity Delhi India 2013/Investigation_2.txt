after a Boeing 787 had taken off. The student controller had been advised by the A320 crew that a wait on the runway until the desired wake vortex separation (3 minutes) had been achieved would be necessary. At the time that the A320 actually entered the runway, the 737 was on TWR frequency and was passing 1737 feet agl at a speed of 156 KCAS. One minute and 20 seconds later, the A320 was lined up and stationary by which time the 737 was passing 1482 feet agl and TWR advised the A320 that a further 1 minute 22 seconds wait would be required. The 737 CVR showed that by this time, its crew were of the opinion that "ATC is pushing them into a very tight situation" and had already reviewed the go around procedure. With take off clearance, the A320 subsequently began its take off roll without delay once the required waiting time had elapsed. At this point, the 737 was 275 feet agl without a landing clearance but with advice from the trainee controller to expect this on "short short final". With the A320 22 seconds into its take off roll and at a groundspeed of 82 knots, the 737 commenced and announced on TWR frequency a go around - the minimum height as this was commenced was 29 feet agl. No go around or any other instruction was given by the trainee but before vacating the position soon afterwards without an immediate take over of the position by anyone else, he acknowledged the 737 go around transmission with "Expedite, report passing 2600 feet". The qualified controller who had earlier signed off took over the position and the A320 became airborne with the 737 at 455 feet agl (1420 feet QNH) on a similar track to but behind the A320 and climbing more slowly. Separation was therefore being rapidly eroded. TWR instructed the 737 to expedite the climb and report passing 3600 feet QNH and the A320 to climb to and maintain 2600 feet QNH. As the 737 climbed though 1160 feet agl at 2070 fpm (and thereby exceeded the TCAS RA suppression threshold of 1100 feet agl for climbing aircraft) 17 seconds after the A320 had got airborne, a TCAS RA 'CLIMB' was received which immediately changed to 'DESCEND, DESCEND NOW' at 1500 fpm as the minimum height for descend advisories - 1200 feet agl was also exceeded. As the A320 was still below 1100 feet agl, no co-ordinated TCAS RA was annunciated - although a TA was - and it continued climbing as the 737 descended towards it from above following its RA. Contrary to the requirement for maximum TCAS RA response times (for a reversal, 2.5 seconds), the 737 crew were still in the process of converting their 2070 fpm climb into the RA-required rate of descent as closure continued and the 737 was still faster than the A320 when, 12 seconds after its annuciation the 737 RA had strengthened to 'INCREASE DESCENT' whilst
