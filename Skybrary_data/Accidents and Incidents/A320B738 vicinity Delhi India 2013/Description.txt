On 2 September 2013, a B737-800 (VT-SPJ) being operated by Spicejet on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Shamshabad to Dehli as SEJ234 initiated a late go around from an approach to runway 28 at destination when it became apparent that a landing clearance would not be issued because an Airbus AIRBUS A-320 (VT-IEB) being operated by Indigo on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Dehli to Coimbatore was still not airborne from the same runway. The two aircraft subsequently came into close proximity twice as they followed similar flight paths in their respective climbs.
