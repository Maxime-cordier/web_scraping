On 12 January 2012, an EC 225LP (LN-OJE) being operated by CHC Helikopter Service on a contract passenger shuttle service for Statoil from the Deep Sea Bergen oil rig to Kristiansund as HKS 403 in the climb at night to 3000 feet after departure experienced a partial hydraulic system failure. Because of destination weather considerations the crew decided to make an en route diversion. After a Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) approach to the Åsgård B Platform and a normal touch down, the helicopter began to move towards the edge of the helideck and an emergency evacuation was ordered. Ground crew action helped ensure that the helicopter remained on the helideck. None of the 21 occupants were injured and the helicopter sustained only minor damage.
