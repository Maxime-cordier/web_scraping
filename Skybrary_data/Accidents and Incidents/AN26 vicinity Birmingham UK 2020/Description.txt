On 16 July 2020, an Antonov AN26B (UR-CQD) being operated by Vulkan Air on a non scheduled international cargo flight from an unrecorded airport to Birmingham which was being used for a final line check made two consecutive non-precision approaches to runway 33 at night and in VMC for the final stages of both approaches, neither of which were flown in accordance with the corresponding procedure. Both were discontinued on ATC instructions before a third ILS approach to runway 15 was then completed normally.
