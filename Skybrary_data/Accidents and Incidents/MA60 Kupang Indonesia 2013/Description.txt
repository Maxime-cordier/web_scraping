On 10 June 2013, a XIAN Xian MA60 (PK-MZO) being operated by Indonesian carrier Merpati Nusantara on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Bajawa to Kupang/El Tari as MZ 6517 made a slightly steeper than usual visual final approach to the landing runway at destination and, after a sudden further increase in the rate of descent just before touchdown, hit the runway so hard that after it stopped, the wing box could be seen to have separated from the fuselage. Five of the 50 occupants, including one of the pilots, were seriously injured.
