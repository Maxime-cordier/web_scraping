On 4 March 2013, the professional pilot of a privately-operated Beechcraft Premier 1A (VP-CAZ) which had just taken off from Annemasse for Geneva in day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) lost control of the aircraft and it crashed just outside the aerodrome perimeter. The aircraft was destroyed by the impact and a post crash fire and two of the three occupants were killed and the third ejected from the aircraft during the impact sequence and seriously injured. Before final impact with the ground, the aircraft had hit trees and buildings, substantially damaging the roof of a nearby house.
