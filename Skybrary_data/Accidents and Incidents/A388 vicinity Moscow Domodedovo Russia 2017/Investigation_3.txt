the MAP. The flight was instructed to turn onto 070° and contact radar. Vectoring for a third approach was then commenced and when the radar controller asked for the reason for the go-around, the Captain again replied that the approach had been unstable. Vectoring for the third approach followed a similar base leg track to the first and on reporting fully established on the LLZ, the flight was transferred to TWR and the sector completed without further event. It was noted that the observed weather conditions were VMC throughout and were benign in all other respects including visibility in excess of 10km and no cloud below 4000 feet which would have ensured that the landing runway lights would have been visible during all three approaches. No evidence was found that indicated that fatigue played any part in the investigated events. It was concluded from the FMS ‘BITE’ data that the reason for the second approach being discontinued was that following the go-around, the FMS had not been reconfigured in accordance with the applicable SOP and that this precluded LLZ capture. Absence of the CVR data meant that it was difficult to assess flight crew communication, flight deck authority gradient, the efficiency and effectiveness with which checklists, briefings and call outs were performed and in the interaction between the two pilots. Nevertheless, the following findings were made in respect of the way the aircraft was managed: The aircraft was properly configured during all three approaches.. There was a lack of proper planning on the part of both pilots in respect of how to establish the aircraft on the runway 14R ILS during the first approach considering the relatively tight radar vectoring provided.. Both pilots failed to make several SOP calls and confirmations.. The prerequisite condition of the ‘glide interception from above’ procedure was not followed by the First Officer during the first approach.. Neither pilot was aware of the ICAO-specified envelope of glideslope signal coverage, the requirement to re-insert the runway 14R ILS approach after making a go-around in order to fly a second approach and the multi-waypoint sequencing when the aircraft cross-track position was less than 7 nm.. Neither pilot referred to and confirmed the vertical position of the aircraft using other available indications.. Whilst the pilots were able to understand the radar controller’s communications, the “do not descend further” instruction during the first approach was lengthy and the phraseology used was non-standard for an urgent instruction.. The Causes of the Serious Incident were formally determined as: The descent below the cleared altitude on the first approach can be explained by an erroneous flight crew perception that the aircraft would capture the 3° glideslope from above and by insufficient coordination between the flight crew members. After the First Officer carried out the ‘glide interception from above’ procedure, he focused on the horizontal position of the aircraft to establish it on the localiser and neither of the two pilots maintained a correct awareness of the vertical position of the aircraft..
