On 10 September 2017, an Airbus A380-800 (A6-EEZ) being operated by Emirates on a scheduled international passenger flight from Dubai to Moscow Domodedovo as EK 131 failed to establish on the ILS LLZ for runway 14R in day VMC before continuing descent below its cleared altitude. When the controller noticed this, they instructed it to stop descent but when the initiation of a go around was delayed, an EGPWS ‘PULL UP’ Warning followed during which a minimum of 395 feet agl was reached. On being informed of the intention to discontinue the approach, the controller instructed the aircraft to maintain its present (200°) heading and commence a climb. A second approach was discontinued from a safe altitude and a third was subsequently completed successfully.
