was changed back to ‘selected speed’ mode at 170 knots and speed began to increase to that level from a minimum of 158 knots. Approximately ten seconds later, with the aircraft about to capture the 2300 feet target altitude, the target was changed from 2,300 feet to 3,000 feet (which was above the procedure initial go-around altitude) and vertical speed setting was selected to 2,000 fpm. As the descent continued without having established on the LLZ, the radar controller instructed the flight to maintain the 220° heading to the final approach point (P) at 500 meters QFE (2230 feet QNH), provided the airport QNH of 1015 and instructed the crew to contact TWR. The crew did not reply to this transmission and 10 seconds later, the aircraft had just descended through 2000 feet QNH at 170 KCAS and was now on a heading of 210°. A few seconds later, the Radar Controller called again and instructed the flight crew to “maintain 500 metres height at QFE 994 (QNH 1015) and stop further descent”, repeating this three times and following with the advice that their transponder readout indicated a height of only 110 metres (360 feet) above the runway elevation. As this 17 second-long communication from the controller commenced, FDR data showed the flap being changed from configuration ‘3’ to ‘full’ with the aircraft 1,660 feet pressure altitude. Four seconds after it had finished, the selected vertical speed was changed from -2,000 fpm to +2,500 fpm and two seconds after that with the aircraft descending at 1,600 fpm, a go-around was initiated and declared by the Captain to ATC. The 14R ILS Chart as used by the flight crew. [Reproduced from the Official Report] At this point, the aircraft was turning left through 197° towards the ILS LLZ and descending through 1,140 feet QNH (504 feet agl) but still over 7nm from the runway. Almost immediately, a 6 second long EGPWS ‘PULL UP TERRAIN AHEAD’ Warning was annunciated at 474 feet agl and at 7.3 nm from the runway threshold. The minimum radio altitude recorded during EGPWS activation was 395 feet agl. The Radar Controller responded to the go-around declaration by instructing the flight to initially continue on its present 200° heading climbing to the equivalent of 3,550 feet QNH and when he subsequently asked for the reason for the go-around. The Captain replied that the approach had been unstable. Radar vectoring was then provided to a second approach and this time, the track passed approximately over the IAF at waypoint ‘AMTAM’ and followed the procedural track to the ILS 14R LLZ as shown on the chart. A closing radar heading of 220° was given and the flight transferred to TWR. The aircraft started to descend below the IF procedure altitude and was established on the LLZ at the final approach point ‘P’ and 100 feet below the GS. Ninety seconds after this, the Captain declared another go-around and the aircraft levelled off at 2,600 feet QNH, the final altitude for
