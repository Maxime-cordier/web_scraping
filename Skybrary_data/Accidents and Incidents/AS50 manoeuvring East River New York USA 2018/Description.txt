On 11 March 2018, an Airbus Helicopters AS350 B2 (N350LH) being operated by Liberty Helicopters on a commercial sightseeing flight around Manhattan in day VMC and carrying five passengers made an autorotation to controlled ditching in the East River after the engine stopped. The automatic flotation system failed to inflate symmetrically and the helicopter immediately rolled over before the occupants could exit and only the pilot was subsequently able to escape. The helicopter remained underwater supported by its partially inflated flotation system until recovered and moved to a hangar the following day.
