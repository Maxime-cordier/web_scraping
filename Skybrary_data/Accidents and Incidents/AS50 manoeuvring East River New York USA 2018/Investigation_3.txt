the front of both the left and right floats and had detected the extra drag their deployment had created. Shore witnesses’ videos showed the helicopter touching down upright and in a slightly shallow flare attitude before immediately beginning to roll to the right with the rotor blades striking the water within about five seconds of touchdown and the roll continuing so that the helicopter was “completely inverted and submerged with only the floats visible” only 11 seconds after touchdown. The pilot reported that he had been fully underwater and unable to release the buckle on his own installed, FAA-approved restraint to escape. None of the five passengers surfaced and divers subsequently found that none of them had been able to release themselves from their SPRS harness/tether systems, an action which would have required them to use a cutting device in a pouch attached to their harnesses to sever the tether. Following the accident, the wreckage was moved, still inverted, to a pier where it could be seen that three of the six floats were under-inflated and that two of these were on the right hand side (see the illustration below), which would have created the asymmetry which led to the roll on touchdown. It was noted that the AS350 B2 helicopter is not certified for ditching but the accident helicopter, which the operator used in both Part 135 and Part 91 flight operations, had been equipped with a Dart Aerospace STC-approved emergency flotation system which was designed so that the pilot could “pull the handle to fully deploy the floats using only the right hand (the hand operating the cyclic control) without letting go of the cyclic grip (similar to how a bicycle brake lever is operated without letting go of the handlebar)”. However, no description or illustration of the system or of the intended single-handed activation technique could be found and there was no specification of the lever force required to fully activate the system. The pilot stated that he had believed that the system was fully activated after the ‘pop’ he had heard but examination of the system found it to be have been fully serviceable when deployed but with only one of the two installed compressed nitrogen gas reservoirs having discharged its contents into the floats. Testing was able to demonstrate that the activation lever had not reached its full travel when the first ‘pop’ had occurred and that a second such ‘pop’ was likely to have occurred when the other gas reservoir discharged. It was concluded that the sequential rather than simultaneous operation of the two reservoir discharge valves in this case was a consequence of a slightly mis-positioned activation cable junction box where the activation cable was attached to the two individual reservoir valve release cables. The Findings from the Investigation as formally documented included, but were not limited to, the following: The helicopter’s landing was survivable; however, the NYONair-provided harness/tether system contributed to the passenger fatalities because it did not allow the passengers to
