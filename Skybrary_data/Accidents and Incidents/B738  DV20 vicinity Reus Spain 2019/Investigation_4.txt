controller under instruction and the instructor controller lost situational awareness of the traffic under their control”. Four Contributory Factors were also identified as follows: The provision of an inadequate VFR clearance to the DA20, in terms of the altitude to maintain, as the lower clearance limit of this clearance (3500 feet) conflicted with the ILS approach procedure which the 737 had been cleared to fly.. The non-use of available surveillance radar for traffic awareness.. The Student Controller’s placement of the strips in the holder, as well as their use of various fixes (runway, pattern, approach), differed from those normally used by the Instructor Controller.. The assignment by AESA (the Spanish Aviation Safety Agency), in coordination with ENAIRE, of an area very close to Reus Airport for display flying.. Safety Action was noted as having been taken by ANSP ENAIRE during the course of the Investigation to clarify in the AIP the situation in regarding the use of radar to provide approach control service at Reus. Three Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that ENAIRE (the State ANSP) provide refresher training to controllers at Reus on the procedure to follow in the event of a TCAS RA. [REC 01/20]. that ENAIRE establish more safety measures than the issue of a NOTAM when aerobatic flights are going to take place near an aerodrome. [REC 02/20]. that ENAIRE establish standard procedures on how to place fixes at work stations so as to ensure that all controllers place flight progress strips in the holder in the same way. [REC 03/20]. The Final Report of the Investigation was approved on 26 February 2020.
