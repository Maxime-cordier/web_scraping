On 1 August 2007, the crew of a BEECH 1900 aircraft holding on an angled taxiway at Auckland International Airport mistakenly accepted the take-off clearance for another Beech 1900 that was waiting on the runway and which had a somewhat similar call sign. The pilots of both aircraft read back the clearance. The aerodrome controller heard, but did not react to, the crossed transmissions. The holding aircraft entered the runway in front of the cleared aircraft, which had commenced its take-off. The pilots of both aircraft took avoiding action and stopped on the runway without any damage or injury. Contributory factors were the non-adherence to standard procedures for radiotelephony (RTF) use and the issue of an air traffic clearance, the use of an angled taxiway for runway entry, and the captain of the aircraft entering the runway not seeing the aircraft already lined up on the runway.
