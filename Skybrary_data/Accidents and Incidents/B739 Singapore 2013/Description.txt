On 26 May 2013, a Boeing 737-900 (PK-LHQ) being operated by Lion Air had just arrived at Singapore Changi Airport on a scheduled passenger flight. Passengers had disembarked and baggage for the next flight was being loaded during the approximately one hour turn round when the aircraft nose was suddenly moved 3.5 metres to the right by the prevailing wind during a tropical storm. Impact damage was caused to the aircraft, the attached air bridge and adjacent baggage loading equipment. None of those on board or adjacent to the aircraft were injured.
