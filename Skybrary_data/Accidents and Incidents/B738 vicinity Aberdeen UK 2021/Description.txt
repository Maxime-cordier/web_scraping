On 11 September 2021, a Boeing 737-800 (G-FDZF) being operated by TUI Airways on an international passenger flight from Palma to Aberdeen in day IMC was instructed to discontinue an ILS Cat 1 approach to runway 34 to destination but instead of climbing to and maintaining 3000 feet QNH as cleared, when it approached that altitude, a rapid descent began at an increasingly high speed towards terrain before a still high speed recovery climb was commenced at just over 1500 feet agl. The whole excursion occurred with the aircraft in cloud throughout. Once returned to the previous cleared altitude, further ATC instructions were followed and the remainder of the flight was uneventful.
