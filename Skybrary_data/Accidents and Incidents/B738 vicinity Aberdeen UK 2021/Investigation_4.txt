significant period. Both pilots had experienced significant periods away from flying the aircraft type during the pandemic. Safety Action taken prior to completion of the Investigation was noted as having included, but not been limited to, the following: TUI Airways Conducted an extensive review of pilot recency-related safety events and additional company restrictions were introduced to safely manage pilots through a period of reduced flying.. Reminded their Boeing 737 pilots that above 2,000 feet agl, a push of the TO/GA switches will provide full go-around thrust.. Advised their non-Boeing 737 pilots of the incident.. Planned to include enhanced go around training in the next recurrent simulator cycle and improve awareness and understanding of the AFDS system in GA mode and the potential consequences of exposure to two engine go-around events.. Aberdeen ATC introduced MATS 2 procedural changes in respect of aircraft being broken off from an approach after passing the final approach fix (FAF) which required them to be instructed only to make a standard missed approach unless there were “overriding safety considerations, or alternative instructions have already been issued” with headings only allocated once an aircraft is level at the missed approach altitude. Boeing amended the FCOM in respect of the first push of the TO/GA switches at or above 2000 feet agl as follows: If pushed at or above 2,000 feet RA (or below 1,500 ft if both RA’s have failed) with glideslope engaged or the flaps down: the A/T (if armed) engages in N1 mode and advances thrust towards the full go around limit. The A/T Engaged Mode annunciation on the FMA indicates N1. The Final Report was published on 18 August 2022. No Safety Recommendations were made.
