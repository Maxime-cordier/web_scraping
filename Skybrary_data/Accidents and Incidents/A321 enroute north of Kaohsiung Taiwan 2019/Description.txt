On 29 October 2019, an Airbus A321 (HL8071) being operated by Asiana Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Incheon to Kaohsiung, Taiwan as AAR717 had begun descent towards destination in night VMC when the Captain asked the First Officer to obtain the destination weather via ACARS. The First Officer submitted the request but whilst waiting for the printout, suddenly lost consciousness. Cabin crew were called to assist and having briefed them on immediate actions, the Captain declared MAYDAY. The First Officer was not fit to resume his pilot role and was removed to the passenger cabin with the Captain completing the flight operating alone with an uneventful landing 20 minutes later.
