mindset amongst its employees when it comes to fatigue management.. Four Safety Recommendations were made based on the findings of the Investigation as follows: that Asiana Airlines emphasise each crew member's responsibility to manage fatigue and provide a means of fatigue management in detail (and provide guidance on such matters as sleep debt risk, prevention of fatigue accumulation and solutions against extreme fatigue). [AIR1906-1]. that Asiana Airlines incorporate ‘condition notification’ as described in the FCTM in the Flight Operations Manual (FOM) to assist in a review of the concept of ‘safety culture’ in the organisational perspective and promote it. [AIR1906-2]. that Asiana Airlines should, considering the impact of enabling ‘controlled rest' on accident prevention, set out a policy and procedure for ‘controlled rest’ (refer to the ICAO Fatigue Management Guide for Airline Operators 2nd edition, 2015. Appendix C). [AIR1906-3]. that Asiana Airlines specifies the procedure for crew incapacitation in cabin crew manual and implements relevant training. [AIR1906-4].
