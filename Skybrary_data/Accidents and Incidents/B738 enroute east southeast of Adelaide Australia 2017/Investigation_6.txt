change.. A Flight Crew Information Bulletin (FCIB) was sent to all 737 pilots identifying that there had been many instances where pilots had manually intervened to respond to an overspeed or possible overspeed, and that several of these events had resulted in serious injuries. The FCIB noted that VMO/MMO are not 'never-exceed' speeds and that it was acceptable to refuse any instruction to conduct a high-speed descent. It also emphasised that it was preferable to accept a temporary overspeed rather than make large abrupt control inputs.. Updated procedures provided to Company ground handling staff and other Company personnel working airside require that in situations where emergency services are in attendance, their reasonable directions should be followed and if ground handling staff are in doubt, they should liaise with the Captain, SCCM or Airport Manager, as applicable.. All pilots have been provided with additional non-technical skills training to further educate pilots about the management response to flight safety events and how the Company Flight Data Analysis Program (FDAP) is run to counter any mis-perceptions.. The Final Report was released on 30 September 2020. No Safety Recommendations were made.
