A Senior First Officer acting as a supernumerary â€˜Safety Pilot' was occupying the principal flight deck observer seat. Although none of the 295 occupants were injured, substantial airframe damage was caused which rendered the aircraft un-airworthy pending repairs with some associated superficial damage to the runway surface.
