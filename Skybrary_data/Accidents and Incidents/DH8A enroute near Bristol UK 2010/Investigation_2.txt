a risk of multiple errors on critical systems when carried out at the same time as a similar task by the same personnel should be “separated by at least one flight, or carried out by different personnel, or if this cannot be achieved, a re-inspection of the work after completion of all similar tasks should be completed and worksheets annotated accordingly”. However, it was also found that engine oil cooler removal / refit was not on the list. It was also noted that awareness of the new list was limited. The Investigation also examined the long working hours recorded by maintenance personnel responsible for overseeing the ‘C’ Check and noted the considerable opportunities for the effects of fatigue to manifest themselves. Six Safety Recommendations were therefore made as a result of the Investigation to the effect that: Flybe Aviation Services revise their practices and procedures to ensure that their repair instructions are adequately detailed and specify the necessary access and removal requirements. (2011-014). Bombardier Inc. amend the Aircraft Maintenance Manual for the DHC-8-100 series aircraft to emphasise the correct procedure for securing the inlet and outlet pipes to the engine oil coolers, including the method for tightening the associated knurled nuts. (2011-015). Flybe Aviation Services review their defect rectification processes to ensure that important safety checks, such as oil leak checks, are not omitted. (2011-016). Flybe Aviation Services remind all staff of the importance of investigating the source of every engine oil leak. (2011-017). EASA expand the advisory or guidance material in Annex II (Part 145) of European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2042/2003 on how approved maintenance organisations should manage and monitor the risk of maintenance engineer fatigue as part of their requirement to take human performance limitations into account. (2011-018). The CAA include the following areas in their Part 145 audits of Flybe Aviation Services: practices and procedures for detailing repair instructions, identification of safety critical tasks, planning of defect rectification and management of maintenance engineer fatigue.
