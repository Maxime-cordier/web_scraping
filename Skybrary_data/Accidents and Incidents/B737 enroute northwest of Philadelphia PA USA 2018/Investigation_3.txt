that impact of others with the fan case had caused local deformation in it over a short period of time which had then been propagated both around and forward/aft of the fan case. After reaching the aircraft structure via the inlet attach ring, this deformation had generated large loads that resulted in local damage to the intake and, together with the forward-travelling fan blade fragments, compromised the structural integrity of the intake and caused parts of it to depart the aircraft. The extent of collateral damage consequent upon the failure of a single fan blade during the accident sequence was found to have exceeded the assumptions made during type certification dependent on the results of FBO debris containment modelling insofar as the fan blade fragments travelling forward of the fan case in the event under investigation had a trajectory angle that was greater than that observed during this work. The extent of intake damage caused by these blade fragments was also greater than that observed during the same certification assessments which had not adequately accounted for FBO-generated loads transmitted to the fan cowl through the radial restraint fitting and had resulted in them not being accounted for in the design of the fan cowl. It was, however, recognised that since certification of the CFM56-7B engine in December 1996 and the 737-700 airframe in December 1997, “new technologies and analytical methods have been developed that will better predict the interaction of the engine and airframe during an FBO event and the response of the inlet, fan cowl and associated aircraft structures”. It was noted that after the similar 737-700 FBO event in August 2016, engine manufacturer CFM International had developed an Eddy Current Inspection (ECI) procedure to be carried out during overhaul of CFM56-7B engines in addition to the FPI already required. It was also noted that unlike an FPI, which can only detect surface cracks, an ECI has a higher sensitivity and can also detect cracks near to as well as at the surface. CFM had also responded to this earlier event by developing an on-wing ultrasonic inspection process which could be carried out at the same time as fan blade re-lubrication. It was noted that although the failed blade had not been subjected to these additional inspection processes - nor had it been required to be - where used they had identified 15 blade cracks on separate engines as of August 2019. The Investigation noted that whilst the performance of appropriate Checklists according to SOPs is a critical part of safe flight operations, given the emergency situation aboard the accident flight, the performance by the experienced flight crew of most, but not all, of the items in the ‘Engine Fire or Engine Severe Damage or Separation’ Non-normal Checklist and the non-performance of the three other relevant Non-normal Checklists had nevertheless “allowed the crew to appropriately balance the procedural requirement of executing checklists with the high workload associated with maintaining aircraft control” whilst completing a safe and timely emergency descent
