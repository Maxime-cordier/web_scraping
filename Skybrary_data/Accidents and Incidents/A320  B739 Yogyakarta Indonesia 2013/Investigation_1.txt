An Investigation was carried out by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee. Data from the A320 FDR was successfully downloaded and available to assist the Investigation. It was noted that the 60 year old Captain of the A320 with 20,000 flying hours including 500 on the A320 was accompanied by a 25 year old First Officer with 3100 flying hours, almost all on the A320. The A320 was instructed by TWR to taxi to the Holding Point for Runway 27 via the N2 taxiway. The pilot advised the Investigation that he thought that the intended Holding Point was located near to the runway 27 threshold and that taxiing to the N3 taxiway was the best way to reach it without entering the runway. On request, TWR re-confirmed that the clearance was via taxiway N2 but the Commander appeared to have then assumed that this clearance included entry to the runway in order to backtrack to the Holding Point. However he then failed to clarify this assumption with TWR and since his aircraft was the only traffic to communicate with TWR during the taxi out, he "assumed that there was no aircraft on approach". As he taxied across the N2 Holding Point, the Commander of the A320 saw an aircraft on final approach to Runway 09 and immediately stopped his aircraft as TWR simultaneously instructed him to hold position. FDR data from the A320 showed that the nose of the aircraft was 16 metres past the Holding Point. The APP controller had previously informed the 737 that the runway was clear of traffic and issued a landing clearance subject to the runway being in sight. The 737 pilot reported runway in sight with 3.5 nm to go and the APP controller re-issued the landing clearance and instructed the pilot to contact TWR after landing. After observing that the A320 had entered the runway and that the 737 was at about 600 feet on final approach, TWR requested APP to instruct the 737 to go around. However, the APP controller "perceived that a go around when an aircraft was on short final might jeopardise the safety of the flight" and did not do so. Realising that the 737 was continuing its approach, TWR instructed it to make a go around but there was no response. It was considered likely that the 737 was still monitoring the APP frequency given that they had been told to contact TWR only after landing. The Landing Distance Required by the 737 was found to have been between 1467 metres and 2016 metres depending on braking action; the actual landing distance used was approximately 1650 metres. The Commander of the 737 subsequently reported that he had been able to see the runway from approximately 1500 feet and had also seen an aircraft taxi out to N2. Then, just after touching down, he reported having seen that the A320 was on taxiway N2 but that the nose of the aircraft was protruding onto the runway. He had then
