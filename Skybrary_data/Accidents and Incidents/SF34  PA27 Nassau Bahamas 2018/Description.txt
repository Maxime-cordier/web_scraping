On 22 September 2018, a Saab 340B (C6-KID) being operated by Western Air as WST 701 on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Nassau to Freeport came very close to a mid air collision with a privately operated Piper PA27 (C6-JEF) overhead the main runway. The Piper was on a domestic VFR flight from Nassau to Great Harbour Cay. The near mid-air collision occured after the two aircraft begun their takeoffs simultaneously from opposite ends of the same runway in day VMC. Neither aircraft crew sighted the aircraft and the PA27 passed over the Saab 340 shortly after the latter had become airborne.
