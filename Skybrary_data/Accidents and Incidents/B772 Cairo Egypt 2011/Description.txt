On 29 July 2011, a Boeing 777-200 being operated by EgyptAir on a scheduled passenger flight to Jeddah was parked on the departure gate whilst awaiting the last few passengers and completion of hold loading when a fire suddenly began at the lower right hand side of the flight deck. Despite prompt attempts to extinguish the fire, it continued to burn out of control causing major structural damage to the front of the aircraft. However, all 317 occupants were safely evacuated using the still-attached air bridge access at doors 1L and 2L.
