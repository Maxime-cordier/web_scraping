The TCAS RA stemmed from the unintentional entry of the airliner into Spadeadam Range as a result of the avoiding action issued by Newcastle RADAR whereupon the DHC-8 crew detected the presence of the jet whilst the GR4 crew were actively avoiding the airliner. The Board therefore concluded that the Cause of this Airprox was a sighting report (TCAS) with no inherent Risk of a Collision.
