On 13 October 2008, a DHC-8 Q400 was on heading 056 inbound to Newcastle and in receipt of Radar Advisory Service in Class 'G' Airspace. It was rerouted to avoid Spadeadam Danger Area (EGD510), which was active with an extended vertical limit as published by Notice To Airmen. Approximately 24 nm west of Newcastle, the aircraft was instructed by Newcastle RADAR to stop descent and turn left 010 as Avoiding Action because of unknown traffic passing from right to left and climbing from below the current altitude of the DHC-8. A TCAS TA then occurred followed quickly by a TCAS RA to DESCEND. This was followed and the ATC left turn instruction then acknowledged. After the DHC-8 turned left onto 010 there was another TCAS TA. The ATC avoiding action had resulted in the DHC-8 entering the Danger Area EGD510. The unknown traffic turned out to be a Tornado GR4 fast jet operating as part of a four aircraft formation. The formation was in receipt of a radar information service from a fighter controller aboard an E3 AWACS aircraft and then was asked to ‘contact’ Spadeadam Range Control. No ATC handover took place between the AWACS and Spadeadam radar controller nor did the AWACS inform the Tornados that their flight information service (FIS) was terminated. The Spadeadam radar controller provided traffic information to the Tormado formation about the DHC-8 as soon as it came on the frequency despite the fact that the crew advised that they were receiving ‘service’ from the AWACS. Neither TCAS nor any other form of collision warning system was fitted on the military jets.
