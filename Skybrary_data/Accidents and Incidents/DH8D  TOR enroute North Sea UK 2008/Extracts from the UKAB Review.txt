"Service provided by the control team on the AWACS to the Tornado formation during this Exercise would have been limited generally to tactical information about the Exercise mission;. The absence of a formal termination of the FIS provided by the Air Defense controller would not be unusual once the jets were inbound to their target area within the confines of the Spadeadam Danger Area;. A ‘contract’ had evidently not been established with Spadeadam for a radar service and the Spadeadam Air traffic controller (SPD) had endeavored to clarify this point at an early stage;. It was clear that SPD astutely provided accurate and pertinent traffic information to ensure that the GR4 crew was kept closely updated over what was happening so that they might spot the airliner at the earliest opportunity;. For their part, the GR4 crew had obtained Range entry clearance and were plainly endeavoring to steer clear of the DHC-8 whilst still trying to salvage their Exercise attack run which needed a fairly precise set-up;. Clearly the avoiding action instruction to the DHC-8 crew that resulted in their entry into the danger area unannounced was unwise, but controller […] (representatives) were aware that Newcastle RADAR had little room to manoeuvre so close to the boundary of the Danger Area..
