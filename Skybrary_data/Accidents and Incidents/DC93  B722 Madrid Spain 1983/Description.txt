On 7 December 1983, a Boeing 727-200 (EC-CFJ) being operated by Iberia on a scheduled passenger flight from Madrid to Rome Fiumicino as IB 350 collided in thick fog in daylight with a Douglas DC-9-30 (EC-CGS) being operated by Aviaco on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Madrid to Santander as AO 134. Both aircraft caught fire immediately after the impact and both were subsequently destroyed. All 42 occupants of the DC-9 were killed as were 51 of the occupants of the 727 with 42 others on board the latter surviving with unspecified levels of injury. There was also extensive consequential damage to the runway surface and signage.
