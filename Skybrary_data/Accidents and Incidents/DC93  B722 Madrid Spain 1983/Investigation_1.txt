An Investigation was carried out by the Spanish Civil Aviation Accident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC). FDR data as recovered from both aircraft and CVR data was recovered from the 727, The DC-9 was not fitted with a CVR and because of grandfather rights was not required to be. The usefulness of the FDR data was limited by the small number of parameters recorded on the metallic tape mechanism used by both of them. Extraction of data from the DC-9 FDR was difficult and required special methods. The 54 year-old DC-9 Captain had 13,442 hours total flying experience which included 7,512 hours on type. The 39 year-old DC-9 First Officer had 18,322 hours total flying experience including 3,655 hours on type. The 43 year-old Boeing 727 Captain had 8,868 hours total flying experience which included 1,919 hours on type. The 41 year-old Boeing 727 First Officer had 3,474 hours total flying experience including 2,848 hours on type. It was established that runways 01 and 33 were in use but as the latter was designated for landings only, it was unused because the RVR was below that for which landings were permitted. Runway 01/19 was 3,700 metres long and 45 metres wide and was equipped with high intensity edge, centreline, threshold and end of runway lights. All taxiways were 30.5 metres wide and were equipped with edge lighting and centreline markings. Runway holding points were marked but without any associated pavement lighting. The METARs for the period prior to the accident and immediately after it all recorded a visibility of 100-200 metres in fog with the sky obscured, the wind calm and the temperature and dew point both 0°C. After 0800 - the collision occurred just after 0839 - the recorded RVRs which were measured at the threshold of each runway and at their intersection were all in the range 250-300 metres. The Investigation found that the DC-9 crew had received engine start approval and correctly acknowledged their taxi clearance nine minutes prior to the accident. With the Captain as PF, the correctly-acknowledged clearance involved leaving the parking area with two left turns which were followed and which brought the aircraft to a five-way junction - see the diagram below. At this point, the clearance to follow the Oscar taxiway required a 90° right turn onto taxiway 'O7' which led directly via 'O6' to 'O5' and the full length holding point for runway 01 with a position check entering 'O5' being requested as part of the clearance. However, having tracked slightly to the right of the taxiway centreline as this junction was approached, the aircraft had taken a lesser turn to the right onto taxiway J1. It had then continued to follow the centreline of this taxiway until it split into two as it reached the intersection of the two runways, where it took the right turn onto runway 01/19 so as to face in the 19 direction. Initially (see the second diagram below), the aircraft was at the side of the runway
