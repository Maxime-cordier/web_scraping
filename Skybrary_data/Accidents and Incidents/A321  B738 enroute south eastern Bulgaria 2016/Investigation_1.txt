After the classification of the event as a Serious Incident by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) of the Aircraft, Maritime and Railway Accident Investigation Unit Directorate at the Bulgarian Ministry of Transport, Information Technology and Communications, an Investigation Commission was appointed by the Minister. Recorded ATC data from Sofia ACC including Mode ‘S’ downlink data was available to inform the Investigation and the FDR data of both aircraft involved were also available. It was found that the 56 year-old A321 Captain had 12,150 total flying hours and the 33 year-old A321 First Officer had only 337 total flying hours. The 43 year-old B737 Captain had 2,954 total flying hours and the 40 year-old B737 First Officer had 2,437 total flying hours. No aircraft type experience was recorded for any of the pilots. It was established that both aircraft were heading towards Istanbul and cleared to route through Bulgarian airspace towards the Bulgarian/Turkish waypoint at RILEX with similar estimates at FL370 on track T391 (the Boeing 737) and FL350 on track T390 (the Airbus A321) - see the illustration below. When the A321 was given and acknowledged a descent clearance from FL 350 to FL310, and could be seen from Mode S download to have set the new level on the FMU altitude selector, it began to climb instead. Forty seconds later, with the two aircraft 1.6nm and 1,600 feet apart, an STCA activation occurred due to their proximity as the A321 climbed towards the 737 which was at FL370. In response to this, the Controller issued a descent clearance to the 737 to FL 350 and then FL 330 but received no reply. By this time, the A321 was already climbing through FL 357 at 1,500 fpm with the tracks of the two aircraft 1.5 nm apart and closing. Nine seconds later a TCAS TA was generated on the A321 which continued for 44 seconds without any TCAS RA following. Thirteen seconds after this, prescribed traffic separation was lost and after a further four seconds as both aircraft were passing FL 363 and 1.2 nm apart horizontally, the controller instructed the A321 to turn left 30° and the 737 to turn right 30°. Neither aircraft acknowledged these instructions but both turned. Then approximately 20 seconds after the 737 crew had received their turn right instruction and as they were descending though FL 359, a preventive TCAS RA was annunciated on their flight deck to ‘Monitor Vertical Speed’ with no climb permitted and lasted 2 seconds. The TCAS TA on the A321 ceased two seconds after the RA on the 737 and ‘Clear of Conflict’ followed on the 737 as the aircraft was passing FL 359. Finally, after a further 16 seconds, the A321 selected vertical speed was corrected from a climb to a descent and after 1 minute 25 seconds, it reached its cleared level of FL 310 with the crew claiming that a “technical problem” was the reason for their altitude deviation.
