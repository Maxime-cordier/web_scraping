On 27 August 2006, a Bombardier CRJ100 (N431CA) being operated by Comair on a scheduled passenger flight from Lexington KY to Atlanta GA as flight 5191 attempted to take off in normal night visibility from unlit runway 26 instead of runway 22 as cleared. The length of runway 26 was insufficient and the aircraft overran and was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire. All but one of the 50 occupants died - the First Officer survived with serious injuries.
