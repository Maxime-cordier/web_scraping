On 30 August 2016, a Boeing 777-300 (VT-JEK) being operated by Jet Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight departing from London Heathrow runway 27L for Mumbai as JAI 117 in night VMC was observed to only just get airborne after commencing takeoff from an intersection rather than using the full length of the runway. After achieving minimal initial ground clearance, the aircraft climbed away normally and continued uneventfully to its destination.
