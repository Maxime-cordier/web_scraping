On 1 November 2011, the crew of a Boeing 767-300 (SP-LPC) being operated by LOT Polish Airlines on an international passenger flight from Newark to Warsaw as LOT 16 were unable to extend the landing gear using either the alternate or free fall systems after the normal system had been disabled soon after takeoff due to a partial hydraulic system failure. After an ‘emergency’ had been declared, a daylight VMC approach was followed by a belly landing which resulted in the right engine catching fire. The aircraft was stopped on the runway and the engine fire was quickly controlled and a successful evacuation of all 231 occupants accomplished.
