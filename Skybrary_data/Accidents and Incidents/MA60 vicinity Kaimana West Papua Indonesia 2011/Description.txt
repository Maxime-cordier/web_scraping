On 7 May 2011, a Xian MA60 being operated by Merpati Nusantara AL on a scheduled passenger flight from Sorong to Kaimana failed to complete an attempted day visual approach to runway 01 at destination when control was lost shortly after an attempted transition to a go around due to lack of sufficient visual reference. The aircraft was destroyed on impact with the sea surface 800 metres south west of the runway threshold at a high rate of descent and all 25 occupants were killed.
