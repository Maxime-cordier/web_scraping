On 2 October 2015, a USAF C130J-30 Hercules (Tail Number 08-3174) being operated on a multi leg scheduled contingency airlift mission pre-assessed as 'low risk' and departing Jalalabad for Bagram adopted an increasingly steep climb angle after becoming airborne at night in VMC. After reaching approximately 700 feet agl, it stalled and descended rapidly, impacting terrain within the aerodrome at a high rate of descent after just 28 seconds airborne. The aircraft was completely destroyed and all 11 occupants were killed as were 3 Afghan military personnel in an aerodrome guard tower which was hit by the aircraft.
