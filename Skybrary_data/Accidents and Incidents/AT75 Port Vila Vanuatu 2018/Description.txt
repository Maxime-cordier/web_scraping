On 28 July 2018, an ATR72-500 (YJ-AV71) being operated by Air Vanuatu on a domestic passenger flight from Tanna to Port Vila. during which type conversion line training for the First Officer was being performed, suffered a sudden failure of the right engine that reportedly led to significant smoke appearing in the passenger cabin. A MAYDAY was declared on that account but an apparently unrelated landing accident subsequently occurred when the aircraft veered off the destination landing runway soon after touchdown and collided with two unoccupied parked aircraft. All three aircraft were damaged, but no occupants on the in-service aircraft were injured.
