On 29 March 2019, a GEnx-1B powered Boeing 787-8 (VH-VKJ) being operated by Jetstar Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Cairns Australia to Kansai as JQ15 experienced the successive indications of uncommanded but transient complete rundowns of both engines during descent to destination in day VMC. While engine instruments continued to indicate continuing engine control issues, sufficient thrust remained available to complete the intended flight.
