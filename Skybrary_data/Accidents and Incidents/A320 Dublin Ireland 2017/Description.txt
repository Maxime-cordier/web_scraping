On 27 September 2017, an Airbus A320 (EC-LVQ) being operated by Iberia Express on a scheduled international passenger flight from Dublin to Madrid was hit by the tug, which was manoeuvring it off gate 318R onto apron taxiway 5 in normal day visibility from where taxiing could commence, when the tow bar shear pin failed. As a result of this, the driver lost control and the tug then collided with the aircraft right engine causing damage to both the tug and the aircraft but no ground crew injuries.
