to exceed the limitations for manoeuvring an A320 aircraft whilst under tow.. The ramp conditions were wet and there was a downhill slope of approximately 1% on the pull forward section of the manoeuvre, the latter being within aerodrome design specifications.. During the pull forward, the aircraft’s right engine was started but the estimated resultant thrust from the engine did not exceed idle thrust.. The documented procedures of the ground handling company who were performing the tow stated that towing with any engine running was prohibited.. The failure of the shear-pin towards the end of the planned full forward manoeuvre was not attributable to any aspect of the manoeuvre. Once the shear-pin had failed, the driver was no longer able to control the movement of the aircraft.. Although neither the slope on the ramp, the engine start, nor the wet surface conditions caused the shear-pin to fail, once it had failed, these factors probably contributed to the severity of the outcome.. The Probable Cause of the Serious Incident was determined as “failure of the towbar shear-pin during a pull forward manoeuvre”. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Swissport Ground Handling should ensure that all (their) ground crews are made aware of, and follow, the correct manoeuvring procedures at Dublin Airport.
