On 21 June 2018, an Airbus 220-300 (YL-CSC) being operated by Air Baltic on a scheduled international passenger flight from Geneva to Riga as BTI7QX left the runway soon after touchdown at destination in normal day visibility from its third approach. It then regained the runway but stopped when deflation of a nose landing gear tyre and damage to runway edge lighting were initially suspected and then confirmed. The aircraft was eventually shut down and towed in to its allocated stand for passenger disembarkation.
