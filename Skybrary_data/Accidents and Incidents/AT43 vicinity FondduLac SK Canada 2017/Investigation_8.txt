pilot training programme has been introduced with simulator modules on flight in icing conditions now increased from one to two and classroom time spent on cold weather operations also increased. Both initial and recurrent simulator training now include a severe airframe icing scenario with reduced aircraft controllability, contaminated runway performance requirements and the use of icing speeds. ATR-approved procedures based on the manufacturer’s FCOM are now used as the source for aircraft contamination inspections including identification of the need for additional inspections.. Cabin crew are now being trained to initiate “brace” instructions on their own initiative in the event of unusual attitudes during a critical phase of flight such as takeoff or landing.. New procedures to more actively oversee aircraft maintenance procedures have been introduced.. The Final Report of the Investigation, some 240 pages in length, was authorised for release on 2 June 2021 but not officially released until 28 October 2021. No further Safety Recommendations were made in the Report.
