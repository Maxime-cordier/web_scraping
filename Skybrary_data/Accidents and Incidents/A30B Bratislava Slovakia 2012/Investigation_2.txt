on its axle, the nose gear bogie began to shimmy, which made the aeroplane veer to the left. The aeroplane exited the runway and the nose gear collapsed during the collision with a concrete inspection pit for access to the runway lighting electric cables. The runway excursion was due to the incorrect and undetected re-assembly of the nose gear torque links. Despite the presence of a detailed diagram, the absence of clear and detailed instructions in the text of the manufacturerâ€™s AMM, allowing the operator to ensure that the assembly was correct, contributed to the incorrect assembly. The failure of the nose gear was due to the collision with an obstacle in the runway strip. The absence of any regulation requiring that equipment in the immediate vicinity of a runway or of a runway overrun area be designed so as to limit as much as possible any damage to aeroplanes, in case of a runway excursion, contributed to the accident. Safety Action taken by Airbus and reported to the Investigation included the provision to operators on 3 April 2013 to A300/A300-600/A310/AST operators of recommendations on the maintenance of the nose gear steering torque link assembly, in particular the importance of correct assembly of the washers on the nose landing gear (NLG) torque link centre hinge. This communication advised that a corresponding amendment would be made to section 32-21-15 of the Aircraft Maintenance Manual at the next revision. It is understood that the NLG Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Messier-Bugatti-Dowty also intends to similarly amend the CMM. After initial publication in French in September 2013, the Final Report in English Translation was published the following month. No Safety Recommendations were made.
