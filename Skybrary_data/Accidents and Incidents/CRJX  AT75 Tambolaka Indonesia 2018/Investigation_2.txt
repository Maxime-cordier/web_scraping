control clearance, the ACO responded by first getting another position report from the inbound aircraft and was told they were 14 nm out and crossing the 096° radial from Tambolaka passing 8,000 feet and confirmed that they would join downwind left for runway 10. The ACO then transmitted “Garuda 460, cleared to Kupang level 250 squawk 5615, runway is clear” and after readback and confirmation that the departing aircraft was aware of the inbound traffic, the CRJ1000 called that it was “rolling for takeoff”. The inbound aircraft responded that it had noted this and was joining downwind left for runway 10 with “the runway in sight via coastline” and the CRJ1000 responded with a request that they call downwind. Shortly after this, the CRJ1000 reached about 600 feet on the extended runway centreline and began a left turn. One minute after this turn had been commenced the ATR72 received a TCAS RA ‘DON’T DESCEND’ against the CRJ1000 when the two aircraft were 1.8nm laterally and 660 feet vertically apart. The inbound ATR72 was making a gentle right turn and passing a heading of approximately 290° and the outbound CRJ1000 was making a gentle left turn and passing a heading of approximately 020°. Two seconds later, as the ATR72 began to level off, its RA changed to ‘CLIMB’ and the CRJ1000 AP was disconnected and one second after this, the CRJ1000 received a ‘DESCEND’ RA. The minimum vertical separation of 428 feet was reached three seconds later (in the positions marked on the illustration below as 1452:55) when the two aircraft were 1.3 nm apart and the CRJ1000 was just beginning its TCAS descent. Three seconds later, the ATR72 RA ceased after lasting 9 seconds but the CRJ1000 RA continued for a further 40 seconds until it had descended 400 feet. FDR position coordinates from the two aircraft were used to calculate the separation between the two aircraft as the conflict developed and was resolved. The following illustration superimposes the FDR data on a Google Earth map. The annotated ground tracks of the two flights. [Reproduced from the Official Report] The Investigation noted that: The CRJ1000 First Officer either failed to recognise that the Captain’s statements about the inbound aircraft joining downwind right hand were contrary to the ATR72 crew’s three broadcasts of their intention to join downwind left hand, the third of which he had specifically and correctly acknowledged, or for some reason consciously did not correct him.. the CRJ1000 pilots’ Navigation Displays (ND) on which traffic visible to TCAS is displayed would have shown the relative position and altitude of the inbound ATR72 to the left / north side of the CRJ1000 initial climb after takeoff were such that the subsequent left turn and climb would have clearly taken the aircraft into potential conflict with it.. in continuing to perform the flying duty during which the event occurred, it was clear that the CRJ1000 Captain “did not consider that his medical condition might degrade his performance”.. It was considered
