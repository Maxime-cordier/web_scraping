On 11 May 2018, a Bombardier CRJ1000 (PK-GRJ) being operated by Garuda Indonesia on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Tambolaka to Kupang as GIA460 and an ATR72-500 (PK-WFW) being operated by Wings Air on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from El Tari to Tambolaka as WON1921 lost safe separation in day VMC within Class ‘G’ airspace in which only Flight Information Service was provided. A coordinated TCAS RA resulted and was followed by both aircraft and the conflict was thereby avoided. The minimum vertical separation was 428 feet when 1.3 nm apart laterally.
