Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Aerodrome Operator should look into having a system that can clearly indicate to all working in the bay and adjacent areas the operational status of a bay. (R-2015-005). that the Airline Operator should remind its flight crews that if the view of the hatch lines of the PLB safety zone or the wheels of the aerobridge were obscured, it could suggest an abnormal situation in the ERA. (R-2015-006). that the Ground Service Provider (responsible for the operation of the gate area during the arrival of the incident aircraft) review its procedures to ensure that there will be continuous surveillance of the parking bays by its arrival crews until the aircraft arrive. (R-2015-007). The Final Report of the Investigation was published on 30 July 2015.
