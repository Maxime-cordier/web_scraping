On 19 December 2013, a Boeing 777-200 (9V-SRP) being operated by Singapore Airlines in a scheduled passenger flight from Mumbai to Singapore ingested an empty cargo container into the left engine as it taxied onto the designated arrival gate at Terminal 2 at Singapore with normal daylight visibility. The engine sustained serious damage and had to be replaced. No persons on the aircraft or on the ground were injured.
