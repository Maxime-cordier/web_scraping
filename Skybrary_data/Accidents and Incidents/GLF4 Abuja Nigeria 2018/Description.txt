On 12 September 2018, a Gulfstream G-IV (5N-BOD) being operated by SkyBird Air on a non-revenue domestic positioning flight from Lagos to Abuja overran the 3610 metre-long runway 22 at destination after touchdown following an ILS approach in night VMC and finally stopped in mud approximately 70 metres beyond its end. None of the six occupants were injured but two approach lights were impact-damaged by the aircraft landing gear and aircraft right hand flap was damaged by debris impact during the overrun.
