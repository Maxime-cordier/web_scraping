On 22 December 2013, a Boeing 747-400 (G-BNLL) being operated by British Airways on a scheduled passenger flight from Johannesburg to London Heathrow was taxiing for departure at night in normal ground visibility when the aircraft was involved in a collision with a building adjacent to the taxiway. Substantial damage to both aircraft and building resulted and a significant fuel leak occurred. The aircraft occupants were all uninjured but four people in the building sustained minor injuries.
