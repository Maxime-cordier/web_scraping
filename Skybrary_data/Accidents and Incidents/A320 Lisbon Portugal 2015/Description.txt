On 19 May 2015, an Airbus A320 (OO-SNB) being operated by Brussels Airlines on a scheduled international passenger flight from Brussels to Lisbon as SN 3815 was taxied into the allocated stand at destination in normal ground visibility by following the guidance provided by the Aircraft Positioning and Information System (APIS) but its left wing collided with the airbridge before any ‘stop’ instruction had been annunciated on the APIS. Damage was caused to the left engine intake cowl and some intake fan blades and to the airbridge but there were no injuries to the 150 occupants or any other persons. The aircraft was pushed back and passengers were disembarked via the 2L door using external airstairs.
