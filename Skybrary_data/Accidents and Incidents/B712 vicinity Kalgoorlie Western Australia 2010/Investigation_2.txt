as part of the initial licence endorsement of the aircraft type, there was no provision for corresponding recurrency training to validate their ongoing competency. The Findings of the Investigation included the identification of four ‘Safety Issues’ as follows: The presentation on the aircraft load sheet of the zero fuel weight immediately below the operating weight increased the risk of flight crew selecting the inappropriate figure for flight management system data entry.. The operator's procedure for confirming the validity of the flight management system generated take-off weight did not place sufficient emphasis on the check against the load sheet.. The operator’s procedures did not include a validation check of the landing weight generated by the flight management system, which resulted in a lack of assurance that the approach and landing speeds were valid.. The operator’s recurrent training programs did not address the recovery from a stall or stickshaker activation such that the ongoing competency of their flight crew was not assured.. The Final Report of the Investigation: Aviation Occurrence AO-2010-081 was published on 9 February 2012. No Safety Recommendations were made but safety action intended or taken by the Operator was noted.
