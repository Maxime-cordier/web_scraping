On 4 August 2014, a Boeing 737-300 (C-GICN) being operated by Canadian North on a passenger flight from Winnipeg to Fort McMurray as MPE9131 made a visual approach to a taxiway parallel to the main runway at destination after accepting an ILS approach and began a very low go around only after being prompted to do so by the crew of a Bombardier DHC8-400 being operated as Air Canada Jazz JZA391 which was taxiing in the opposite direction on the same taxiway. The recorded CPA was 230 feet vertically and 46 feet laterally.
