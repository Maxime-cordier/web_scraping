the instability of the approach was not identified, and a go-around was not conducted.. Risk If crews do not rigorously adhere to procedures that facilitate the monitoring of all available cues during the approach and landing, there is an increased likelihood of over-reliance on visual cues in the late stages of the approach, which increases the risks associated with visual illusions and unstable approaches.. If standards do not provide detailed guidance on the geometry to be used in taxiway-end design, taxiways with squared-off ends risk looking like runways, which can contribute to perceptual confusion in flight crews.. If occurrences are not reported as per the Transportation Safety Board Regulations, there is a risk that data (e.g., cockpit voice recorder data) may be lost, and, with it, the opportunity to identify safety deficiencies.. Safety Action taken as a result of the Investigation was noted to have included the following: The Fort McMurray Airport Authority issued a NOTAM to caution against confusing Taxiway J with Runway 07/25 pending a corresponding amendment to the AIP and a similar alert will be included in the ATIS until the caution is published in the next revision of NAV CANADAâ€™s 'Canada Flight Supplement'.. NAV CANADA (ANSP) added to similar caution to the Fort McMurray Aerodrome Chart and communicated with the Canadian Meteorological Service to prioritise the updating of the TWR Visibility Chart.. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 23 September 2015 and officially released on 4 November 2015. No Safety Recommendations were made.
