On 21 December 2015, the airspeed indications on a Boeing 787-8 (VH-VKE) being operated by Jetstar Airways on a scheduled passenger flight from Melbourne to Singapore as flight 007 became erratic in day IMC and reversion to manual flight path control resulted. Although normal airspeed indications were subsequently restored, the autopilot could not be re-engaged and so it was decided that with approximately four hours of flight time remaining, a diversion to Darwin was appropriate and this was accomplished without further event.
