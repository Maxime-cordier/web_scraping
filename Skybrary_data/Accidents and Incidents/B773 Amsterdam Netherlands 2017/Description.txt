On 21 April 2017, a Boeing 777-300 (VT-JEW) being operated by Jet Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Amsterdam to Toronto as 9W234 had just taken off from runway 18C in day VMC when it became evident that a tail strike may have occurred. After fuel dumping and return, this was confirmed although the runway contact was not sufficient to compromise the structural integrity of the aircraft.
