action on propeller lock disengagement procedure - the throttle levers were not pulled fully to the REVERSE position until torque had begun to increase, leaving the RH propeller starting latches in the engaged position with this condition unnoticed by the pilots and resulting in asymmetric thrust when applying take off power". Two Contributory Factors were also identified: Neither of the pilots tried to stop the aircraft exiting the runway by applying the brakes.. The fact that there is no indication in the cockpit with regards to the position of starting latches has caused pilots to develop and use multiple unofficial procedures to determine the condition of a propeller.. One Safety Recommendation was made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that Avies should, when operating aircraft with single acting propellers with starting lock systems, develop and implement procedures to determine starting lock position and to stabilise the aircraft before applying take off power.. The Final Report was completed during 2014 and made available in English in January 2017.
