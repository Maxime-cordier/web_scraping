On 28 October 2013, a BAe Jetstream 31 (SE-FVP) being operated by Avies on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Kärdla to Tallinn Estonia veered off the side of the 1520 metre-long runway 14 after take-off power was set for departure in normal day visibility. The aircraft was observed to continue a right turn through more than 180° on the grass before slowing down and turning to the left and onto the apron where it stopped and the 17 passengers were disembarked.
