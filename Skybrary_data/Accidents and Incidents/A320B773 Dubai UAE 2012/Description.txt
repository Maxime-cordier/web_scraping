On 20 March 2012, an Airbus A320-200 being operated by Ural Airlines on a passenger flight from Krasnodar, Russia to Dubai failed to comply with its issued taxi clearance after vacating runway 12L at destination and, in a forward visibility reduced by blowing dust but still around 1000 metres, taxied past an intersection holding point for the parallel runway 12R as a Boeing 777-300ER being operated by Emirates Airline on a scheduled passenger service from Dubai to Hamburg was about to pass that intersection at very high speed on take off. The A320 then stopped just before entering the runway.
