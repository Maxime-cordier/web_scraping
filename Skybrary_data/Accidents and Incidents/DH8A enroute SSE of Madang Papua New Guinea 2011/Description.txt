A 'MAYDAY' was declared and the aircraft was manoeuvred for a forced landing which was accomplished on relatively flat terrain but concealed boulders resulted in the tail and one wing separating from the fuselage and a severe fuel-fed fire started. The aircraft was destroyed and all but one of the 29 passengers died in the fire. The remaining passenger, the flight attendant and both pilots survived, the passenger with severe burns and the others with relatively minor injuries.
