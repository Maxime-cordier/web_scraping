Minimizing Hazards Caused by Uncontained Turbine Engine and Auxiliary Power Unit Rotor Failure”, had been revised and re-issued in 1997 after the 1989 uncontained engine failure accident to a United Airlines DC 10 at Sioux City and that the FAA had recently advised that a further revision and re-issue, prompted particularly by the 2010 Qantas Airbus A380 uncontained engine failure climbing out of Singapore, was expected to be issued in draft form by the end of 2018. It was noted that “during the 20 years since (the revised version of) AC 20-128 was issued, the NTSB has investigated, participated in the investigation of, or become aware of at least 40 uncontained rotor burst events” in addition to the A380 one. It was particularly noted that although the Boeing 767 in the event being investigated satisfied the design guidance in that AC aimed at preventing fuel being liberated by uncontained engine debris wing damage, this had not prevented a serious fuel-fed fire beginning almost as soon as wing damage had occurred. It was also noted that a fire of similar origin which had occurred during an engineering ground run at Philadelphia in 2000, also demonstrated that there was a clear need for modified design guidance to achieve the intended prevention of fuel-fed fires arising from uncontained engine failure damage. The Probable Cause of the accident was determined as “the failure of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) stage 2 disk, which severed the main engine fuel feed line and breached the right main wing fuel tank, releasing fuel that resulted in a fire on the right side of the airplane during the takeoff roll. The HPT stage 2 disk failed because of low-cycle fatigue cracks that initiated from an internal subsurface manufacturing anomaly that was most likely not detectable during production inspections and subsequent in-service inspections using the procedures in place.” Two Contributory Factors were also identified in respect of the serious passenger injury which occurred during the emergency evacuation: the delay in shutting down the left engine which was contributed to by: the lack of a separate checklist procedure for Boeing 767 airplanes that specifically addressed engine fires on the ground and the lack of communication between the flight and cabin crews after the airplane came to a stop;. the lack of a separate checklist procedure for Boeing 767 airplanes that specifically addressed engine fires on the ground and. the lack of communication between the flight and cabin crews after the airplane came to a stop;. a flight attendant’s deviation from company procedures, which resulted in passengers evacuating from the left overwing exit while the left engine was still operating.. A total of 9 Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows: that the Federal Aviation Administration should establish and lead an industry group that evaluates current and enhanced inspection technologies regarding their appropriateness and effectiveness for applications using nickel alloys, and use the results of this evaluation to issue guidance pertaining to the inspection process for nickel
