On 24 November 2016, a Dassault Falcon 7X (VQ-BSO) being operated privately on a passenger flight from Rotterdam to London City was taxiing in to its assigned destination parking position after landing when, whilst following marshalling instructions, its right winglet collided with the nose of another aircraft parked on the adjacent stand in normal day visibility. There were no injuries to the 4 occupants of the aircraft or to any other persons but significant damage was caused to the radome and radar antenna of the stationary aircraft. The taxiing aircraft winglet sustained only minor abrasions.
