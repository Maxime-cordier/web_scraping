On 25 February 2017, an Airbus A320 (C-FDRP) being operated by Air Canada on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Halifax to Toronto as flight 62 made a night Cat 1 ILS approach in reduced visibility due to rain which resulted in a late touchdown near the edge of the 60 metre-wide 2,770 metre-long runway 15R. The aircraft subsequently departed the runway onto the adjacent grass. It then paralleled the runway for over half its length before regaining it and coming to a stop. After the engines had been shut down and inspection showed that there was damage to the landing gear and engines, passengers were disembarked to buses.
