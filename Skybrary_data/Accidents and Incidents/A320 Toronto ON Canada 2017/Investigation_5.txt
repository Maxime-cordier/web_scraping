of drift was not initially noticed.. The severity of the drift was not recognized until the aircraft was less than 10 feet above ground level and rapidly approaching the runway edge, leaving limited time to correct the aircraft’s trajectory before the aircraft contacted the surface.. Once the flight crew recognised that the aircraft would exit the paved runway surface, the pilot flying continued the landing roll as opposed to executing a go-around following contact with unknown terrain and objects.. The formally stated Findings as to Risk were as follows: There is an increased risk that visual cues may be reduced while flying in precipitation if fitted rain repellent systems are not used.. If the distance between runway edge lights is greater than 50m and runways are not equipped with centreline lighting, there is a risk that visual cues will be insufficient for flight crews to detect lateral drift soon enough to prevent an excursion, while operating aircraft at night during periods of reduced visibility.. Safety Action taken by Air Canada as a result of the excursion and made known to the Investigation included: instituting routine inspection of windshield wiper tensions.. adding a “drift training scenario” to pilot full flight simulator training options.. extending testing of the hydrophobic windshield coatings introduced in 1996 on other aircraft types to determine its “viability” has been extended to include the A320.. The Final Report of the Investigation was authorised for release on 28 March 2018 and it was officially released on 25 April 2018. No Safety Recommendations were made.
