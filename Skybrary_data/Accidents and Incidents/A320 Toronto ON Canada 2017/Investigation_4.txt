Standards and the relevant current Recommendation continues to use the same words as the ones removed from the relevant Canadian Regulatory Guidance Manual quoted above. In connection with the usefulness of centreline lighting, the ICAO ‘Aerodrome Design Manual' (Doc 9157 Part 4 – Visual Aids) 4th Edition, 2004, states that “in normal circumstances, a pilot can maintain the track of the aircraft within approximately 1 to 2 metres of the runway centreline with the aid of this lighting cue” and notes that this guidance is more precise than that possible by pilot assessment of the degree of asymmetry between the lighting along each runway edge, adding that the greater distances involved viewing runway edge lighting and the need for the pilot to look immediately ahead of the aircraft during a landing ground roll “also contribute to the requirements for a well-lit runway centreline”.. More generally, it was noted that the TSB had previously investigated a number of lateral runway excursions during landing in which directional control issues developed in reduced visibility conditions such as the ones here with both the lack of centreline lighting on wide runways and Air Canada’s policy to not either have functioning rain repellent systems or apply the alternative windshield hydrophobic coatings. It was noted that two of these earlier investigations, to an Airbus A340-300 at Toronto in 2005 and to an Airbus A330-300 at Montreal in 2014 had been identified as events where the lack of a rain repellent system or the alternative windshield hydrophobic coating was likely to have raised the lateral runway excursion risk. A third of these earlier TSB-investigated events, involving an Airbus A320 of another Canadian operator at Varadero, Cuba in 2005 had identified the same reduced visibility risk but not because a rain repellent system was not installed but because it was and the flight crew were unaware of the fact. A 2015 review by Airbus of ‘Lateral runway excursions upon landing’ was referenced on the wider subject of the circumstances in which pilots destabilise their aircraft late in the approach. This review included the advice that since an aircraft will be stable when flying with the AP engaged, once it has been disconnected, no sidestick inputs should be made until the pilot has had time to assess the aircraft trajectory. The formally stated Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors were as follows: For undetermined reasons, during the transition to flare, while the aircraft was on the runway centreline, the pilot flying made a right roll command input, which resulted in the aircraft entering a shallow right bank and beginning to drift to the right.. The flight crew had limited visual cues available to accurately judge the aircraft's lateral position given the weather conditions, reduced windshield wiper capability and lack of runway centreline lighting.. Once over the runway surface, the flight crew had to judge the aircraft’s lateral position based solely on their assessment of the degree of asymmetry between the runway edge lights. As a result, the onset
