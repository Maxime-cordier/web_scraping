On 25 December 2013, an Airbus A330-300 (G-VNYC) being operated by Virgin Atlantic Airways on a scheduled international passenger flight from Tobago to St . Lucia as VS98 completed a stable approach in night IMC but the crew found that the initial landing roll needed atypical intervention to ensure direction along the runway was maintained and detected both ‘juddering’ and a more significant rate of deceleration than usual. Considerable impact damage to the lower fuselage and below-floor systems was subsequently discovered.
