On 5 January 2014, an Airbus A320 (VT-ESH) being operated by Air India on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Guwahati to Delhi as AI 889 had to discontinue its ILS approach at destination when the RVR dropped below crew minima. A diversion to Jaipur was then made but by the time the night IMC ILS approach there was commenced, visibility was deteriorating rapidly. The approach was continued below DA without visual reference even in the touchdown and landing roll and it subsequently became apparent that the aircraft had landed alongside the runway. After the main landing gear had been damaged and the left wing partly detached due to tree impact, the remainder of the aircraft was steered back onto the runway and stopped and a MAYDAY was declared. Only one of the 179 occupants sustained a minor injury and, with no signs of fire evident, all passengers were subsequently disembarked to buses and taken to the airport terminal. The aircraft could not be moved and so the airport was closed indefinitely pending that action.
