equipment is not calibrated, NOTAM action to that effect must be taken and flight crews informed as to any equipment which should be considered unserviceable.. that the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) must ensure that the accuracy of TAFs is improved to help with the efficient planning of alternates.. that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) / Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) must ensure that instrument RVR capability is available at all airports where Cat I ILS is provided or the airport is available for other operations where this is necessary e.g. take-offs when the visibility is less than 800 metres.. that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) must ensure that at airports where they have not defined LVPs, take-off minima must be not less than 800 metres visibility.. that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) must have a system to ensure that not all flights file the same alternate airport during periods of congestion. Alternates must nevertheless be filed keeping flight crew qualifications and aircraft technical status in mind.. that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) must ensure that, during the winter months (approximately 15 November to 10 February), designated destination alternates have a visibility trend that is not below the lowest available non-precision approach for 1 hour before and after the expected time of arrival at the alternate..
