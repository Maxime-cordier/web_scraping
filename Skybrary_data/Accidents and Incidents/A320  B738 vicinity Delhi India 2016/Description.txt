On 30 January 2016, an Airbus A320 (VT-EDD) being operated by Air India on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Shamshabad to Delhi as AIC543 and a Boeing 787-800 (VT-JBE) being operated by Jet Airways on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Bengaluru to Delhi as JAI833 came into close proximity in day VMC when the A320 passed ahead and below the 737 as both followed the ILS to different runways which had intersecting extended centrelines. ATC instructed the 737 to go around and the A320 crew subsequently initiated a go around themselves. No avoiding action manoeuvre was performed by either aircraft and none of the 276 passengers on board the two aircraft were aware of the encounter. The minimum recorded separation was 1.2nm laterally and 300 feet vertically.
