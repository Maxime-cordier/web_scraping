Neither the controller nor the Air India pilots directly involved logged or otherwise reported the event but when it became known, an Investigation was commenced for the Indian DGCA by a specifically-appointed Committee of Inquiry established in accordance with the Aircraft Accident Investigation of Accidents and Incidents Rules 2012 and supported by the Aircraft Accidents Investigation Bureau. Recorded ATC communications with both aircraft and recorded ATC radar data were the main source of factual information about the event. It was noted that the A320 flight crew consisted of a 55 year-old Captain who had a total of 18,904 hours flying experience which included 15,029 hours on type. The 41 year-old First Officer, who had been PF for the flight, had 8,714 hours total flying experience which included 4,005 hours on type. It was established that on the day of the investigated event, Delhi was using its three runways in an easterly direction with departures only from 09, arrivals only on 10 and mixed mode operations in 11. The extended centreline of runway 09 crosses that of runway 10 at a distance of 1.08 nm from the 09 threshold and crosses that of runway 11 at a distance of 7.6 nm from the 09 threshold. Arriving traffic is transferred from the Area Control frequency to Approach Control, then to Approach Arrival and finally to the appropriate TWR frequency - South for landings on runway 11 and Middle for landings on runway 10. The A320 crew were advised whilst still on the Area Control frequency that they would be landing on runway 11 and cleared for an RNAV STAR. The aircraft reported established on the runway 11 LLZ when it had actually just established on the runway 09 LLZ about 23 nm from touchdown. It then continued on this incorrect LLZ whilst continuing to confirm it was on the runway11 LLZ to both Approach Control and Approach Arrival before being transferred to the TWR South frequency with 8nm to run and by now slightly south of the runway 11 LLZ and about to cross it. Meanwhile, the 737, just behind the A320 in the landing sequence, confirmed (correctly) that it was established on the runway 10 ILS LLZ to Approach Arrival with 14 nm to run and was then transferred to the TWR Middle frequency with 9nm to run about half a minute after the A320 had been transferred to TWR South. Whilst these transfers were taking place, a Current Conflict Warning (CCW) was active in Approach Arrival indicating a loss of the prescribed standard separation between the A320 and the 737 as the tracks of both aircraft slowly converged towards the intersection of the 09 extended and 10 extended centrelines. Realising that the A320 was tracking into conflict with the 737 he had on the 10 LLZ, the TWR Middle Controller tried to transfer it back to Approach Arrival but it was immediately transferred back. The A320 continued towards runway 09 without receiving a landing clearance and passed 1.2 nm in
