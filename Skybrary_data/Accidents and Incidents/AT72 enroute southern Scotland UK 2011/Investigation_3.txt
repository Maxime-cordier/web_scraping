that ATR amends all relevant Aircraft Maintenance Manual tasks to include a warning to highlight that the cams on the rear rudder quadrant shaft can be installed incorrectly. [2011-11]. It is recommended that ATR amends the Aircraft Maintenance Manual task ‘Operational Test of the Rudder Travel Limitation Unit’ to state that: (1) the test should be carried out for a minimum of 30 seconds and (2) should an asymmetric restriction of the rudder pedals be detected or if the FLT CTL light illuminates, further inspection of the TLU system should be conducted. [2011-12]. It is recommended that the European Aviation Safety Agency require ATR to modify the cams on the rudder Travel Limitation Unit on all applicable aircraft, to reduce the risk of incorrect assembly. [2012-002]. It is recommended that ATR amend the ATR 72 QRH section 2.22 A to state that the green LO SPD light should illuminate after 30 seconds, when the rudder Travel Limitation Unit switch is manually selected to the LO SPD position. [2012-003] It was noted that in response to the initial three recommendations, ATR had issued an AOM on 19 April 2011 advising operators of the incident and emphasising the importance of independent inspections after any maintenance is performed on a flight control system. ATR also updated the ATR72 AMM task ‘Removal and Installation of TLU Mechanism Assy’ to include a requirement to record the position of the right hand cam before removal and amended ATR 72 AMM task ‘Operational Test of the Rudder Travel Limiter Unit’ to reflect the intent of Safety Recommendation 2011-12. A number of Safety Actions taken by the maintenance organisation involved, including the replacement of the JAR 145 Accountable Manager in post at the time of the event were also noted. The Final Report of the Investigation AAIB Bulletin: 7/2012 EW/C2011/03/04 was issued on 12 July 2012.
