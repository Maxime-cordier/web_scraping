On 5 April 2019, a Boeing 737-500 (LY-KLJ) being operated by Klasjet on an international passenger charter flight from Madrid to Kaunas, Lithuania as KLJ125 had made a daylight takeoff from Madrid when, having entered IMC, it requested an immediate return, declaring an emergency for reasons which crew lack of language competence prevented being communicated. ATC observed the aircraftâ€™s extremely erratic flightpath on radar and twice attempted to vector it onto a stable ILS approach but both were discontinued and it was then successfully diverted by ATC to a nearby military airbase.
