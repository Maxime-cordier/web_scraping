On 27 February 2012, the crew of an Airbus A330-200 (F-GZCG) being operated by Air France on a scheduled passenger flight from Antananarivo, Madagascar to Paris CDG in dark night conditions entered Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and encountered unanticipated severe turbulence. They briefly lost control of their aircraft as it rapidly climbed 2000 feet at a high rate before full recovery was achieved as the worst of the turbulence passed. One member of the cabin crew and one passenger sustained minor injuries during the excursion. The aircraft was undamaged.
