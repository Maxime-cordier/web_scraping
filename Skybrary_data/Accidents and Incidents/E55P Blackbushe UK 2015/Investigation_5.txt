an earth bank and cars in a car park beyond it, causing the wing to separate and a fire to start. Although the aircraft occupants survived these impacts, they died from the effects of fire. Towards the end of the flight, a number of factors came together to create a very high workload situation for the pilot, to the extent that his mental capacity could have become saturated. His ability to take on new and critical information, and adapt his situational awareness, would have been impeded. In conjunction with audio overload and the mental stressors this can invoke, this may have lead him to become fixated on continuing the approach towards a short runway." Safety Action taken by the Aircraft Operator consequent upon the accident and noted by the Investigation included the following: the Phenom 300 is now operated with two pilots, although a risk analysis process may be developed which can assess the risk of each flight in order to determine if a single-pilot operation can be justified for the purposes of operational flexibility such as on short flights in relatively low-workload environments.. The Stabilised Approach 'gate' for VMC approaches has been raised from 200 feet agl to 500 feet agl.. Pilot recurrent training requirements have been enhanced to better address both short runway operations and time-critical decision making.. Plans have been made to implement OFDM.. A Special Bulletin was published on 6 August 2015 to report the initial factual findings of the Investigation and the Final Report of the Investigation was published on 8 December 2016. No Safety Recommendations were made.
