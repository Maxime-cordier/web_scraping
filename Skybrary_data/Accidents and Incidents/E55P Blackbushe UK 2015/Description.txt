On 31 July 2015, an Embraer EMB-505 Phenom 300 (HZ-IBN) being operated by a single pilot and on a private flight from Milan Malpensa to Blackbushe overran the landing runway at destination after a long and fast touchdown following a day VMC visual approach. After hitting a small embankment just beyond the end of the runway, it collided with unoccupied parked cars and was destroyed by a combination of impact damages and an intense fire in which the pilot and three passengers were killed.
