On 26 July 2017 a Hawker Beechcraft 850 (TC-MAN) being operated by Genel Havacilik on a non-scheduled international passenger flight from Istanbul Ataturk to Mykonos carried out an unstabilised approach at destination in day VMC and continued this to a landing during which lateral control was briefly lost and the left wing contacted the runway resulting in it sustaining extensive damage. The taxi in was completed and the solitary uninjured passenger was disembarked.
