Once notified of the Accident several days after it had occurred, an Investigation by the Spanish Commission for the Investigation of Accidents and Incidents (CIAIAC) was commenced. This notification delay meant that relevant data from both the CVR and FDR had been overwritten, however the operator was requested to provide a copy of the QAR data used for OFDM purposes and did so. All relevant ATC recorded data were also available. It was noted that the aircraft crew had consisted of a 38 year-old Captain of Italian nationality and a 29 year-old First Officer of British nationality and that the ATS sector involved had been the ‘RNE’ sector of the Canaries’ TMA. It was established that the 737 crew had requested descent clearance when between waypoints ‘TERTO’ and ‘POKAB’ and level at FL370 (see the illustration below) and had received clearance to descend to FL130. Their subsequent statement noted that they “had already passed their calculated top of descent point” and had commenced descent by selecting 'SPD' mode which had resulted in the aircraft beginning “a steep descent" recollected as made at a rate of at least 2000 fpm. However, some 36 seconds after the controller had issued the descent clearance with the aircraft having only reached FL 368, the controller, having now noticed that there was no horizontal separation between the descending 737 and an AIRBUS A-320 at FL350, instructed the 737 to stop at FL 360, advising that this was because of a “potential traffic conflict” later advised as an Airbus A320 at FL350 and on a similar track less than 4 nm behind the 737. The Captain’s initial response to this unexpected change was to select ALT HOLD mode in place of ‘SPD’ mode before almost immediately disconnecting the AP at FL364 with the rate of descent recorded as 3,600 fpm. Manual inputs to the control panel followed with an initial control column input resulting in a change in the pitch attitude from -2° to zero in one second which generated a peak vertical acceleration of 1.409g and instantly reduced the rate of descent from 3,600 fpm to 2340 fpm. Then, over the next six seconds, pitch attitude was returned to -2.1° which restored the rate of descent to 3660 fpm as the aircraft reached FL360. The AP and ‘ALT HOLD’ mode were then re-engaged, resulting in an increase in the pitch attitude from -2.3° to +1.6° over just one second which caused another spike in vertical acceleration to 1.69 g. One second later, the AP was again disengaged and recorded vertical acceleration reduced to 0.93 g. Five seconds later, a further manual pitch up input produced another spike in vertical acceleration of 1.41 g before a reduction, then sudden increase in pitch attitude led to yet another spike in vertical acceleration, this time to 1.43 g. This last input finally resulted in the reversal of the descent into a climb at FL357 after which FL 360 was regained. It was noted that throughout the episode, the
