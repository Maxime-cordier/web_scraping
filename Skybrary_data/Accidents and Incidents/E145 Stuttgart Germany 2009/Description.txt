On 5 January 2009, an Embraer 145 being operated by Flybe on a scheduled passenger flight from Birmingham to Stuttgart overran runway 07 at destination after a touchdown in normal day visibility and had only come to a stop in the subsequent Runway End Safety Area. None of the occupants were injured and all subsequently left the aircraft by use of the passenger stairs. Minor damage was caused to both the aircraft and to airfield lighting.
