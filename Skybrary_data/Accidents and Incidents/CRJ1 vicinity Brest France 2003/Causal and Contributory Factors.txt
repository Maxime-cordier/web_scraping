The outcome of the approach was attributed to inappropriate airraft management. According to the Report the causes of the accident were as follows: "neglecting to select the APPR mode at the start of the approach, which led to non-capture of the localizer then of the glide slope;. partial detection of flight path deviations, due to the crewâ€™s focusing on vertical navigation then on horizontal navigation;. continuing a non-stabilised approach down to the decision altitude.". "Lack of communication and co-ordination in the cockpit, and a change of strategy on the part of the Controller in managing the flight were contributing factors.".
