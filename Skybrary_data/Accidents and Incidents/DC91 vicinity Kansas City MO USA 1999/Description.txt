On March 4, 1999, a DC9-10 operated by USA Jet Airlines, at night and on final approach to land at Kansas City International Airport encountered a flock of large birds. Following the bird strike, several birds were ingested into both engines which resulted in a partial thrust loss on one engine and near total thrust loss on the other. The crew managed to regain sufficient thrust to continue the approach and land without further incident.
