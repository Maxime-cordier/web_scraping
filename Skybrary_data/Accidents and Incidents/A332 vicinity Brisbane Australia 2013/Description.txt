On 21 November 2013, the crew of an Airbus A330-200 (A6-EYJ) being operated by Etihad on a scheduled passenger flight from Brisbane to Singapore successfully rejected a daylight take off in normal ground visibility due to an airspeed indication failure. The aircraft returned to the gate. After maintenance intervention and release to service, the flight departed again almost 2 hours later. This time an airspeed discrepancy again occurred but was reported not to have been detected in time to reject the take off. Further system problems followed and a MAYDAY was declared and an uneventful air turnback was completed.
