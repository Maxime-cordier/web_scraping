On 21 February 2001, a level bust 10 nm north of Oslo Airport in day VMC by a climbing PIA AIRBUS A-310 operating a scheduled passenger flight from Oslo to Copenhagen led to loss of separation with an SAS BOEING 737-600 inbound to Oslo from Alesund in which response to a co-ordinated TCAS RA by the A310 was not in accordance with its likely activation (descend). The B736 received and correctly actioned a Climb RA.
