The report gives the cause of the accident as: "The power levers were moved by a pilot from the flight idle position into the ground control range, which led to an irreversible loss of flight control." and gives the following Contributory Causes: "By suddenly insisting the First Officer fly the final approach, the pilot in command created an environment, which led to a breakdown of crew resource management processes, the non observance of the operatorâ€™s standard operating procedures and a resultant excessive high approach speed.. An attempt to rectify this excessive high approach speed most likely resulted in the non compliance with the Standard Operating Procedures and the movement of the power levers below flight idle.".
