which aided aquaplaning.. The Investigation noted that three Safety Recommendations had been made as a result of the Operator’s own internal Accident Investigation: A review of the way in which pilots on the EMB-145 might be reacquainted with the importance of using the correct landing technique on wet runways should be made.. A review of guidance provided to flight crew for circumstances where braking effectiveness during landing is not sufficient should be undertaken.. A review should be made of the circumstances under which aquaplaning can occur on wet runways so as to better inform the management of this risk.. The BFU decided that “based on the described actions (of the Operator) the BFU will abstain from Safety Recommendations.” The Final Report of the Investigation was published in January 2007 and may be seen in full at SKYbrary bookshelf: BFU - Investigation Report EX006-0/05
