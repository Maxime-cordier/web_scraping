for three months prior to the crash was that the private physicians and psychiatrists he had consulted had, despite likely awareness of his occupation, considered that medical confidentiality should not be breached in the wider public interest. This position was found to be underpinned by the requirement under German data protection regulations that meant that only a determination of "imminent danger" to the patient or others constituted an acceptable reason for a physician diagnosing an illness not compatible with pilot duties or with flight safety to be divulged without patient consent. No such determination was made by any of the private physicians who saw the First Officer. It was noted that with effect from 8 April 2013, the EU “Aircrew Regulation” had come into force in Germany and that a standardisation inspection carried out at the LBA by EASA in July 2014 "had concluded that the LBA lacked powers to fulfil its responsibilities in the medical domain and that no process for internal audits or safety risk management was in place" and noted the existence of "possible conflicts between German data protection laws and the application of the Aircrew Regulation Part-MED" which require that the State Safety Regulator must have effective oversight of AMEs including those working at Company AeMCs. It was noted that EASA had advised the BEA in February 2016 that some related findings from this Inspection were still open. The Investigation also noted that in the presence of a locked flight deck door, the mitigation of the risk of 'pilot incapacitation' was effectively valid only in the case of physical illness if the procedures advocated in ICAO Doc 8984 the "Manual of Civil Aviation Medicine" were applied. It was also noted that "specialists in aerospace medicine and psychiatrists......generally agree that serious mental illnesses involving sudden psychosis are relatively rare and their onset is impossible to predict" and that "for recurrent mental disorders that come in cycles, crises can leave no traces" so that when medical assessments take place in "the calm period of a cycle", any disorders can go undetected. In any case, "detection tools and methods can remain ineffective in cases where the patient is intentionally hiding any history of mental disorder and/or is faking being in good health". The Investigation noted a small number of previous accidents and incidents in which the mental health of one of the pilots had been or may have been a precipitating factor including in particular a 2012 incident involving a JetBlue A320 on a domestic flight in the USA and the fatal accident to a Mozambique Airlines E190 when in Namibian airspace on an international flight the following year. However, no corresponding actions taken as a result were identified. Safety Action The Investigation noted action taken by a number of bodies to review the risks posed by pilots experiencing mental health problems whilst the BEA Investigation was in progress as follows: The EASA, in response to a request from the European Commission, set up a Task Force which made
