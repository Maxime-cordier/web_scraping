[FRAN 2012 040]. that EASA define recurrent training programme requirements to make sure, through practical exercises, that the theoretical knowledge, particularly on flight mechanics, is well understood. [FRAN 2012 041]. that EASA review the requirements for initial, recurrent and type rating training for pilots in order to develop and maintain a capacity to manage crew resources when faced with the surprise generated by unexpected situations. [FRAN 2012 042]. that EASA ensure that operators reinforce CRM training to enable acquisition and maintenance of adequate behavioural automatic responses in unexpected and unusual situations with a highly charged emotional factor. [FRAN.2012.043]. that EASA define criteria for selection and recurrent training among instructors that would allow a high and standardized level of instruction to be reached. [FRAN.2012.044]. that EASA modify the basis of the regulations in order to ensure better fidelity for simulators in reproducing realistic scenarios of abnormal situations. [FRAN.2012.045]. that EASA ensure the introduction into the training scenarios of the effects of surprise in order to train pilots to face these phenomena and to work in situations with a highly charged emotional factor. [FRAN.2012.046]. that EASA require a review of the re-display and reconnection logic of the flight directors after their disappearance, in particular to review the conditions in which an action by the crew would be necessary to re-engage them. [FRAN.2012.047]. that EASA require a review of the functional or display logic of the flight director so that it disappears or presents appropriate orders when the stall warning is triggered. [FRAN.2012.048]. that EASA study the relevance of having a dedicated warning provided to the crew when specific monitoring is triggered, in order to facilitate comprehension of the situation. [FRAN.2012.049]. that EASA determine the conditions in which, on approach to stall, the presence of a dedicated visual indications, combined with an aural warning should be made mandatory. [FRAN.2012.050]. that EASA require a review of the conditions for the functioning of the stall warning in flight when speed measurements are very low. [FRAN.2012.051]. that EASA improve the feedback process by making mandatory the operational and human factors analysis of in-service events in order to improve procedures and the content of training programmes. [FRAN.2012.052]. that the DGAC take steps aimed at improving the relevance and the quality of incident reports written by flight crews and their distribution, in particular to manufacturers. [FRAN.2012.053]. that the DGAC review the organisation of its oversight so as to improve its cohesion and effectiveness. [FRAN.2012.054]. that the DGAC ensure the adequacy of the conditions of recruitment and training so that all of its inspectors have the skills required to exercise their functions. [FRAN.2012.055]. that ICAO amend Annex 12 on search and rescue operations so as to encourage Contracting States to equip their search aircraft with buoys to measure drift and to drop them, when these units are involved in the search for persons lost at sea. [FRAN 2012 056]. Safety Action by Air France following the accident included the following: the completion of the already-started but non-mandatory A330 fleet
