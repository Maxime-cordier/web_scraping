On 29 February 2004, a B732 being operated by Ryanair and taxiing in after landing across an intermediate point on runway 06L did not notice a MyTravel Airways AIRBUS A-321 accelerating along the same runway on its take off roll in normal day visibility. However, the A321 saw the potential conflict and made a high speed rejected take off as the 737 continued across the runway ahead, thereby eliminating any risk of collision.
