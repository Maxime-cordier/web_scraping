On 1 December 2021, a lightly loaded Boeing 737-800 (G-JZHL) being operated by Jet2.com on an international non-revenue positioning flight from Kuusamo to London Stansted only became airborne in night VMC shortly before the end of the 2,500 metre-long runway and failed to climb normally until the correct thrust setting was applied. Thereafter, the flight was completed without further event.
