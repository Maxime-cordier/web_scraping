The world's first four engined turboprop airliner flew as the Vickers Viscount 630 variant and was subsequently introduced into service in the 1950s as the Viscount 700 series and later followed by the larger Viscount 800 series. The 800 series remained in widespread use as a short haul passenger aircraft carrying up to 80 people until around 1990. Now only a few remain airworthy and are in use as freighters, mainly in Africa. The engines were Rolls Royce Dart turboprops. Airframe designer and manufacturer Vickers became part of British Aerospace (BAe) which itself later became part of BAE Systems, which no longer manufactures civil aircraft. Note: The ICAO Designator VISC has been removed from ICAO Doc 8643 as aircraft of this type no longer exist in airworthy condition. Wing span (metric): 28.56 m. Length (metric): 26.11 m.
