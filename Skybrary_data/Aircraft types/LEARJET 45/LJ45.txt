The Learjet 45 is a mid-sized business jet aircraft introduced in January 1998. The cockpit is equipped with a four-screen Electronic Flight Instrument System avionics system. The aircraft is powered by two Honeywell TFE731-20 engines, a version developed specifically for this airframe. An internal APU provides ground power. The Learjet 45XR is an upgraded version introduced in June, 2004, offering higher takeoff weights, faster cruise speeds and faster time-to-climb rates as compared to the LJ45. The increases are due to the upgrading of the engines to the TFE731-20BR configuration. The LJ45 is a member of the Bombardier Learjet Family. Wing span (metric): 14.58 m. Length (metric): 17.68 m.
