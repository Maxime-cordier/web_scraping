The Learjet 40 is derived from the Learjet 45, but with a shorter fuselage (60 cm), and is powered by two Honeywell TFE731-20AR engines. The Learjet 40XR is an upgraded version introduced in October, 2004, offering higher takeoff weights, faster cruise speeds and faster time-to-climb rates as compared to the LJ40. The increases are due to the upgrading of the engines to the TFE731-20BR configuration. The LJ40 is a member of the Bombardier Learjet Family. Wing span (metric): 14.56 m. Length (metric): 16.93 m.
