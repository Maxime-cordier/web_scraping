The 200 series proved so popular that Beechcraft began work on a successor, with the Beechcraft designation Model 300 and marketed as the Super King Air 300. The B200's airframe was cleaned up and even more powerful engines (PT6A-60A, rated at 1050 shp) installed in redesigned cowlings (known as pitot cowlings due to the reshaped engine air intakes). Two versions, the standard Model 300 with increased MTOW of 6,300 kg and the Model 300LW with MTOW limited to 5,700 kg. Wing span (metric): 16.61 m. Length (metric): 13.34 m. Height (metric): 4.57 m. Powerplant: 2 x PT6A-60A, 1050 shp each.. Engine Model(s): Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6. 2 x PT6A-60A, 1050 shp each.
