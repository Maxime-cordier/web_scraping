The Ka-52 (NATO reporting name: Hokum B) is a modification of the basic Ka-50 design. It features a two-seat side-by-side cockpit, and is designed to detect targets and redistribute them among supporting Ka-50s. In comparison to the original Ka-50, it has a somewhat softer nose profile due to the wider cockpit, reduced cockpit armor, and large nose-mounted radome. Equipment includes radar with two antennasâ€”mast-mounted for aerial targets and nose-mounted for ground targets, and Samshite day-and-night TV/thermal sighting system in two spherical turrets (one over the cockpit and second under the nose). Wing span (metric): 14.50 m. Length (metric): 13.50 m. Height (metric): 5.40 m. Powerplant: 2 x Klimov TV3-117VK turboshafts, 1,660 kW (2,226 shp) each. 2 x Klimov TV3-117VK turboshafts, 1,660 kW (2,226 shp) each
