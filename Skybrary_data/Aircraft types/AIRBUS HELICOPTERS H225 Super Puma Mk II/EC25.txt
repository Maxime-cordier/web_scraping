The The Airbus Helicopters H225 Super Puma Mk II+ is a long-range passenger transport helicopter developed as the next generation in the civilian Super Puma family. It is a twin-engined aircraft and can carry up to 24 passengers along with 2 crew and a cabin attendant, dependent on customer configuration. The helicopter is marketed for offshore support and VIP passenger transport duties, as well as public service missions. The H225 (and EC-225) is based on the Eurocopter AS332L2 Super Puma, improving upon the design with a five-blade main rotor incorporating a new airfoil shape to reduce vibration levels. The helicopter is powered by two Turbomeca Makila 2A1 turboshaft engines mounted over the cabin, which feature a dual-channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system and anti-icing system to enable it to operate in very cold climates. Other improvements include a reinforced main rotor gearbox and a full glass cockpit with Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays. Wing span (metric): 16.20 m. Length (metric): 19.50 m.
