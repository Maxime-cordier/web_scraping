cannot be determined;. Not Applicable if the barrier is not relevant to the occurrence.. The weights of all barriers scored as stopped, remaining known and remaining assumed are summed. The result (a number between 0 and 18) is converted into a barrier score between 0 and 9 (9 meaning a score of 17-18, 8 - a score of 15-16, etc.). The safety risk score is a two-digit value where the first digit is the severity score (A to X) and the second one is the barrier score (0 to 9). This code is then put into the ERCS matrix which is a table with barrier score on one axis and severity score on the other. The cells of the table are coloured to facilitate the determination of the urgency of the recommended action to be taken about the occurrence: RED colour means high risk (i.e. high number of fatalities combined with few barriers). YELLOW colour means elevated risk. GREEN colour means low risk (i.e. either a lot of applicable barriers or few possible fatalities). Note however, that such occurrences may lead to increased risk scores when combined with other events.. Furthermore, each ERCS score is assigned a corresponding numerical value of risk magnitude to facilitate the aggregation and numerical analysis of multiple occurrences. These range between 0,000001 for an E9 occurrence (a risk of injury mitigated by a lot of barriers) and 1000000 for X0 (a catastrophic event with no barriers). The full spectrum is specified in the Annex to the Regulation.
