Small UAS (sUAS) — The FAA defines this as an unmanned aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) on takeoff, including everything that is onboard or attached to the aircraft.. Means of compliance — A person designing or producing a Standard Remote ID drone or broadcast module for operation in U.S. airspace must show that they have met the requirements of the sUAS Remote Identification Rule by describing the methods by which the person complies with the performance-based requirements for remote identification.. Declaration of compliance — This is a record submitted to the FAA by the producer of a Standard Remote ID Drone or Remote ID Broadcast Module to attest that all production requirements of the FAA’s final rule have been met.. Standard remote identification — The FAA defines this as “the ability of a drone in flight to provide identification and location information that can be received by other parties.” A Standard Remote ID Drone is one that is produced with built-in remote ID broadcast capability in accordance with the FAA Remote ID Rule’s requirements.. Remote identification broadcast module — This means a device that broadcasts identification and location information about the drone and its take-off location in accordance with the FAA Remote ID Rule’s requirements. (The broadcast module can be added to a drone to retrofit it with remote ID capability.). Operational waiver/waiver — This is an official document issued by the FAA that approves certain operations of aircraft outside the limitations of a regulation (e.g., deviation via an operational waiver requests to fly specific drone operations not allowed in Part 107). Essentially, certificated remote pilots will be authorised to deviate if the FAA determines that they can still fly safely using alternative methods..
