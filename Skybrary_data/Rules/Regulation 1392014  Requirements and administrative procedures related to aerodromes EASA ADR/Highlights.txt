Important novelties mandated by regulation (EU) No 139/2014, in comparison with national requirements for aerodromes, include the need for a declaration to be made by apron management service providers and the need to improve control on airside driving. EASA ADR is not only applicable to aerodrome operators but also to apron management service providers. Unlike aerodrome operators the latter do not undergo a certification process but are rather required to submit a declaration to the competent authority regarding their compliance with all applicable requirements of the Basic Regulation and its implementing rules. Upon receiving a declaration from a provider of apron management services intending to provide such services at an aerodrome, the Competent Authority is required to verify that the declaration contains all the information required by Part ADR.OR and to acknowledge receipt of the declaration to the organisation submitting it. Apron management service providers are required to maintain compliance with the applicable requirements and with the information given in the declaration as well as to notify the Competent Authority of any changes to their declarations or the means of compliance they use through submission of an amended declaration. Apron management service providers are required to provide their services in accordance with the aerodrome manual and comply with all relevant provisions contained therein. Under EASA ADR aerodrome operators are required to establish and implement procedures for the training, assessment and authorisation of all drivers operating on the movement area.
