Important changes mandated by Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, in comparison with EU-OPS and JAR OPS-3, are safety management and fatigue risk management. ORO.GEN.200 (Management system), on top of requiring a function to monitor compliance of the operator with the relevant requirements (the old quality system of EU-OPS and JAR OPS-3), requires the practice of safety management – in accordance with ICAO Annex 19 and Doc 9859 - in the identification of aviation safety hazards entailed by the activities of the operator, their evaluation and the management of associated risks, including taking actions to mitigate the risk and verify their effectiveness. This requirement is applicable to specialised and non-specialised commercial operators and non-commercial operators of complex aircraft. ORO.FTL.120 (FRM) requires commercial operators of aeroplanes to establish, implement and maintain FRM as an integral part of their management system. FRM requirements include the establishment of a hazard identification and risk assessment process that allows managing the operational risk(s) of the operator arising from crew member fatigue on a continuous basis. Requirements further include a risk mitigation process that provides for remedial actions to be implemented promptly, which are necessary to effectively mitigate the operator’s risk(s) arising from crew member fatigue and for continuous monitoring and regular assessment of the mitigation of fatigue risks achieved by such actions. FRM requirements also mandate FRM safety assurance and promotion processes. Air taxi, emergency medical service and single pilot CAT operations by aeroplanes are not required to comply with FRM requirements.
