Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 of 5 October 2012 and its subsequent amendments lay down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to air operations pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council ("Basic Regulation"). This Regulation is officially referred to as IR-OPS (Implementing Rules â€“ Operations), but it is also known as EASA OPS or EASA AIR OPS. It replaces EU-OPS (Regulation (EC) 859/2008) with regard to commercial operations of aeroplanes (A) and JAR-OPS 3 with regard to commercial operations of helicopters (H) as well as old national requirements on commercial operations of sailplanes (S) and balloons (B) and existing national requirements on non-commercial operations of complex and other-than-complex aircraft (including S and B) and specialised air operations (most notably aerial work). The Regulation establishes also detailed rules for ramp inspections of aircraft of operators under the safety oversight of another State when landed at aerodromes located in the territory subject to the provisions of the Treaty.
