Being confident that safety regulatory requirements are adequate will depend on the extent to which achieved civil air display safety standards are understood. As with all other areas of aviation, this will depend on a combination of effective direct oversight and the recording and analysis of all operational safety-related occurrences. Over -dependence on the independent investigation of fatal accidents alone is likely to mean that opportunities to address risk management deficiencies which could have prevented such accidents have been missed. The UK AAIB Investigation into the multi-fatality UK air display accident in 2015 mentioned earlier has identified considerable evidence of failure to report display safety occurrences appropriately or at all, including pre 2015 occurrences featuring both the crash pilot and the (annual) air display at which the crash occurred. The importance of occurrence reporting in the explicit case of air display flying warrants a strong emphasis given that the extent of the community with real insight into risk, especially in the case of display aerobatic flight, is extremely limited. This importance is further heightened by the high proportion of 'human factor' causation found in air display crashes coupled with the absence of crash-proof data recorders in the majority of the aircraft which take part in such displays. However, there is also evidence that Safety Recommendations issued as the result of independent investigations of air show crashes have not always been accepted and, rather more worryingly, have been notified by the recipient as accepted and then the necessary action has not followed.
