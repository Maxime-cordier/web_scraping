Following a series of mid-air encounters in which safety margins have been lost, including accidents in Yaizu (Japan) in 2001 and in Überlingen (Germany) in 2002, it was considered necessary to upgrade the current airborne collision avoidance system software. Dedicated studies concluded that with the current airborne collision avoidance system software there is a probability of a mid-air collision risk of 2,7 × 10 –8 per flight hour. Therefore the current ACAS II version 7.0 is considered to be of an unacceptable safety risk. The new software version of the airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS II) to avoid mid-air collision shall be implemented at all aircraft flying in the airspace covered by Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. To ensure the highest possible safety standards, aircraft which do not fall within the scope of the mandatory carriage requirement, but were equipped with ACAS II prior to entry into force of this Regulation, should install ACAS II containing the latest version of collision avoidance software. In order to ensure that the safety benefits associated with the new software version are achieved, all aircraft need to be equipped as soon as practically possible. However, it is necessary to provide a realistic time for the aeronautical industry to adapt to this new Regulation taking into account the availability of new equipment.
