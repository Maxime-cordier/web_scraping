It has generally been accepted that the potential risk of uncontrolled passenger PED use affecting the normal function of aircraft systems has been highest in more modern aircraft where the rise of automation has been facilitated by a rapid increase in the scale and complexity of electrical rather than mechanical system control. A supplementary investigation into the possibility that PED interference had affected aircraft systems prior to the loss of an aircraft in 1988 concluded, in 2013, that it had been unlikely in the case of the 'legacy' aircraft type involved - see the Editor's Note which follows below. The risk that there might be such system effects has been more recently addressed by the Aircraft Type Certification process for new aircraft, which now requires evidence that aircraft systems can tolerate the level of electromagnetic radiation which routine use of a particular aircraft type might generate. Guidance such as the AMC issued by the FAA as AC 20-164 exists. Editor's Note ^ On 16 December 2013, the Norwegian AIB (SHT) published a report of a supplementary investigation into a CFIT accident to a Wideroe DE HAVILLAND CANADA DHC-7 aircraft which occurred on a non precision approach to Brønnøysund Norway in IMC during a domestic flight in 1988 in which the aircraft was destroyed and all occupants killed. This report was made available in English translation on 24 January 2014. The purpose of the supplementary investigation reported, which was prompted by queries raised during 2013, was to investigate the chances that mobile phone use had affected aircraft systems in any way that might have contributed to the premature descent which had occurred. It was concluded that the presence and possible use of the mobile phones known to have been on board the aircraft had not led to interference from these devices which would have been capable of influencing the course of events..
