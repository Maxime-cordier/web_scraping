Damage to composite structures may not be visible following an impact collision. All impacts must be reported immediately. A suitably qualified and licensed engineer needs to inspect the impact area and formally record the inspection and findings in the Aircraft Technical Log. Failure to detect or report potential damage to an aircraft may result in an aircraft getting airborne in an unairworthy condition.
