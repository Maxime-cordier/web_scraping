In accordance with Regulation EC 2042/2003 Annex I, Part M.A.301, the continuing airworthiness of an aircraft shall be ensured by accomplishing any applicable ADs. Consequently, no person may operate an aircraft to which an AD applies, except in accordance with the requirements of that AD unless otherwise specified by the EASA [EC 2042/2003 Annex I, Part M.A.303] or agreed with the Authority of the State of Registry [EU 2018/1139, Article 71 exemption]. ADs applicable to an EASA-approved type certificate are those ADs which have been issued or adopted by EASA. The dissemination of airworthiness directives to aircraft owners is a responsibility of the State of Registry and does not belong to the Agency. EASA publishes a complete list of ADs that have been issued by EASA or have received an EASA approval number since 28 September 2003. The EASA publication also contains all Proposed Airworthiness Directives (PAD) and allows for user comments for consultation purposes. After 15th of September 2008, new Safety Information Bulletins, Foreign State of Design Safety Publications and Foreign State of Design ADs are published.
