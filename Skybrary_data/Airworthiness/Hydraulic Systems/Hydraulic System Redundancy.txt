Hydraulic system redundancy is achieved by two primary means - multiple systems and multiple pressure sources within the same system. Multiple Pressure Sources. Hydraulic systems often have more than one pump available to pressurise the system. It is quite common for a system to have one or more engine driven pumps plus one or more electric pumps. In some cases, a manual pump is also incorporated. Some systems only use the electric or manual pumps while on the ground when the engines are not operating. Others use the electric pump(s) to provide an additional pressure source during high demand situations such as gear retraction or as the primary pressure source in the event of the loss of the engine driven pump(s). When an electric pump is used as the primary pressure source, a second electric pump or a Ram Air Turbine might be incorporated into the system as a backup source of hydraulic pressure. Provision of multiple pressure sources helps to ensure that the entire hydraulic system is not lost in the event of a single component failure.. Multiple Hydraulic Systems. In many aircraft, flight control surfaces are hydraulically actuated. In these cases, multiple actuators on each surface, powered from multiple hydraulic systems, are essential to ensure that the failure a hydraulic system will not result in loss of control. In modern commercial aircraft, it is common to power the flight control surfaces from three independant hydraulic systems. The control surface architecture allows for failure of two of those systems without compromising control..
