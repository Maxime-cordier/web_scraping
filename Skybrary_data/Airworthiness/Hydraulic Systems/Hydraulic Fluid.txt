Fluid is the medium via which a hydraulic system transmits its energy and, theoretically, practically any fluid could be utilized. However, given the operating pressure (3000 to 5000 psi) that most aircraft hydraulic systems generate in combination with the environmental conditions and strict safety criteria under which the system must operate, the hydraulic fluid that is used should have the following properties: High Flash Point. In the event of a hydraulic leak, fluid ignition should not occur at the normal operating temperatures of the surrounding components. Special hydraulic fluids with fire resistant properties have been developed for aviation use. These fluids are phosphate esters and, unlike mineral oil based hydraulic fluids, they are very difficult to ignite at room temperature. However, if the fluid is heated to temperatures in excess of 180 degrees C, it will sustain combustion. The auto-ignition temperature of most aviation hydraulic fluids is in the range of 475 degrees C.. Adequate Viscosity. Aircraft hydraulic systems must work efficiently over a broad temperature spectrum. The fluid used must flow easily at very low temperatures but must also maintain adequate viscosity at high temperatures. The ideal hydraulic fluid will have a very low freezing point and a very high boiling point.. Lubricant Properties. The hydraulic fluid acts as a lubricant for the pumps, actuators and motors within the system. The fluid should have anti-corrosion properties and be thermally stable.. Thermal Capacity/Conductivity. Hydraulic fluid acts as a system coolant. The fluid must be able to readily absorb and release heat..
