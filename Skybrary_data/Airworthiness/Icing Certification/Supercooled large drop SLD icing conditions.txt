The long established Appendix C conditions were supplemented at CS25 Amendment 16 in 2015 by Appendix O for SLD icing conditions. The corresponding changes have been introduced also by the FAA in Appendix O to 14 CFR Part-25. Appendix O consists of two parts. Part I defines Appendix O as a description of SLD icing conditions in which the drop median volume diameter (MVD) is less than or greater than 40 Î¼m, the maximum mean effective drop diameter (MED) of Appendix C continuous maximum (stratiform clouds) icing conditions. For Appendix O, SLD icing conditions consist of freezing drizzle and freezing rain occurring in and/or below stratiform clouds. Part II defines ice accretions used to show compliance with CS-25 specifications. In Appendix O Part I (meteorology) icing conditions are defined by the parameters of altitude, vertical and horizontal extent, temperature, liquid water content, and water mass distribution as a function of drop diameter distribution. In Appendix O Part II (airframe ice accretions) CS25 requires that the most critical ice accretion in terms of aeroplane performance and handling qualities for each flight phase must be used to show compliance with the applicable aeroplane performance and handling qualities requirements for icing conditions contained in Subpart B (flight) of CS25. Applicants are required to demonstrate that the full range of atmospheric icing conditions specified in part I of Appendix O have been considered, including drop diameter distributions, liquid water content, and temperature appropriate to the flight conditions (for example, configuration, speed, angle of attack, and altitude).
