Condition monitoring (CM) is a critical component of predictive maintenance. It is the process by which one or more parameters of a machine are either periodically measured, or continuously monitored, to identify significant changes that usually are indicative of a failure in progress. This allows the operator to plan maintenance actions focused on avoiding failures and their consequences. Continuous condition monitoring is most often applied to rotating machinery such as fans, compressors, pumps, and combustion engines.
