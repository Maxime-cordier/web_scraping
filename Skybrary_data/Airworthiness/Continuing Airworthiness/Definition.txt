Continuing Airworthiness management is the process by which an aircraft is kept in a condition where it remains airworthy throughout its life - or in other words i.e. technically fit for flight. In the words of ICAO: â€œAll of the processes ensuring that, at any time in its life, an aeroplane complies with the technical conditions fixed to the issue of the Certificate of Airworthiness and is in a condition for safe operation" - source: ICAO Airworthiness Manual [ICAO, 2014]
