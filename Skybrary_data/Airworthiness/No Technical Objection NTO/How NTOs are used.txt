The procedure for granting an NTO requires that the aircraft operator requests this service to the OEM. The acceptance or denial options are exercised by the OEM after several factors are considered which are involved with granting the NTO, the most important of which are items that include airworthiness limitations, certificate maintenance requirements, or otherwise mandated by the applicable airworthiness requirements. Items may not be extended beyond normal scheduling tolerances. The OEM may only issue an NTO letter to confirm it has no objection for example to a flight extension. It is the operator’s task to obtain the actual flight extension from the competent authority. The granting of an NTO letter by an OEM for a ferry flight requires that the aircraft operator requests this service to the OEM, who will consider the request on taking into account factors such as the distance requested to be flown to reach the maintenance facility, any inspection items which may have lapsed, the amount of time the aircraft has been inactive, where and how it has been stored, as well as other information necessary to determine the current technical state of the aircraft. Provided it can be issued, the NTO letter will be given to the operator outlying what (if any) inspections or other maintenance actions need to be accomplished prior to the ferry flight and what inspections can be deferred and the duration of deferment. This will allow the operator the flexibility to relocate the aircraft to a maintenance facility. It is the operator’s task to obtain the ferry flight permit from the competent authority.
