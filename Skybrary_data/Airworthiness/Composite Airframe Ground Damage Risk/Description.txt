Ramp accidents cost airlines significant amounts of money but these accidents only become a flight safety risk if they represent an airworthiness risk and are either undetected or unreported. The increasing use of composite materials in aircraft manufacturing may lead to increased risk because often, after being hit, a composite surface returns to its original shape and the damage underneath is not visible to the naked eye. A simple ‘tap’ test might not detect a delamination at an early stage or in specific areas. The operational safety emphases are: Avoidance - reduce the risk of damage occurring.. Correct Response to events which may have caused damage. Education - explaining to personnel why it is important to report accidents even if there is no visible evidence of damage..
