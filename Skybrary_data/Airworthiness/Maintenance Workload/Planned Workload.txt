All of the tasks mentioned above can be clearly defined – what to do, when to do it, how often, how to do it, and what to do it with. These will be presented in the approved maintenance programme and manual; these tasks define the majority of the maintenance workload and can be “planned” for and “scheduled”. For example, the completion of various inspections and checks (A, C & D checks) is a legal requirement that must be fulfilled within limits of numbers of flight cycles, hours flown and/or time expired since previous inspection or check. These limits will vary between aircraft types and models, as will the contents of each inspection and check. In order to fulfil the operational flying programme some inspections and checks (and elements thereof) can be brought forward in time and/or conducted more frequently. In this way a maintenance organisation (or department) managing a mixed fleet of aircraft will be able to spread workload and programme “blocks of time” months and even years into the future for specific activities. Aircraft and equipment manufacturers will provide operators with details of manpower requirements for specific tasks, from changing nose-wheel tyres to flushing and cleaning hydraulic systems. Furthermore, in addition to these details, experience will guide maintenance organisations in predicting quite accurately the number of workers they require for each and every planned task and how long it will take them e.g. pre-flight might be 2 technicians for 90-minutes; post-flight may require two workers for 2 hours, and an A-check could take them 21 hours.
