The AIAA paper said, “[Boeing] commercial airplane design philosophy has always been to deliver a safe airframe based on state-of-the-art understanding of the operating environment and structural behavior, Today, this [design] philosophy and associated criteria exist, and are essentially universally accepted, to govern current design practices. “The essential requirement for structural performance (weight control) has challenged design safety factors more than in any other branch of engineering. In turn, this demands the use of high-strength materials and relatively high design and operating stresses.” The design philosophy required robust, durable, damage tolerant, and corrosion-resistant structures — with the airframe designers operating within exacting constraints and essentially no margin for error.
