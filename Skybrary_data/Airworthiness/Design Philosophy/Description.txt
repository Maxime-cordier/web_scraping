Typically, designers responsible for safety-critical elements of aviation — e.g., airframe structures, engines, flight decks, instrumentation, and aircraft flight path automation — must refer to their company’s formal design philosophy and adhere strictly to its current principles and rules. This article cites, as an explanatory example, a design philosophy likely to be familiar to most aviation professionals: one geared to airframe designers who work for aircraft manufacturers. A technical paper by a Boeing subject matter expert — published in 2005 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) — contains insights into how airframe designers work within a clearly established philosophy and well-defined criteria, while considering emerging technology and recognising newly evolving critical design parameters (see Reference). This overview contains a definition, conceptual scope and basic elements (examples) that cover how the design philosophy guides or influences professional decisions and practices — in this case — by teams of aeronautical engineers. Manufacturers of safety-critical aviation products collect, preserve and share lessons learned over time, continually updating goals, safety standards, procedures and practices. The resulting document set — the company’s design philosophy — includes detailed supplemental material tailored for specialist employee/contractor categories, such as airframe designers. Airframe designers access the latest information they need at various stages of their careers and for their daily assessments of safety, product performance and costs.
