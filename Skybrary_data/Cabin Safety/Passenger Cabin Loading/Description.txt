This article is concerned with the loading of aircraft with cabins configured for passenger use. Some passenger aircraft cabins can be re-configured to carry cargo by removal of all, or some, of their seats. Loading of the main cabin in such circumstances raises similar issues of operational safety, and appropriate procedure, as a dedicated freighter version of the same aircraft model and is not considered here.
