The Convention on International Civil Aviation has been signed by 191 States (governments). Titled “Prevention of Spread of Disease”, Article 14 of this Convention commits signatory States to prevent “by means of air navigation” the spread of communicable disease and to consult on this subject with other involved agencies. To assist with the implementation of Article 14, International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) works with the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Air Transport Association (International Air Transport Association (IATA)), Airports Council International (ACI) and several other interested bodies. Effective preparedness planning requires a multi-sector, multi-stakeholder approach and it often involves a different way of working from usual – this can provide a major challenge.
