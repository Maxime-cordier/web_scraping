Several types of insect provide good disease vectors transferring infective material to food or surfaces. Flies and cockroaches present the greatest hazard because of their feeding habits and the sites that they visit. Flies often land on animal faeces where they pick up large numbers of infective material on their hairy bodies. In addition they defecate and vomit previous meals back onto the food as they feed. Cockroaches often live in sewers and commonly feed on infected waste. They hide in the most inaccessible places onboard aircraft and may transfer organisms from their legs and bodies to food and equipment as they move around aircraft. Operators should ensure that they have adequate pest control measures in place. In flight disinsection may also be required to kill insects such as Mosquitoes. Rodents are also common carriers of disease. They can excrete various harmful organisms including salmonella. Contamination may occur from droppings, urine, hairs and surface gnawing. Aircraft operators should ensure systems are in place both to identify possible infestation and provide suitable destruction methods. Galley worktops on which rodents may have walked must be disinfected before use. Food suspected of being contaminated by rodents must be destroyed.
