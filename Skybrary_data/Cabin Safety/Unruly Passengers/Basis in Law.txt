As stated above, the Tokyo Convention makes it unlawful to commit “acts which, whether or not they are offences [against the penal law of a State), may or do jeopardize the safety of the aircraft or of persons or property therein or which jeopardize good order and discipline on board.” The same convention also provides the authority to the Pilot in Command (PIC) to appropriately deal with an unruly passenger and provides protection, under the law, from any subsequent legal proceedings for actions taken against a perpetrator “For actions taken in accordance with this Convention, neither the aircraft commander, any other member of the crew, any passenger, the owner or the operator of the aircraft, nor the person on whose behalf the flight was performed shall be held responsible in any proceeding on account of the treatment undergone by the person against whom the actions were taken.” While the Tokyo Convention contains provisions for the prosecution and offloading of unruly passengers, it has a jurisdictional gap which does not automatically allow most states to prosecute a disruptive passenger who has been removed from an inbound foreign registered aircraft. The PIC can disembark an unruly passenger in any State without coordination with the local law enforcement authorities. In this case, the individual is unlikely to face prosecution in that State unless the State itself has enacted enabling legislation allowing it press charges for the offence. If the PIC wishes the unruly passenger to face prosecution, he must land in a State that is a party to the Tokyo Convention and formally deliver the passenger to the local law authorities. For prosecution to be successful, it must be proven that the passenger committed a serious offence under the law of the State in which the aircraft is registered.
