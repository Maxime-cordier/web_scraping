The following observations and recommendations are contained in Transport Canada AC 700-012, Passenger Safety Briefings: Announcements should focus on safety accountability to enhance passenger awareness and participation in their own safety. Terminology used and direction given should emphasize the importance of listening to and observing safety briefings and announcements and the reasons for their active participation in safety.. During an emergency evacuation, passengers are highly stressed and cabin noise level is high, so this is not an optimal time for understanding or adhering to critical safety information. TSB and TC recommend that pre-landing passenger safety briefings include instructions for passengers to leave their personal effects behind should an evacuation be required on landing.. Pre-takeoff safety briefings and passenger preparation for emergency landing briefings should include instructions for passengers to leave carry-on baggage behind in an evacuation.. Transport Canada, citing ICAO guidance in Doc 10086, makes similar points in Civil Aviation Safety Alert (CASA) No. 2018-04, and says that operators are strongly encouraged to voluntarily adopt ICAO guidance on information and instructions that should be provided to passengers in relation to managing carry-on baggage during an emergency evacuation.. In addition to the above points, ICAO recommends that clear illustrations are included in the safety features card emphasizing that carry-on baggage must not be taken in an emergency evacuation and that crewmembers are trained in human response during emergency situations and in how to encourage passengers to leave their carry-on baggage in the airplane.
