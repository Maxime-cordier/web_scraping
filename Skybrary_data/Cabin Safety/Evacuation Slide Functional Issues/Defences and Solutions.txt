The following are examples of how regulatory standards and guidance materials may help reduce the vulnerability of evacuation slides to functional issues during emergencies: A 2003 European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) standard states: “The device [escape slide] must be capable of resisting puncture and tear of the sliding and walking surfaces and supporting structure from objects normally carried or worn by passengers that could result in collapse of the device, prevent the device from performing its intended function, or both.”. EASA regulations require that the inflation system must be connected to the escape slide and ready for instant use; the inflation mechanism must minimise leakage due to back pressure after inflation; and the system design must prevent ingestion of small foreign objects to prevent an inflation failure or malfunction. Pressure-relief valves, if installed, must be unrestricted (i.e., not blocked by debris) to prevent damage to air chambers by overpressure.. The EASA standard also states: “[The evacuation slide, slide/raft and combination ramp/slide] must be so constructed as to permit their use with ground personnel assistance as a non-inflatable device in the event of puncture or tear which may render the device incapable of holding air and sustaining inflation. … If the device is of a multiple-inflatable compartment construction, loss of any one of these compartments must not render the device totally unuseable.”. In its 2018 summary of advances relevant to functional issues with slides, the Royal Aeronautical Society and the Honourable Company of Air Pilots, stated: “Aeroplane evacuation facilities have developed significantly over the years and many improvements have been made to emergency exits, including the installation of ‘power-assist’ systems to make exit operation easier and faster. This is especially the case for floor level exits on larger aeroplanes, many of which have large and heavy exits and some that need significant force to open and to deploy [automatically inflated] evacuation slides.”.
