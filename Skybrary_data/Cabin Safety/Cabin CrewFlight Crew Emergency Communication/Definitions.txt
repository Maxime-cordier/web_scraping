Ineffective Emergency Communication — This outcome may be attributed to issues such as: pilots or flight attendants failing to share critical information; unwarranted delays before communicating about an imminent threat to safety; misjudgments or misinterpretations of what someone observed; imprecise or incorrect terminology; or, significant errors while passing safety-critical information among flight deck/cabin crewmembers under high stress. Rapid Disembarkation — Also called rapid deplaning, this procedure means the expedited exiting of passengers and crew from a parked aircraft utilizing the boarding entrance(s) and the associated airport infrastructure (airbridge, jetway or boarding stairs) or the aircraft airstairs. Emergency Evacuation — This means the most expeditious actions and commands possible are required compared with a rapid deplaning event. The procedure requires using all available exits to empty the aircraft of occupants as quickly as possible.
