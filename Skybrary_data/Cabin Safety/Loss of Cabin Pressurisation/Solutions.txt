In the case of a deliberate depressurisation, the crew should be on oxygen before the depressurisation commences.. Emergency Descent. In the case of an uncontrolled depressurisation, the crew will want to descend immediately to an altitude at which they and the passengers can breathe without supplementary oxygen - usually given as 10,000 feet amsl subject to adequate terrain clearance..
