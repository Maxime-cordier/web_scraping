Potentially hazardous turbulence in the wake of an aircraft in flight is principally caused by wing tip vortices. This type of turbulence is significant because wing tip vortices decay quite slowly and can produce a significant rotational influence on an aircraft encountering them for several minutes after they have been generated. The origin of counter-rotating wing tip vortices is a direct and automatic consequence of the generation of lift by a wing. Lift is generated by the creation of a pressure differential over the wing surface. The lowest pressure occurs over the upper wing surface and the highest pressure under the wing. This pressure differential triggers the roll up of the airflow aft of the wing resulting in swirling air masses trailing downstream of the wing tips. After the roll up is completed, the wake consists of two counter-rotating cylindrical vortices. The strength of the vortex is governed by the weight, speed, and shape of the wing of the generating aircraft. Once formed, vortices descend until they decay. Under certain meteorological conditions such as stable stratified atmosphere and temperature inversion, the wake vortices have reduced descent speed and decay faster. The longest-lived vortices are observed in non-turbulent and neutrally stratified environments.
