A pilot support programme (sometimes referred to as "Pilot Assistance Program") aims to assist and support flight crew members in recognising, coping with, and overcoming any problem which might negatively affect their ability to safely exercise the privileges of their licence. It provides peer support to fellow pilots, offering referral to professional resources when appropriate, while upholding strict confidentiality and Just Culture principles.
