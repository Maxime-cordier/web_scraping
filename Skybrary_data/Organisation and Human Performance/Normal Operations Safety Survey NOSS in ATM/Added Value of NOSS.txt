Conventional safety data collection programmes mainly present data from abnormal operations, i.e. data about situations that went wrong, or failed system/human performance data. Furthermore, data collection is traditionally outcome-driven, i.e. some triggering event must take place in order for the programme to capture safety data. NOSS provides data about normal situations, i.e. where situations resulted in uneventful outcomes, or successful system/human performance data. The NOSS data include information about the effect of specific countermeasures on managing threats, errors and/or undesired states, which is an indication of the success of existing safety strategies in the operations of the organisation. Furthermore, NOSS data are process-driven, i.e. there is no need for a triggering event to take place in order for the programme to capture safety data.
