The observers for a NOSS programme are selected from the pool of qualified air traffic controllers in the organisation. This selection may involve a joint effort by staff representatives and the management of the organisation. Experience has shown that observers provide optimal data when observing in a setting outside the one they normally work in; therefore, consideration should be given to selecting candidates from other facilities or positions than the one(s) where the NOSS will be held. Candidate observers may also be selected from the (non-operational) instructor group in the organisation, or from outside the organisation. As a general guideline the number of operationally qualified observers should be no less than 80 per cent of the total number of observers. This adds to an enhanced perception of the validity of the data because the data are collected by peers rather than “outsiders”. The observations are performed by single (individual) observers.
