All data collected by the observers are reported in a de-identified format in order to guarantee the anonymity of the controllers involved. After all data have been collected, a “data verification round table” is held in which selected observers and key staff from the organisation verify all received reports and the coding of the threats, errors and undesired states as applied by the observers. Specialists subsequently analyse the data. Next a detailed report of the results and findings from the NOSS is presented to the management of the organisation.
