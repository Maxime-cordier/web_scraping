A tandem rotor helicopter has two main rotor systems and no tail rotor. Usually the rear rotor is mounted at a higher position than the front rotor, and the two are designed to avoid the blades colliding, should they flex into the other rotor’s pathway. The rotor discs are slightly tilted toward each other to provide control along the vertical axis during the hover. This configuration, which is mainly used for larger helicopters, has the advantage of being able to support more weight with shorter blades. The smaller rotor disc area is compensated by having two rotors. The anti-torque function is performed by the counter-rotating rotors, with each cancelling out the other’s torque, so all of the power from the power-plants is employed for lift. Tandem helicopters are typically powerful and fast.The design of the drive and control system are more complicated than the ones of a single main rotor helicopter.
