It has been found that, like fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters acquire a strong negative charge when they fly through air because of static charging. This is normally discharged once back in contact with the Earth’s surface, but if an aircraft comes close to a positively-charged region in a thunderstorm cell then there is potential for a lightning strike to be triggered to and through the helicopter. It is hypothesised that triggered lightning strikes may occur when a helicopter flies: into a positively charged base of a Cb cloud. under the positively charged anvil of a Cb cloud. from a positively charged region of cloud to a negatively charged one.. It has been found that most, but not absolutely all, triggered strikes are positively charged and it is noted that positively charged regions of a Cb cloud are located close to the freezing level (the 0ºC isotherm) where the rate of change from the frozen to liquid moisture state, which leads to the separation of electrical charges, is at its greatest.
