The part of the helicopter struck is almost always the main or tail rotor blades. Although the immediate effect on safety has so far appeared to be limited, the amount of damage caused has often been high with affected rotor blades found after flight to be beyond repair and rectification expensive. Operationally, since a lightning strike to most helicopters requires a landing at the nearest suitable location as the helicopter is almost certain to have sustained some damage, the disruption caused is also likely to be expensive.
