One external research report, part of the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority’s (U.K. CAA’s) work on HTAWS enhancements, sought to mitigate human factors issues discovered in a few North Sea accidents where first-generation HTAWS were on board. The authors summed up: “Controlled flight into terrain is a major cause of accidents in helicopter operations which terrain awareness warning systems (TAWS) could help to address. “However, existing HTAWS are not considered to be optimised for the offshore operations undertaken by the majority of the UK’s medium/large helicopter fleet, and would have offered little or no protection in the case of the accident scenarios that have been experienced in that environment. The objective of the research was therefore to seek to identify improvements to HTAWS to improve warning times for offshore operations without incurring an undue number of nuisance alerts.”
