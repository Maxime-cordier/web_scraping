PinS concept for departures can be summarized as follows: The pilot proceeds using visual references from the FATO to a Point in Space called the IDF (Initial Departure Fix). This part of the operation is the visual flight phase. PinS procedures are built based on visual criteria and are defined according to ICAO Doc 8168 Volume lI [RD 9]. Two types of visual flight phase are possible: “proceed visually” procedure - performed under IFR following a published visual flight procedure. Does not require VMC. The pilot climbs towards the IDF to or above the authorized altitude (IDF MCA) and navigates by visual reference to the earth’s surface; the visibility shall be sufficient to see and avoid obstacles. “proceed VFR” procedure - performed under VFR and requires VMC.. “proceed visually” procedure - performed under IFR following a published visual flight procedure. Does not require VMC. The pilot climbs towards the IDF to or above the authorized altitude (IDF MCA) and navigates by visual reference to the earth’s surface; the visibility shall be sufficient to see and avoid obstacles.. “proceed VFR” procedure - performed under VFR and requires VMC.. The instrument flight phase starts once the pilot has passed the IDF at or above a certain altitude (MCA: Minimum Crossing Altitude).. The instrument flight phase starts once the pilot has passed the IDF at or above a certain altitude (MCA: Minimum Crossing Altitude).
