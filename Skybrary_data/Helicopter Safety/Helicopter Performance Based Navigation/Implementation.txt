On the one hand the available technology and the equipment installed on commercial helicopters, in particular those of the latest generations, are making it easier to transition to PBN. On the other hand, however, the pace of implementation of PBN procedures by helicopter operators has been so far relatively slow. Some critical mass has developed, as the industry in general supports the PBN concept. There have been some research and development programmes in Europe, including the PBN Rotorcraft Operations under Demonstration (PROuD) project with the objective of demonstrating that helicopter Point in Space (PinS) procedures implementation can allow access to heliports in difficult environments when there is reduced visibility. This project has demonstrated in live trial environments how the adoption of PBN flight procedures improves the safety and reliability of search and rescue (SAR) operations and landing site accessibility in challenging environments, such as in adverse weather conditions and mountainous areas.
