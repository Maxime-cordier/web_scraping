A controlled ditching might be made in anticipation of a loss of control or its actual onset. Other potential causes of an impending loss of control which could prompt a decision to ditch include uncontrollable and developing fire or structural failure and, for rotary wing aircraft over water, indications of imminent power transmission failure or loss of rotor integrity for which the procedural response is 'Land Immediately'. Rotary wing aircraft may also need to 'land immediately' for other reasons, including the failure of a single engine.
