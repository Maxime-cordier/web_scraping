liferafts carried without undue delay. After a headcount, these should be detached from the helicopter to avoid being dragged down should the helicopter then capsize fully - but attached to each other if more than one is being used. Where a liferaft “long line” has a shear type connection that is designed to tear free if the helicopter sinks, remaining attached to the helicopter can be considered, to remain close to the scene of the accident where SAR (Search And Rescue) will begin its search and where surface oil/debris and aircraft provide added visual cues for the searchers. There will be a survival knife in the liferaft’s kitbag if it becomes necessary to cut free from the aircraft. In all cases, if there is more than one liferaft they should be attached to each other. Deploy the liferaft sea anchor to improve its stability and, as early as possible, administer seasickness tablets to everyone; it is almost inevitable that when one person vomits the rest will follow, increasing the survivors’ fatigue and dehydration and reducing their morale..
