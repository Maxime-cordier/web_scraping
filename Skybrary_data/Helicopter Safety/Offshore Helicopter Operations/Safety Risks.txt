There are a number of risks associated with offshore helicopter operations: Offshore helicopter operations are often conducted in adverse weather.. Winds are generally stronger over water than over land, thus making the helicopter harder to control.. Offshore wind turbines pose a serious threat to helicopters due to their large moving rotor blades (with a length ranging from 30m to 50m).. High chance of ditching â€“ many system malfunctions have the potential to result in a ditching.. VTOL capabilities are usually limited to helipads, which restricts one of the main inherent helicopter advantages.. Autorotation (which can otherwise be a very helpful safety feature) offers limited benefits compared to onshore situations.. Safety systems are often destroyed or disabled on impact.. Harsh conditions in water can easily cause a helicopter to capsize.. Harsh conditions and destroyed or disabled safety and rescue systems reduce the chances of survivors being saved.. Most fatalities are caused by drowning as occupants are often unable to leave the helicopter in time..
