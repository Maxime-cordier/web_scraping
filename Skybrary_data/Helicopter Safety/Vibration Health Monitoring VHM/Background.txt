Due to their design, helicopters are potentially vulnerable to catastrophic mechanical failures because of the number of single-load-path critical parts within the rotor and rotor drive systems and the reduced redundancy within their design. This vulnerability and high accident rates experienced in the 1970s and 1980s led to the development of systems able to monitor the health and integrity of rotors and rotor drive systems. (EASA RMT) Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) are designed to automatically monitor the health of mechanical components in a helicopter, as well as usage of the airframe and its dynamic components. HUMS enable aircraft to record structural and transmission usage, transmission vibrations, rotor track and balance information, and engine power assurance data. HUMS not only monitor the health of rotating components such as gearboxes, bearings, shafts, engines and rotors through vibration but also can record parametric data from the aircraftâ€™s bus for usage and event analysis. Subtle changes in vibration are recorded in flight, visualized on the HUMS ground station compute, and evaluated by technicians. The intelligence gained from the use of HUMS allows aircraft maintainers and fleet operators to make informed decisions about flying and maintaining their aircraft. (IHST) Vibration Health Monitoring (VHM) systems are an element of HUMS. Research and statistics show that HUMS and VHM have significantly reduced the accident rate in rotorcraft since their introduction into North Sea operations in the early 1990s. As a result of this success, the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority mandated HUMS (CAP 753) in aircraft that carry nine or more passengers. Studies have also concluded that these systems were capable of successfully detecting approximately 70% of the failure modes that occurred on components that the system was designed to monitor. (IHST)
