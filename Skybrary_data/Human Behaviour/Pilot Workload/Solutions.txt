Pilots: Commence preparation for high workload periods as soon as possible;. Attempt to anticipate possible changes in clearance;. Ensure that both pilots listen to critical messages.. ATCOs: Give clearances, including re-clearances, in good time, if possible anticipating periods of high pilot workload;. Where possible, avoid late changes to a clearance especially where the change necessitates lengthy re-briefing by pilots (e.g. change of take-off runway, change of standard instrument departure (SID), change of landing runway).. Pilots and ATCOs: Use standard phraseology and insist on the correct read-back procedure..
