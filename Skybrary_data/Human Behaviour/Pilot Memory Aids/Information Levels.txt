Pilot memory aids are used for general through to specific purposes. An example of a general memory aid may be the aphorism Aviate, Navigate, Communicate – this is a reminder of priorities and applies in any situation of uncertainty and emergency. It emphasises the correct and safe priorities, and can prevent pilots from becoming fixated on an issue of minor importance. An example of a moderately specific memory aid may be the acronym Hasell which can be used prior to performing acrobatic manoeuvres - Height, Airframe, Security, Engine, Location, Look-out. These checks are “best practice” and not necessarily a legal requirement. An example of a very specific memory aid might be an acronym for the emergency initial actions for an engine fire - SID – Shutdown engine, Isolate engine, Discharge fire suppressant. Pilots flying simple aircraft (balloons, gliders, sports & leisure aircraft) and operating in a limited number of ways and environments, will tend to conduct all checks (and drills), both routine and emergency, from memory – remembered through the use of mnemonics. However, as the complexity of both aircraft and operations increase, pilots rely more on written procedures and checklists, including Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) displays such as Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) or Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS). In commercial operations pilots tend to rely on memory aids more for improving their train of thought and focus when dealing with problems, assessing action options, and before making decisions, rather than for completing checklists. Furthermore, human factors principles dictate a challenge-and-response process between two crewmembers for conducting checklists and drills, in recognition of the susceptibility of memory to failure at critical moments.
