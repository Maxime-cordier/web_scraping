Stress management is an important skill for the air traffic controllers to hone so that they can adequately cope with stress and prevent it from overwhelming their ability to respond properly at work. As the stress is a mechanism that can sometimes over-stimulate the nervous system, it is difficult to control, but it is not entirely impossible. Specialists say that the first step in coping is to identify stressors and the symptoms that occur after exposure to those stressors. Coping efforts can be focused toward the stressor or the emotions that arise as a result of stress, but the most effective strategy is to deal with both the stressor and its emotional impact. Reducing the negative emotional impact of the stressor removes many of the barriers that obstruct the problem-solving thought processes. Some examples of stress management techniques are: Recognize the potential signs and symptoms of stress. Be proactive in removing the cause of stress (e.g. assign more priority to the short term conflict first before controlling other aircraft etc.). Removing yourself from the stressful situation by knowing one's own capabilities (e.g. calling out for help from colleagues if in a very complex ATC scenario). Prioritise actions. Do not be over focused in finishing the mission at any cost and regardless of the situation. Be current with all existing procedures at the workplace.
