Where established procedures exist, they should be followed unless exceptional, overriding circumstances exist. Where an established procedure does not exist, pilots and controllers should not attempt to find a procedure which resembles the one which is missing; following a procedure which was not designed for the existing situation may have unforeseeable and undesirable results. In the absence of an established procedure, pilots and controllers should exercise their judgement to the best of their abilities, based on experience, skills and knowledge. Occasionally, aviation personnel may intentionally choose not to follow an established procedure, or to omit certain actions listed in a procedure. This may occur because of negligence, ignorance, complacency, or overconfidence (“cutting corners” syndrome). Alternatively, intentional breaches of procedure may occur because the procedure is not fit for purpose - in such a situation, pilots/controllers must raise the issue with management as soon as possible (see Inappropriate Procedures). Unintentional inappropriate action sometimes occurs because the pilots or controllers are unaware of or cannot identify an appropriate procedure for the situation, or because of misinformed or wrong judgement.
