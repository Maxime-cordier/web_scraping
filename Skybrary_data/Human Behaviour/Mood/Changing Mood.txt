When it was mentioned earlier in this Article that we can detect or sense others’ moods, then apart from the behaviours, also described above, we tend to achieve this through reading body language. Our moods are openly and unconsciously transmitted through our bodies – posture, motion and facial expression. In summary, when our mood changes, then our body changes to reflect the mood (think what a depressed person looks like). There is ample research available[2] which supports the concept that we can reverse the mood-to-body change process, i.e. by changing our body (posture, motion and facial expressions) first, this can lead to a change in our mood. Instinctively most of us understand this. Recall a time when you were fatigued and lethargic (night-shift, in the cruise, post lunch etc.) and you shook it off by standing, stretching, breathing deeply, perhaps slapping your face and engaging in some activity. A mental challenge can be just as effective as a “run around the block”. Understanding this equation can help with our mood control, as we start work, during work and when returning home from work. Including our body language, and that of others, in our situational scanning may prevent negative moods impacting on the safety of a task.
