EUROCONTROL and partner Flight Safety Foundation continue to encourage aviation professionals to pursue human factors knowledge throughout their careers. Just one year after EUROCONTROL launched its SKYbrary electronic repository in May 2008, the editorial team incorporated an extensive multimedia compendium of knowledge (described with hyperlinks below) called Operator’s Guide to Human Factors in Aviation (OGHFA). The project was initiated by the FSF European Advisory Committee, which includes EUROCONTROL representation. OGHFA still offers a sound introduction to human factors, and enables comparison on SKYbrary of issues in 2009 and now. Content includes briefing notes, supporting checklists and visual training aids, as well as situational examples that present visitors with real life examples based on accidents and serious incidents. During the last five years, 18 separate human factors–related articles have augmented OGHFA (see References with hyperlinks below) on SKYbrary. Current State of Aviation Human Factors In 2014, Thomas B. Sheridan, a retired emeritus professor of engineering and applied psychology in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote that despite steady advances in human factors knowledge, unresolved conflicts between human factors experts and flight deck automation experts remain a serious cause for concern. Sheridan said, “The pressure from the computer community is always to make automation ‘smarter’ … but much research in human factors has shown that removing the human from the decision loop can produce reduced situation awareness, complacency, over-reliance on the automation, and unbalanced workload. … The implication from much research is that some intermediate level between full automation (what is possible) and full human control is best. … It seems to me that system developers need some automation policy with clear guidelines allocating authority and responsibility.”
