Written forms of communication are widely used in aviation and the information communicated can be critical to safety. The variety of information communicated is broad, and the medium used for writing also varies. For example, written communication in aviation, and its media, includes items from the following list: Regulations. Procedures. Technical Drawings. Engineering Manuals and Job Cards. Aircraft and Flight Manuals. Aerodrome Manuals. Aircraft Performance Graphs and Tables. Aircraft Load Sheets. Checklists. Flight Reference Cards / Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). Flight Progress Strips. ATC HMI. Aeronautical Information Publications (AIPs). Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS). Aerodrome Approach, Departure and Taxi Charts. Flight Information (e.g. via EFIS and FMS displays). Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) / Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS). Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC). ACARS. Accident, Incident and Occurrence Reports. etcâ€¦.
