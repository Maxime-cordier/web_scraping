Since the European Aviation Safety Agency Germanwings Flight 9525 Task Force Report recognition of the importance of mental health in aviation has gained a great deal more attention. Mental health problems are present in aviation as in any other industry, and more must be done to identify mental health problems, both during a pilot's career and during the hiring process. It is important to have a wide variety of tests and screening processes to determine the true wellness of pilots. Even though pilots need to have their medical licenses renewed periodically by a certified medical examiner, there is little focus on mental health. There is no follow-up by a psychologist or psychiatrist unless the pilot requests such a follow-up, which is rarely the case. Additionally, in the main, psychiatrists are unfamiliar with the regulations governing pilots suffering from mental health issues. Airlines are familiar with the consequences of mental health, which is why they now administer personality tests during the selection process to identify mental health issues. One example is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). This long questionnaire can identify at-risk candidates, by asking a series of questions, worded differently, about a similar subject. Pilots are aware of the importance of having perfect mental health. As a result, they tend to be defensive about their results, perhaps even more so than indviduals in the non-pilot population, and try not to show signs of any mental health issues.
