The concept of mental health advocacy has been developed to promote the human rights of persons with mental disorders and to reduce the stigma often associated with mental health problems and the resulting discrimination. It consists of actions aimed at changing the major structural and attitudinal barriers to achieving positive mental health outcomes. More recently, the concept of advocacy has been broadened to include the needs and rights of persons with less severe mental disorders and the mental health needs of the general population. Mental health advocacy actions include the following: Raising Awareness – Provide information, education and training; develop support networks for information exchange; provide emotional and instrumental support (e.g., providing facilities for meetings and contacts with other groups); provide mental health services (counselling and professional support), promote the formation of alliances of stakeholders for mental health advocacy; and establish implement review boards.. Prevention - Safeguard the mental health of your workforce by creating an open and caring culture that makes staff feel supported and looked after.. Culture – Create a culture of openness and awareness by encouraging people to talk about mental health. Develop a mental health policy because having a concrete policy reassures employees that their company cares about their well-being..
