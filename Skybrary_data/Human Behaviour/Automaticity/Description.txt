Automaticity is the ability to do things without occupying the mind with the low-level details required, allowing it to become an automatic response pattern or habit. It is usually the result of learning, repetition, and practice. Examples of tasks carried out by muscle memory often involve some degree of automaticity. Examples of automaticity are common activities such as walking, speaking, bicycle-riding, assembly-line work, and driving a car. After an activity is sufficiently practiced, it is possible to focus the mind on other activities or thoughts while undertaking an automatized activity (for example, holding a conversation while driving a car). This is the reason a person can complete a regular journey such as driving to work and subsequently have no memory of the journey. Likewise it is the reason someone might start off on a journey to a particular place but find themselves unintentionally somewhere else that they regularly drive to because the initial part of the route was the same - what some people refer to as "driving on auto-pilot".
