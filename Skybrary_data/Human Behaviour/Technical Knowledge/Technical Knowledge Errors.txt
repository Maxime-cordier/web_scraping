The recall of technical knowledge can be prone to recall errors. The original knowledge could have been taught or interpreted incorrectly, it may have “time-expired”, or it may be so infrequently used that memory is incomplete or impossible. Environmental and human factors may also hinder recall, such as distractions and mental stress. A knowledge-based error can occur when planning and making decisions i.e. the selection of a wrong rule, procedure or technique, possibly based on incorrect analysis due to inadequate technical knowledge. When executing a task, a lack of technical knowledge may lead an operator to react inappropriately to a situation, again due to incorrect analysis from incomplete or incorrect technical knowledge. Furthermore, the inability to recall appropriate technical knowledge can lead to an omission.
