Operational managers or supervisors have a responsibility to monitor for fatigue in the operational staff they manage. They are in a good position to look out for signs of fatigue in their staff and will also be the person who may need to support staff showing symptoms of fatigue. Bearing in mind that an individual may fail to recognise or acknowledge that their performance is being degraded by fatigue, there are outward indications a supervisor or manager should look out for, including: Yawning and generally looking weary, closed eyes or even inability to stay awake.. Less communication or interactions â€“ becoming quieter and more withdrawn.. Asking to carry out quieter or easier roles.. Uncharacteristic task performance, such as inability to manage typical workload levels, an increase in mistakes.. Uncharacteristic behaviours such as reduced motivation, irritability or moodiness.. Although performance can change for other reasons, it is always prudent for a manager or supervisor that detects one or more of the above to explore whether fatigue may be involved. They need to be prepared to take appropriate steps to give the air traffic controller an opportunity to rest.
