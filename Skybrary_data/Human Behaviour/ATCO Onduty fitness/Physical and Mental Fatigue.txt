Fatigue is recognised as one of the major factors that can impair human performance and has been cited as a cause of accidents and incidents in the aviation industry. Physical fatigue concerns the inability to exert force with ones muscles to the degree that would be expected. It may be an overall tiredness of the whole body, or be confined to particular muscle groups. Physical fatigue most commonly results from physical exercise or loss of sleep. Physical fatigue often leads to mental fatigue. Mental fatigue, which may include sleepiness, concerns a general decrease of attention and ability to perform complex, or even quite simple tasks with customary efficiency. Mental fatigue often results from loss or interruption of the normal sleep pattern and is therefore of great concern to pilots and ATCOs, who are frequently required to work early in the morning or at night hours. Sleep patterns are naturally associated with the body's circadian rhythms. Shift patterns can interrupt circadian rhythms so that, for example, it may be difficult for ATCOs on duty in the early hours of the morning or at night to achieve satisfactory rest prior to commencing duty.
