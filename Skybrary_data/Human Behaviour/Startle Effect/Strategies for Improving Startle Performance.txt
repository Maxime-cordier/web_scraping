Researchers have identified a number of strategies that can reduce the negative effects of startle and help improve pilot performance during and immediately following a startle event. These include: Know your aircraft: Develop a sound technical knowledge of your aircraft type and maintain it with regular revision. Maintain handling skills: Be competent and comfortable flying the aircraft "without the automation". Train appropriately: Simulator exercises should be conducted in a constructive manner with a focus on evidence based (most likely) events. However, there should also be constructive use of unexpected critical events. Be cognisant of your surroundings: Develop and maintain effective situational awareness skill-sets. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) should actively monitor the Pilot Flying (PF) and both should actively monitor the aircraft automation. Avoid complacency: Have a healthy expectation and suspicion for things going wrong. Anticipate threats: Utilise effective threat and error management (TEM) strategies. Have a plan: Mentally rehearse or foster crew discussion of a "plan of action" for both common non-normal events, and for the rare, "out of the ordinary" events such as ditching, upset or uncontrollable fire. Adopt a "what would I do if.." mindset.
