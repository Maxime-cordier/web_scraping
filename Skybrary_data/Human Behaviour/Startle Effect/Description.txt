The startle effect includes both the physical and mental responses to a sudden unexpected stimulus. While the physical responses are automatic and virtually instantaneous, the mental responses - the conscious processing and evaluation of the sensory information - can be much slower. In fact, the ability to process the sensory information - to evaluate the situation and take appropriate action - can be seriously impaired or even overwhelmed by the intense physiological responses. These changes in physiological activity include: Cardiovascular System: Heart rate increases, blood pressure rises and coronary arteries dilate to increase the blood supply to brain, limbs and muscles. Respiratory System: Depth and rate of breathing increases providing more oxygen to the body. Endocrine System: Liver releases additional sugar for energy. Adrenal glands release adrenalin. Muscular System: Muscles tense in readiness for immediate action. Excretory System: Sweat production increases. Nervous System: Brain activity changes, reactions become less reasoned and more instinctive.
