With the implementation of the ICAO language proficiency requirements in 2011, the international aeronautical community took a significant step towards improving safety in aviation. Now all air traffic controllers and pilots operating in internationally designated airspace and on international air routes have to demonstrate their proficiency in the language(s) they have for aeronautical communication.[1] In order to maintain the operational standard, air traffic controllers and pilots must achieve at least level 4 according to ICAOâ€™s language proficiency requirements. Their language proficiency is a licence endorsement without which air traffic control and pilot licences cannot be issued.[2] ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for Language Proficiency Requirements (LPR) - requires organisations worldwide to ensure that the language proficiency tests they work with are reliable, effective and appropriate for the aviation industry.[1] ELPAC is the first English Language Proficiency test to achieve full ICAO recognition since 2012.[3]
