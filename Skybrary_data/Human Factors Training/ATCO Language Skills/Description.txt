Many of the worldâ€™s air traffic controllers (ATCOs) must have the latest specified level of proficiency in the English language to safely accomplish their duties. Therefore, the staff of air navigation service providers (ANSPs) should be provided with courses focused on language instead of procedures and should include phraseology and the use of plain English. Language performance requirements (LPRs) can include: The ability to produce intelligible messages in unusual situations;. The ability to communicate using plain language in English and in other official national languages even under stress;. Understanding and making appropriate responses to pilot messages (spoken and written);. Adhering to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) phraseology; and,. Resolving misunderstanding in communication (e.g., by understanding cultural differences).. The English language proficiency of student air traffic controllers should be at an agreed minimum level prior to their employment in an international environment. This will allow them to carry out their assigned tasks ensuring the safety and expeditious handling of the affected air traffic. Regional and national aviation authorities (NAAs) are the arbiters of exactly how to implement English proficiency for their ATCOs and ANSPs. They also must report to ICAO any differences between their practices and the international standards and recommended practices, and disclose in their Aeronautical Information Publication the radiotelephony languages that pilots from other countries will encounter at their aerodromes. With the same rationale that English has been designated the default language for international pilots whose first language is not English, regulators and ANSPs also must make provisions for ATCOs to decide when safe communication dictates that they speak an official language of their country according to the needs, preferences and circumstances of pilots in their airspace.
