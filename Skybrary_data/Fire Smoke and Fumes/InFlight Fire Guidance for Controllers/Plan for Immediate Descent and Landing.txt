Many smoke and fire warnings turn out to be spurious. However, if it is a real fire, then a flight crew does not have very long to deal with the situation - time is critical. The crew will commence descent immediately and begin planning for an emergency landing. The crew will not necessarily wait for clearance to descend. If they do ask for clearance for descent and vectors to the closest airfield and if that clearance is not immediately forthcoming, they will likely commence descent without clearance. Take any measure deemed necessary to ensure unrestricted descent to the flight experiencing an in-flight fire emergency. If an emergency descent is executed, the aircraft must not descend below the lowest published Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) which will provide a minimum vertical clearance of 300m (1000 ft) or in designated mountainous terrain 600m (2000 ft) above all obstacles located in the area specified. Putting an aircraft on the ground within 15 minutes of a fire being detected is a challenge for the pilot of a modern passenger jet at cruising altitude, so expect the descent to be rapid. Give clearance for, and expect, the aircraft to take the shortest most direct route to a runway, regardless of the runway in use at the intended landing airfield, arrival procedures, or traffic. In certain circumstances, the flight crew may ask for assistance from another aircraft, such as a military interceptor, to confirm signs of fire on the aircraft (for example where the fire relates to a tail mounted engine). If there is quantifiable evidence of an uncontrolled fire, then there is a real possibility of loss of control in the short term, and therefore the crew may elect to land the aircraft off-field or ditch the aircraft in the sea, on a lake, or shoreline as it may be the only way of surviving the situation.
