It has long been observed that occupant survival in a major aircraft fire, long enough to effect a successful evacuation, requires not only that a fire does not become a directly debilitating hazard but that the associated smoke does not have a similar effect first. It has also frequently been noted that whilst thermal injuries are responsible for around 20% of fatalities in aircraft fires, the majority of the rest are attributable to the direct or indirect effects of exposure to toxic and/or irritant smoke. Whilst means to reduce overall smoke levels have received much attention, the alternative of finding ways to create a survivable personal environment for individual occupants has also been the subject of much research and debate, and this has led to the development of ‘smoke hoods’.
