Within the last twenty years, "heavy duty" smoke hoods have become accepted equipment for Cabin Crew. The purpose is to allow them the opportunity to attempt fire suppression and manage the cabin and its eventual evacuation without becoming affected by smoke gases. A key issue in the design of all smoke hoods is the assumed respiration rate which will vary according to the extent of physical activity by a factor of approximately 3. Because minimum-use duration requirements specified by Regulators for Cabin Crew Smoke Hoods are usually 20 minutes when ‘physically active’, they also incorporate a potassium dioxide cartridge which functions as an oxygen generator as well as filters. They also have a higher quality visor and speech capability such that it is possible to use a megaphone or crew interphone whilst wearing them. Overall, they are of much more substantial construction and provide greater all-round protection for the wearer than the lightweight ‘basic’ smoke hoods which have been persistently proposed for passenger use. Consequentially, they are much heavier and the ability to safely and effectively use them requires specific classroom familiarisation which is routinely included in the initial and recurrent training of aircrew who operate aircraft in which they are carried. Cabin Crew Hoods are carried in sealed containers and, once donned, allow a neck seal to be made and are secured by tapes. The oxygen generator must be manually activated.
