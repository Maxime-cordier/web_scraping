Smoke is a combination of the airborne solid and liquid particulates and gases generated when a material undergoes combustion and the air that they are mixed with. Particulate smoke is a product of incomplete combustion and is generated during both smoldering and flaming combustion, although the nature of particles and their mode of formation are very different.
