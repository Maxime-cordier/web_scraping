AVGAS is broadly similar to automotive gasoline but subject to much more rigorous quality control. The most common form of AVGAS has an octane rating of 100 - octane rating being a measure of the resistance of a fuel to pre-ignition (the chance of combustion occurring before the spark). This flashpoint is the same as that of automotive gasoline and there is a significant danger of combustion if it is not handled carefully. Although there are many more aircraft using AVGAS than use jet fuel, they are almost exclusively light aircraft.
