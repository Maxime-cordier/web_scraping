Prevention of undercarriage fire is rooted in adherence to appropriate procedures and aircraft limitations. Pilots should avoid "riding" the brakes during taxi, make appropriate use of brake temperature indicators and brake fans when installed and adhere to the limitations of the brake energy charts and cooling time requirements when required. Appropriate cooling techniques following a rejected takeoff or leaving the gear extended between multiple stop and go circuit events will help to ensure that critical brake temperatures are not exceeded. If high brake or tyre temperatures are indicated or suspected, the undercarriage should not be retracted after takeoff until an adequate period of time to allow cooling has lapsed. Maintenance procedure and protocols are equally important. Tyre pressure should be checked regularly and corrected as necessary. Consumable brake parts, such as pads and rotors, should be replaced when their wear limits are reached. Old grease should be removed from the axles when wheels are changed and new assemblies should be lubricated in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. Fluid leaks on the undercarriage assembly or in the bay should be repaired without delay.
