A fire is detected on an outboard engine. The crew carry out the appropriate emergency drills, shutting down the engine, cutting off fuel and electrical supply to the engine, and firing extinguishant into the engine, but the fire warning remains. The cabin crew confirm that there are flames visible behind the number 1 engine. The Captain declares a MAYDAY and initiates an immediate maximum rate descent and diversion to the nearest airfield. On landing, the pilot brings the aircraft to a halt, having turned the aircraft such that the burning wing is downwind, and orders an immediate evacuation.
