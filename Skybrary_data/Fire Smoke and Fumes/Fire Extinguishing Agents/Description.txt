There are different classifications of fires differentiated by the type of material that is burning. In general terms, there are four primary fire types: Class A - Ordinary combustibles (solid material fires) - wood, paper, plastic etc,. Class B - Flammable liquids or gases - fuels, alcohol, aerosols,. Class C - Electric fires,. Class D - Combustible metal fires - magnesium, potassium etc.. Fires of all classifications cannot be dealt with in the same way. As a consequence, the airport rescue and fire fighting services (RFFS) must have a variety of fire suppression tools at their disposal. This article identifies the three primary categories of fire extinguishing agents currently used by the RFFS in dealing with aircraft fires. These categories are: Primary Agents. Supplementary Agents. Other Agents. For information about the portable fire extinguishers carried on board of the aircraft together with the automated aircraft fire extinguishing systems see the dedicated article on SKYbrary: Aircraft Fire Extinguishing Systems
