Best practice is to follow the following guidelines using the mnemonic ASSIST: A - Ensure that the reported emergency is well-understood and acknowledged; S - Establish and maintain separation from other traffic and terrain; S - Impose silence on your control frequency, if necessary; and do not delay or disturb urgent cockpit action by unnecessary transmissions; I - Inform your supervisor and other sectors, units and airports as appropriate; S - Provide maximum support to the flight crew; and, T - Allow the flight crew sufficient time to manage the emergency. The controller should be prepared to: Acknowledge emergency on RTF. Inform the crew about the nearest suitable aerodrome and provide alternate aerodrome details and weather information as soon as possible. Ask for number of Persons On Board (POB). Ask if there are dangerous goods on board. Inform the landing aerodrome of the inbound traffic with engine/APU on fire. Inform the crew if fire/smoke is observed. Offer the pilot an extended final approach. Clear the runway according to local instructions. Keep the safety strip clear. Ensure that a go-around is not necessary due to ATC reasons. Anticipate the potential for overheated brakes and burst tire. Expect a blocked runway. Expect positioning of the aircraft with the burning engine downwind on the runway and immediate evacuation. Ensure that towing equipment is on stand-by as appropriate. In case of forced landing, record last known position and time.
