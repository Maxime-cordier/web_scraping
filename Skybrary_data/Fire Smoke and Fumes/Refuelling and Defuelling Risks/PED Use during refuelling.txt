There is a risk that a PED (personal electronic device) may create or induce a spark of sufficient intensity to ignite fuel vapour released during fuelling but it is extremely remote under normal circumstances. A particular concern is the proliferation of below-specification mobile telephone batteries that have the potential to fail dangerously. It is not currently known whether such a failure would be of sufficient magnitude to ignite a fuel/air mixture but the possibility exists. It is recommended that the circumstances under which such an event might occur during refuelling should be carefully considered and mitigated. It also appears that PEDs close to or on board modern aircraft can interfere with fuel gauges and some navigation equipment and may cause false fire warnings in cargo/baggage holds. Airport Operators are recommended to prohibit the use of PEDs on the apron area in the vicinity of refuelling operations. Passengers boarding or disembarking an aircraft other than via an airbridge should be discouraged from using PEDs.
