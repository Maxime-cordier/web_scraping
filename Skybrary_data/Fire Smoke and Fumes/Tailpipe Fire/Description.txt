A jet engine tailpipe fire, also referred to as an internal fire, is one which occurs within the normal gas flow path of the engine. A tailpipe fire will only occur on the ground and only during engine start or during engine shutdown. It is difficult for the flight deck crew to identify a tailpipe fire as its location within the engine core will not result in activation of engine fire warning systems. Flight deck indications are limited to the potential of an abnormal rise in exhaust gas temperature (EGT), turbine inlet temperature (TIT) or interstage turbine temperature (ITT) as appropriate to the aircraft in question.
