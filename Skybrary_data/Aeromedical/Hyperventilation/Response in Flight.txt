In flight it can be difficult to distinguish between the symptoms of hyperventilation from those of hypoxia. Therefore, the worst case must be assumed and the response must be the same as for hypoxia: follow your approved procedures for hypoxia in line with your training. Such drills may cover the following points: immediate donning of oxygen mask on suspicion of any symptoms. ensuring oxygen is 100% and flow is appropriate. slowing and deepening the breathing. check oxygen system for connection, leaks and proper functioning. check for potential sources of Hypoxia – e.g. pressurisation, smoke and fumes etc…. Warn others. Help others don their Oxygen masks and check proper functioning. Consider informing Air Traffic Control (important for solo pilots). Above 10,000ft altitude, if one crewmember is Hyperventilating, the other crewmembers should also assume it could be due to Hypoxia and also complete the Hypoxia response. It is usual to don your own mask and establish oxygen flow before helping others.
