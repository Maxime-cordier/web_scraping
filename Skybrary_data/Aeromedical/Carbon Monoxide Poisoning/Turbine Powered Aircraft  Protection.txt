On the ground, the solution to external sources of CO entering the cabin and flight deck is to close doors and hatches. The air-conditioning system can either be used to ventilate the cabin or shut-off to prevent further pollution, depending on the location of the source. Overall, the effective application of mandatory maintenance programmes, quality assurance and safety systems, and routine inspections and cleaning programmes, significantly reduce the chances of any contaminant (including CO) entering the aircraft from the engines and Auxiliary Power Unit via the bleed air system[4]. Because CO poisoning is not considered a risk to flight crew and passengers in large jet and turboprop aircraft, and there is no mandated requirement or means of detecting CO and giving warning, there are no specific emergency procedures that can be employed. However, there are operational and emergency procedures to protect against hypoxia and fire, smoke and fumes. As the presence of unhealthy levels of CO is only likely to occur in conjunction with Fire, smoke and fumes, these procedures will offer the best protection.
