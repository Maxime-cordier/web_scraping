The best form of protection against CO poisoning is to avoid exposure. This is best achieved by the application of an effective maintenance programme in compliance with current regulations and manufacturers guidelines, and applied by appropriately qualified and licensed engineers and technicians. Particular attention should be given to the heating and ventilation system to ensure that the exhaust system components and manifolds are not leaking; especially in older aircraft. Because of the risk and severity of consequences associated with CO and piston powered aircraft it is sensible to have a means of CO detection and warning. Various methods are available, from inexpensive single-use spot detectors to fully automatic, reusable, calibrated electronic devices. In January 2022, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommended to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for a second time that the FAA require CO detectors in general aviation aircraft. NTSB said it has identified 31 accidents between 1982 and 2020 attributed to CO poisoning. Twenty-three of those accidents were fatal. If no detection and warning system is available, then it is important that pilots are familiar with the onset symptoms and react immediately. An effective emergency drill may contain the following elements: Turn the cabin heat fully off.. Select maximum rate of fresh air ventilation to the cabin.. Open windows if the environment, flight profile and operating manual permit.. Consider using supplemental oxygen if available and if doing so would not introduce another safety or fire hazard.. Land as soon as possible/practicable.. Inform Air Traffic Control of your concerns and intentions.. Select a leaner fuel mixture if possible.. After landing seek medical attention as soon as possible.. Before continuing the flight, have the aircraft inspected by a certified mechanic.
