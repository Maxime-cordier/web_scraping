An individual's circadian rhythm can be described essentially as the internal biological clock that regulates our body functions, based on our wake/sleep cycle. Circadian rhythms are not only important in determining sleep cycles but also in feeding patterns. There are clearly recognizable patterns of brain-wave activity, hormone production, cell regeneration, and other biological activities linked to each individual's daily cycle. Possibly because days on Earth were longer in the distant past, the circadian cycle is a 25-hour cycle. The risk in aviation is that any time that our normal circadian rhythm is altered or interrupted, physiological and behavioural effects occur. This risk is known as circadian rhythm disruption, or CRD.
