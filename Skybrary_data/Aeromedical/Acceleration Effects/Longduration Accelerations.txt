Long-duration accelerations may result in sensory illusions[1]. The fluid-filled semicircular canals of the vestibular system detect motion in three dimensions. The normal mode of stimulation for these organs (i.e. to register movement) is an abrupt, short-duration acceleration followed immediately by a short deceleration. If the movement (acceleration) is below the threshold of detection, then the brain will not be conscious of any change in speed or direction. An undetected acceleration can result in speed and/or direction changing substantially without either being noticed. There are two main categories (or types) of common spatial disorientation “illusions” that humans are susceptible to in flight: somatogravic – experiencing linear acceleration and deceleration as climbing and descending.. somatogyral – not detecting movement, and experiencing movement in a different (mostly opposite) direction to that actually being flown. Most commonly results in the actual angle-of-bank being different to that being “felt”, or, the direction of turn being opposite to that “felt”..
