The common cold virus is typically transmitted via infected airborne droplets, direct contact with infected nasal secretions, or through direct contact with contaminated objects. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment and can be picked up by people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes, nose or mouth, where infection occurs. Transmission is common in kindergartens and schools due to the close proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home and passed to other family members. Rather than wearing a mask and white gloves every time we leave the house, a more positive and useful approach to prevention (for society, and our colleagues) is to consider how we may each prevent the spread of germs, whether we have an infection or not. Coughing and sneezing into tissues will prevent us expelling droplets into the atmosphere for others to breathe in. Immediate disposal of the tissue will prevent others from coming into direct contact with any mucous. Then immediately washing our hands will prevent us from contaminating any objects that we touch. The UK National Health Service[5] promote this strategy in their campaign to stop the spread of flu, using the slogan CATCH IT, BIN IT, KILL IT. For this strategy to be effective, personal supplies of tissues and anti-bacterial hand wipes or gel need to be available. There is some evidence that people with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to catch colds, and then to suffer further complications. Therefore, maintaining good general health and well-being, through diet, exercise, relaxation, rest and sleep may reduce the risk of catching a common cold, and lessen the impact if a cold is contracted.
