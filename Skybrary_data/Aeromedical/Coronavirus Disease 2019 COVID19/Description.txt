In December 2019, the novel coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, China. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan. The outbreak was first reported on 31 Dec. 2019, and came to wide international attention in January 2020. In February 2020, WHO named the disease caused by the virus “coronavirus disease 2019,” which is abbreviated as COVID-19. On 11 March 2020, WHO declared that COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic and said it was the first time that a pandemic has been sparked by a coronavirus. In a statement issued 5 May 2023, the WHO director general, concurring with the advice of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) Emergency Committee, determined that COVID-19 is "now an established and ongoing health issue which no longer constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). During its deliberations, the IHR Emergency Committee highlighted the decreasing trend in COVID-19 deaths, the decline in COVID-19 related hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions, and the high levels of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2." While acknowledging the uncertainties surrounding the potential evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the committee advised that it is time to transition to long-term management of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of mid-May 2023, nearly 767 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported around the world and there had been more than 6.9 million confirmed deaths.
