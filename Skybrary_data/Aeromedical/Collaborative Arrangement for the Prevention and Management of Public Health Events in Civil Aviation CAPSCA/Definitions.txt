Public health event — Any event that represents an immediate threat to human health and requires prompt action, i.e. the implementation of control and/or mitigation measures to protect the health of the public. (WHO definition). International Health Regulations (2005) — This core WHO document, abbreviated as IHR 2005 and last amended 1 Jan. 2016, defines the organisation’s mission and authority by international agreement, its responsibilities, its high-level relationships with other international entities, and its scope of action. The WHO calls IHR (2005) “the key global instrument for protection against the international spread of disease” that can “prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.”.
