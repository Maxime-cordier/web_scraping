Medicines are frequently used in a preventive capacity e.g. anti-malarial agents, hepatitis vaccines, anti-diarrhoea, and antibiotics. This use is to avoid, or resist, illnesses and symptoms that can negatively affect flight safety; however, the side-effects of such preventive medication itself must also be considered. Not all preventative medicines, in all countries, need to be prescribed.
