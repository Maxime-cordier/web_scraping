Under normal, stable conditions, all gases within the body cavities, tissues or fluids, are in equilibrium with the external environment. A fall in external pressure (rise in altitude) will give rise to pressure gradients between these gases and the external environment, and this gradient will slowly decrease with time until a new balance is reached. If the depressurisation is large and rapid the expanding body gases may cause physical damage to organs and tissues, or give rise to severe pain, such as in the ear. Under normal and stable conditions the partial pressures of the most common gasses (Oxygen, CO2 and Nitrogen) remain in equilibrium. When the external pressure drops, both Oxygen and CO2 are absorbed, diffused or utilised by the body. Whereas Nitrogen ‘emerges’ from solution (tissues and fluids, including blood) and forms bubbles of gas, which take a long time to disperse from the body. It is these bubbles of gas (similar to those in a fizzy drink) which migrate to the joints (in the case of the Bends) and other areas of the body and cause pain.
