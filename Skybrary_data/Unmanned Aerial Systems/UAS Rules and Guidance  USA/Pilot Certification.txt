U.S. drone pilots must possess an FAA-issued remote pilot airman certificate with a small UAS rating, and an FAA-accepted form of personal identification, to operate an sUAS under Part 107. The certificate’s privileges terminate if the remote pilot has not obtained this certificate — or has not completed recurrent training on specified areas of knowledge — within the previous 24 months as required by Part 107.73, “Knowledge and Training.” Part 107 sUAS operators who lack this certificate must be under the direct supervision of a designated remote pilot in command, who must have the ability to immediately take direct control of the flight of the aircraft. A candidate must be at least 16 years old; be able to read, speak, write and understand the English language; and meet health standards — among other criteria — to be considered for issuance of a remote pilot certificate. The certificate can be obtained one of two ways: If the candidate passes an initial aeronautical knowledge test at an FAA-approved knowledge testing center; of. If the candidate has a Part 61 pilot certificate (other than a student pilot certificate), has completed a flight review in the previous 24 months and completes training that covers the areas of knowledge specified in Part 107.74, “Small Unmanned Aircraft System Training.”.
