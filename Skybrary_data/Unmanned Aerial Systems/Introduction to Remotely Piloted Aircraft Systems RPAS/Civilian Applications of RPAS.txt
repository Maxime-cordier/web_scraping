Current civilian applications of small RPAS have antecedents in government-operated and military-operated aircraft from the early 1990s — then popularly called unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones and other names. Small RPAs (small UAs) in the United States as of March 2019 must weigh less than 55 pounds (25 kilogrammes), operate to a maximum altitude of 400 feet above ground level (AGL) and fly at maximum ground speeds of 100 miles per hour (87 knots). Flying higher than 100 feet AGL is permitted if the RPA remains within 400 feet of a structure. The remote pilot-in-command (PIC) and the person manipulating the controls of the small RA must operate with a direct visual line of sight (VLOS) to the small RA; alternatively, the small RA must remain within the VLOS of the PIC’s designated visual observer. Operators and remote pilots frequently apply for and some obtain FAA waivers of several rules, such as waivers that enable nighttime flight, flights above 400 ft AGL, flight beyond VLOS and operation over people. Air traffic control (ATC) accepts from remote pilots/RPAS operators requests for authorization to fly in controlled airspace near airports. To grant an authorization, ATC requires full compliance with Part 107 rules. Examples of RPAS operators’ missions are: Security surveillance;. Emergency response, including involvement in search and rescue (SAR), and delivery of medications and automated external defibrillators (AEDs);. Enabling data communication and broadcast of information in remote areas;. Small package and bulk cargo transport;. Visual, spectral and thermal examination of structures;. Monitoring of linear network infrastructure such as railway tracks, power lines and pipelines;. Photography, videography, cinematography and cartographic survey;. Agricultural fertiliser and chemical application;. Aircraft external maintenance inspection and airport infrastructure inspection; and,. Atmospheric research and documentation of global warming effects..
