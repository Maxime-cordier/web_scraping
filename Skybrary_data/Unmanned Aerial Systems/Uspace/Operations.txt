Before operating in the U-space airspace, UAS operators must comply with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/947. Before each individual flight, the UAS operator must submit an UAS flight authorisation request to its U-space service provider. When ready to start the flight, the UAS operator requests the activation of the authorisation. Upon receiving confirmation from the U-space service provider, the flight may commence. UAS operators must comply with the UAS flight authorisation, including the associated deviation thresholds. The U-space service provider may introduce changes to the authorisation during any phase of the flight. They must inform the UAS operators accordingly. If unable to comply with the applicable flight authorisation deviation thresholds, the UAS operator must request a new authorisation.
