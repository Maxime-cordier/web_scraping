The EUROCONTROL Safety Culture Programme has been running for more than ten years, and there has been an ongoing survey of ten ANSPs to discuss their 'safety culture journeys' - how they got into safety culture, the usefulness of the survey process to ANSPs, and whether they plan to continue. The following video shows an interview for one of the ANSPs, NATS in the UK. The interviewee is Dr David Harrison, NATS Safety Director and also Chair of the CANSO Safety Standing Committee. The interviewer is Barry Kirwan of EUROCONTROL.
