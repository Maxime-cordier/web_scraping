A SMS will not assure safety if it is not used properly, i.e. all staff involved in the provision of ATM services need to be properly aware of its existence, understand its basis, and be motivated to use it. Organisations are managed by organisational practices, which affect both performance and reliability of safety systems. A well-developed SMS can therefore serve as an accelerator of Safety Culture (Reason 1993, 1997). It is not enough for an organisation to have good safety management system, because performance is determined by how organisations actually ‘live’ or ‘act out’ their systems. Thus, an ANSP needs both a SMS and a positive Safety Culture in order to be safe. They are like body and soul and should reinforce each other.
