Since Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster in 1986 where “Safety Culture” term was first applied, the use of the Safety Culture concept has spread to other industries including Oil and Gas, Chemical, Rail, Aviation, Medical, and Air Traffic Management (ATM), where it has recently been applied to at least partly explain both the Überlingen and Milan Linate accidents. Air Traffic Management (ATM) is a very safe industry - both in terms of quantitative measures such as safety occurrence (accident and incident) rates, and qualitative measures such as the perceptions of the travelling public. However, the industry is currently expanding to cope with increased levels of traffic and this is coupled with fundamental objective to improve further its safety performance. Reason (2000) proposed that an organisation’s Safety Culture takes on a profound significance at the point where accident rates reach a “plateau”, i.e. where negative outcome data “bottoms out” at some asymptotic value. In order to go beyond this “low but (seemingly) unassailable” plateau and to continue improvement in safety performance, it is necessary to address the hearts and minds of the management and workers (Lee, 1998). Thus, the ATM system needs to understand how a negative Safety Culture can be a threat, and how it can be managed. Just as the focus in safety occurrence investigation has moved from operator error to systemic failure in recent years, the concept of Safety Culture considers the critical importance of management and individual actions regarding safety, based on their collective values, beliefs and behaviour.
