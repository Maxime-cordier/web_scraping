Organisational literature proposes three types of organisations, depending on how they respond to information on hazards and safety information management: pathological — hide the information;. bureaucratic — restrain the information; and. generative — value the information.. Figure 2 presents the characteristics of three possible organisational cultures. Figure 2. Organisational culture examples. Source: ICAO Doc 9859 According to ICAO SMM, an effective way to promote safe operations is to ensure that an operator has developed an operational environment where all staff feel responsible for and consider the impact of safety on everything they do. This way of thinking must be so deep-rooted in their activities that it truly becomes ‘the way we do business around here’. All decisions, whether by the board of directors, a driver on the ramp, or an engineer, need to consider the implications on safety. Such an operational environment must be generated ‘top down’ and relies on a high degree of trust and respect between workers and management. Workers must believe that they will be supported in any decisions made in the interest of safety. They must also understand that intentional breaches of safety that jeopardize the operation will not be tolerated.
