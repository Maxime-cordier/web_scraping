Contingency Flight Level Allocation Schemes (cFLAS) would generally not allow departures and arrivals from airports within the area concerned. In some circumstances it may be possible to design procedural “corridors” to and from some airports, perhaps with the help of air navigation service providers (ANSPs) of neighbouring states. The viability of these arrangements will be based around a host of factors such as the proximity of the selected airport to a country's borders and the ability of neighbouring states to offer assistance.
