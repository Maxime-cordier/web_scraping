The eruption of the volcano Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland in April and May 2010 demonstrated the vulnerability of the European aviation system in terms of pan-European coordination between States for emergency situations affecting safety. The level of disruption and impact on the air transport industry was unprecedented and required urgent action at both the European and global level. Europe, led by European Commission (EC) and EUROCONTROL, moved swiftly in the institutional area and used lessons learned in this crisis to establish the EACCC on 19 May 2010. In addition to the founding members, EC and EUROCONTROL Directorate Network Management (NM) that were joined very soon by EASA, EACCC’s composition included the EU Presidency and nominated representatives of airspace users, air navigation service providers (ANSPs), military and airports. Along with other regulatory authorities and industry stakeholders the EACCC is actively engaged in ensuring an improved level of preparedness in Europe for volcanic eruptions and other crisis situations. The main role of the EACCC is to support coordination of the response to network crises impacting adversely on aviation, in close cooperation with corresponding structures in States. Its role includes proposing measures and taking initiative to coordinate the response to crisis situations, and in particular acquiring and sharing information with the aviation community decision makers in a timely manner.
