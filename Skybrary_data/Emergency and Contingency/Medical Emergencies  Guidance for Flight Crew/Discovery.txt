Cabin crew may become aware of a passenger in medical distress by direct observation. More often, the situation is brought to their attention by the individual, a travelling companion or another nearby passenger. The first flight attendant at the scene will normally take charge of the patient and alert other cabin crew members who in turn will provide any required assistance inclusive of retrieving any required emergency equipment and advising the Captain of the situation and progressively keeping him/her informed of any changes in patient status.
