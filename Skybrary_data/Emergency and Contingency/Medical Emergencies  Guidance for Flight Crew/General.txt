In-flight medical emergencies can be broadly divided into two categories - injury related or health related situations. Injuries can occur as a result of a turbulence encounter, luggage falling from an overhead bin, an onboard altercation or due to burns or scalds resulting from contact with hot liquids or galley ovens. Health issues for a single passenger can range from fainting or shortness of breath to allergic reaction to missed medication to gastrointestinal issues to stroke, heart attack or even death. In very rare cases, food poisoning or a commutable disease may affect an number of passengers at the same time. The article Public Health and Aviation deals with the circumstances of discovery of a commutable disease while enroute and that situation will not be addressed in this article. When an in-flight medical emergency occurs, immediate access to care is limited. Cabin crew are trained to provide first aid and limited medical assistance but are not qualified to deal with all potential situations. It is, therefore, critical that airlines have protocols in place for actions to be taken in the event of an on-board medical emergency. Adherence to these protocols will help to ensure the best possible outcome for the situation at hand.
