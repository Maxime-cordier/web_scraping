Based on the information provided by the flight attendants, an onboard medical professional or a contracted agency, the Captain will make the decision to either continue the flight to the planned destination or to divert to a closer or otherwise more suitable aerodrome. In general terms, for a given situation, diversion decisions are more likely if there has been no contact with an outside medical service provider. This is due to the fact that a flight attendant, as a non-medical professional, is likely to take the most prudent course of action and over estimate the seriousness of the patient's condition. Even with a qualified medical practitioner on board, for personal liability reasons, that individual is likely to make a diversion recommendation should the case appear at all serious. Irrespective of the continue/divert decision, should the pilot desire ATS priority, declaration of an emergency using the appropriate Emergency Communications protocols should be undertaken without delay.
