The State authorities (including the military authorities), the air navigation services providers (ANSPs) and the Users (airlines and airports) should put in place a process to set the requirements for “Contingency measures”. In this process, the State authorities have primacy in defining the requirements. ANSPs in consultation with airlines and airports develop the appropriate measures to meet these requirements and any additional local business objectives stated in their contingency Policy.
