Deviation from SID - if the engine failure occurs at take-off or after rotation, the crew may follow an Emergency Turn routing and not follow the published SID and any associated noise abatement procedures. Intermediate level-off - if the engine failure occurs during climb out or descent, the crew might elect to level-off the aircraft in order to assess the situation. Descent - the crew may be forced to descend due to an inability to maintain altitude or might decide to descend (gain airspeed and re-start the engine) or to descend due to pressurisation problems connected with the engine failure. Course deviation - the crew might decide to divert to the next suitable or to the alternate aerodrome. Long and high speed approach and landing - due to performance limitations attributed to the engine failure the approach speed might be higher than prescribed, which could consequently may result in non-stabilised approach, runway excursion and blocked runway. Slow turn rates - The turn rate is expected to be slow if it is executed on the inoperative engine side..
