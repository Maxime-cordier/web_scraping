A wide range of practical problems could arise following onboard electrical failure(s). Depending on the type of failure(s), whether it includes loss of all generators (alternators) and battery power only available (power supply reduced to emergency level), some possible effects on crew are: Increased workload. Crew determining the nature and the severity of the problem.. Turning off non-critical electrical items (such as second radio, passenger cabin lighting and recirculation fans and other non essential electrical systems) in order to isolate and identify the source of the problem and / or to reduce the electrical load.. A decision to land at the nearest/most suitable airport.. The worst case related scenario is an on board fire in flight which is caused by an electrical fault and cannot be contained readily by the crew.
