When making the initial emergency call, it is also a good idea to ask ATC for the local Altimeter Pressure Settings - think “Safety Altitude”. Consider the terrain ahead of the aircraft. If the en route terrain is above 10,000 ft, would it be better to turn around? What is your escape route away from the high terrain? - Many operators conduct a cruise brief at top of climb in which one of the points for discussion is contingency plans regarding sections of the route where the minimum safe altitude is above 10,000 ft. For scheduled routes over extended areas of very high minimum safe altitudes, regulatory authorities often require additional crew oxygen availability, higher capacity Chemical Oxygen Generators for the passengers and pre-established escape routes.
