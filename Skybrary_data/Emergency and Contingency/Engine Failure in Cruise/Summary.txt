Modern jet engine design, manufacturing and maintenance practices have resulted in highly reliable engines which have a very low failure rate. That said, failures will occasionally occur. Pilots should be prepared for that eventuality, in any phase of flight, and should be mindful of the aviate, navigate, communicate prioritisation of their immediate actions. Once the emergency has been secured, a timely and appropriate diversion decision will aid in reducing the follow-on risk and help to ensure that a safe outcome for the passengers, crew and aircraft is achieved.
