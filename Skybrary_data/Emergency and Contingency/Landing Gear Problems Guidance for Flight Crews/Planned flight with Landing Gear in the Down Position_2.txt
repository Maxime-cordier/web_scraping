potentially revised destination and alternates - will they be open? Is new en route wind velocity data needed? Consider whether previous performance calculations are still valid such as reduced cruising speed, engine out terrain clearance requirements (drift down), or ETOPS.. Fuel Planning: Increased drag, and flight at lower than normal cruising levels, will result in a significantly higher fuel burn. Fuel consumption with the landing gear locked down is significantly higher than most pilots realise and potential range can be decreased by 2/3rds, due to both limitations on operating altitude and operating speed. It may be necessary to make a refuelling stop en-route if it is still intended to continue to the original destination. Note that most FMS will not give reliable fuel predictions in such a situation. Crews should compare actual fuel consumption and groundspeed achieved figures.. Flight in Icing Conditions. Flight in icing conditions should usually be avoided because any build up of frozen deposits on the extended undercarriage will increase drag and aircraft weight and may also affect the centre of gravity. It should be noted that at a slower speed, ice accretion on the airframe may occur at an increased rate..
