task, which is to bring the aircraft to a safe stop. In the past, a low level ‘flypast’ has sometimes been flown to allow persons on the ground to inspect the landing gear. In certain circumstances, if the inspection is made by appropriately qualified technical personnel, this can be valuable. However, it is a pointless exercise if merely seeking to establish whether one or more landing gear legs are ‘down’ since the issue is not usually whether they are down but whether they are locked down, which cannot be reliably determined by persons on the ground whether qualified or not. The ‘flypast’ option is proscribed or severely qualified in many Operations Manuals because it is not covered in training and would constitute an unmitigated heightened risk in most Safety Management Systems.
