Shallow fog, METAR code MIFG, is a form of radiation fog; a low-lying fog that does not obstruct horizontal visibility at a level 2 m (6 ft) or more above the surface of the earth. Note that while horizontal visibility is not obstructed above 2 m, the fog layer may be significantly thicker than 2 m and that slant visibility -- the visibility from air to ground from the aircraft while approaching the aerodrome -- can be affected.
