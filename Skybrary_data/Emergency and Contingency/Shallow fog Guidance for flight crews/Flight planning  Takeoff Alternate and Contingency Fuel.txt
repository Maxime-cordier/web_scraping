The presence of shallow fog, at the aerodrome of departure, may diminish, or even negate, the ability to land again in the event of an emergency. In the event that shallow fog is present at the point of origin, pilots should consider selecting and filing an appropriate take-off alternate. A forecast condition of shallow fog at destination, while not necessarily requiring the carriage of contingency fuel, is an indicator that there may be low visibility procedures in place that might cause delays. Since radiation fog is associated with high pressure air mass, shallow fog also may be affecting other aerodromes near the destination including normally selected alternates. Furthermore, what may initially be forecast as shallow fog may become more substantial depending on quite minor changes to temperature and surface wind strength. It is therefore prudent to carry extra fuel and to consider alternates further from the destination than might normally be selected.
