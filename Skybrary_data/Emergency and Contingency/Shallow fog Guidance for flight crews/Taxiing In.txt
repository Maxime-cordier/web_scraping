Taxiing from the runway to the apron holds the same challenges and liabilities as were identified previously in the discussion on "Taxi Out". Anticipated taxi routes should be discussed as part of the approach and landing briefing so the crew is fully prepared for taxi as they vacate the runway. Where possible, checklists should be actioned whilst the aircraft is stationary and both pilots should be "heads up" and closely monitoring aircraft position when in motion. Final positioning on the parking stand may be more hazardous than usual as the fog may make it difficult or even impossible to visually clear the parking area. Elements of the Stand Entry Guidance System may not be visible from the flight deck. If any doubt exists, the aircraft should be stopped awaiting further guidance from the ground crew or, if necessary, the aircraft should be shut down and towed onto stand.
