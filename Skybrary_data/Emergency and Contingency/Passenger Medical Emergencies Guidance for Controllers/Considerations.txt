Unlike most other emergency situations (e.g. fire on board, engine failure, etc.), there is usually no abrupt peak in cockpit workload at the moment when a passenger medical emergency occurs. Therefore, it is unlikely that questions for clarification of the situation will be considered as harassment. The risk of not obtaining vital information (by avoiding possibly unnecessary questions) is higher than the risk of hindering crew performance (by too much communication). Be aware, however, that one of the pilots may be occupied with communication with a medical support service or with Company operations, and the remaining pilot may elect to defer the questions until those tasks have been completed.. Focus on information quality rather than speed; there is usually sufficient time to obtain correct data and mishearing can lead to drastic consequences (e.g. “two sick passengers” might sound like “two-six passengers”).. If there is/are suspected case(s) of highly contagious disease on board, a system to deal with the emergency situation should be ensured in coordination with the airport authorities as necessary (e.g. outbreak quarantine measures with restricted/controlled access to the aircraft, aircraft parked at isolated stand etc.) to avoid and to reduce the possibility of an infectious disease outbreak..
