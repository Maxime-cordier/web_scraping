Unless an aircraft is fitted with specific monitoring equipment, crews are unlikely to detect the presence of radioactive material in the atmosphere. Even in the extreme case where aircraft systems might be affected by the electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear explosion, that in itself would not indicate the presence of radioactive material in the vicinity of the aircraft. Furthermore, if an aircraft does encounter a cloud of radioactive material following a nuclear incident or accident, the aircrew and passengers would be unlikely to be affected immediately. Therefore, the aircrew would not be incapacitated and could complete the flight safely.
