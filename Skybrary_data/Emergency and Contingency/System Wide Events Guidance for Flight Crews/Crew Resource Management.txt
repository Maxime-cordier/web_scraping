CRM aspects are the most important part of managing any departure from the intended route. Gathering, collating and evaluating the necessary information is an intensive task requiring crew collaboration. The pace of change of events may affect the performance of less experienced crewmembers. This may be mitigated by clear allocation of well-defined tasks with any new task not being allocated until previous tasks are concluded. Captain and crew should also keep in mind the impact that workload may have on their own decision making capacity. Supernumerary or dead heading crew, if available, may be particularly useful for information gathering. In any case, at least until the necessary information has been gathered and collated and a new plan has been implemented, it is important that discussion between crew members is not allowed to compromise the operation and Sterile Flight Deck principles should be applied. Once again, flying and navigating the aircraft must be the priority and normal monitoring must be maintained. The golden rule is one pilot must devote all their attention to minding the shop while the other(s) work(s) away at all the other stuff. However, it is imperative that the Captain holds regular updates and /or briefings so that all the crew remain in the loop.
