Once the safety of the flight is assured, the welfare of the passengers should be considered. At some point is will be necessary to inform the passengers of the situation. Choose a time when you have a clear and achievable plan for the continuing operation and liaise with the senior cabin crew because they may be bombarded with questions. If time and workload allow, try to anticipate and answer such questions in the announcement. Avoid giving information that may alarm passengers, which is better left until after the aircraft has landed. If the aircraft has access to the internet or is equipped with telephones for passenger use, remember that passengers may obtain information from external sources which they may find alarming. If in-flight announcements disagree with other sources, passengers may lose confidence in the crew. Passengers will be anxious to complete their journey, in most cases to their original destination. The circumstances that caused the SWE may restrict onward travel for some time, in which case provision for food and accommodation will be needed. If circumstances allow, this could be a factor in the choice of landing airfield, both for the benefit of passengers and because the airline may be liable for compensation for any discomfort suffered. In rare cases, political considerations may be significant in that the country of landing may be hostile to passengers who are citizens of another country. If a SWE occurs prior to departure, it will usually be possible to keep the passengers from boarding or to return them to the airport terminal. If this is not possible, some of the same considerations apply in providing passengers with information, food and drink.
