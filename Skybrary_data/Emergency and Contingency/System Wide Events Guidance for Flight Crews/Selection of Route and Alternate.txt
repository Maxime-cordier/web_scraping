A route should be chosen that avoids the area affected by the event and offers an adequate selection of suitable alternates while retaining adequate fuel reserves. As far as possible, avoid areas with bad in-flight weather. Consider terrain clearance on revised routing (including engine out stabilising altitude requirements and drift down profiles). In areas where MSA is above 10,000’, a requirement for and the availability of supplementary oxygen may be a consideration. Your selected landing airfield and required en-route alternates must allow for adequate fuel reserves and they must be available at the relevant ETA; if not it may be possible for this to be arranged through ATC or your operator. Your first choice of alternative route or landing airfield may be unavailable because of saturation by other aircraft affected. Equally your selection of a near alternate when sufficient fuel is available to reach one more distant may adversely affect other flights with less reserves, for example by saturating approach slots or ground facilities such as space to park aircraft. Again, advice may be available from ATC or your operator but your first responsibility is the safety of your aircraft and its occupants. Choosing an alternate with the facilities to handle the aircraft passengers and/or cargo, and from where it will be easier for the company to recover the aircraft and quickly restore schedules, is an important planning consideration. However, mission/commercial considerations must take second place to the need to maintain the safe conduct of the flight. Sometimes landing at a closer non-company airfield where the crew can turn around within FTL may be a better option. Ultimately, the safe conduct of the flight must always be the commander’s and crew’s priority.
