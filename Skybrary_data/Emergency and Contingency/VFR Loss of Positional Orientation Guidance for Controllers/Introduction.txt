Visual navigation conducted under VFR requires a continuous and conscious effort by the pilot to keep visual contact with the ground, maintain awareness of heading, speed and time, and to maintain constant awareness of terrain. The risks of loss of orientation and also somatogravic and somatogyral illusions are particularly high for flights conducted over featureless terrains even in perfect visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
