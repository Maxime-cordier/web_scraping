inquiries point to the probability that the aircraft is in distress, or when the fuel on board is considered to be exhausted, or to be insufficient to enable the aircraft to reach safety, or when information is received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the aircraft has been impaired to the extent that a forced landing is likely, or when information is received or it is reasonably certain that the aircraft is about to make or has made a forced landing,. following the alert phase, further unsuccessful attempts to establish communication with the aircraft and more widespread unsuccessful inquiries point to the probability that the aircraft is in distress, or when. the fuel on board is considered to be exhausted, or to be insufficient to enable the aircraft to reach safety, or when. information is received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the aircraft has been impaired to the extent that a forced landing is likely, or when. information is received or it is reasonably certain that the aircraft is about to make or has made a forced landing,. The above does not apply when there is reasonable certainty that the aircraft and its occupants are not threatened by grave and imminent danger and do not require immediate assistance. All information given to the rescue coordination centre is normally communicated to the aircraft operator as well. If considered practicable by the ATS unit, the aircraft operator may be notified first. Other aircraft in the vicinity of the emergency situation are also informed about it except in case of known or suspected act of unlawful interference. In such situations, the ATS unit would not refer to the nature of the emergency unless this is done by the aircraft involved and it is certain that doing so will not aggravate the situation.
