Possible effects of adverse weather avoidance include: Pilots may be unwilling to execute a turn, as instructed by the controller to avoid conflict, due to proximity of adverse weather.. Pilots may be unwilling to descend due to proximity of adverse weather area.. Pilots may be unwilling to increase speed due to turbulence (which usually exists in or near Cbs). They may also reduce speed without informing the controller. Therefore, the availability speed control as a controller tool may be limited.. Pilots setting a heading or altitude not expected by the controller.. Pilots changing the assigned heading after clearing weather (CB) without informing ATC. In general pilots request deviation from the planned route due to CBs but sometimes, when clear of weather, they turn back to their planned route without prior notification to ATC.. Increased communications with pilots.. Increased communications with adjacent ATC units to coordinate avoiding actions.. Some flights may not be able to follow missed approach procedure due to thunderstorm areas near the airport (APP/TWR environment). Some flights may initiate a go around on final due to severe turbulence, wind shear, or a flooded runway (APP/TWR environment).. More requests to use a different runway for departure or arrival due to sudden changes of wind components in combination with wet runway and radar derived information on adverse weather on the climb out route (APP/TWR environment).. Increased controllers’ and pilots’ workload.. Reduced sector capacity - The complexity of the traffic situation (traffic demand, non-standard routings, potential conflicts) may necessitate the implementation of flow measures in order to ensure safe ATC service provision during periods of massive adverse weather avoidance..
