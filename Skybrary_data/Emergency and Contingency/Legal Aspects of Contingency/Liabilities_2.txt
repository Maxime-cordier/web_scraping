not exist in the Single European Sky (SES) legislation but both in view of the role attributed to States by the Chicago Convention and the potential impact on domestic ANS, it appears preferable that the State of the aiding ANSP be also at least informed (it should be noted that all ANSPs have to notify their (NSAs) of their agreements). Either the States arrange these issues between themselves and respectively delegate the detailed development of the plans to their ANSPs, or the ANSPs conclude a contingency plan/agreement between themselves that is submitted by each of them to their respective State for approval. It would be useful that the States - or their NSA(s) - also agree on the mechanisms for coordination between them, for instance with regard to the common definition of requirements, the joint oversight by the Functional Airspace Blocks (FAB) NSA(s) and the approval of the contingency plans. Furthermore, as recommended by Annex 11 to the Chicago Convention, the States may have to ensure formal coordination with those neighbouring States which might be significantly affected in case of contingency. Any contingency plan developed by the ANSPs operating in the FAB should have to be a joint/coordinated plan, also agreed upon through a written agreement, and will need to be prepared before the start of operations of the FAB.
