The provision of family assistance requires the commitment of resources in different sectors and, consequently, the organization of specific activities aimed at meeting the following needs: Information about the event: location of the accident, list of passengers boarded, survivors, etc.;. Information about the emergency response to the rescue service accident, such as health care providers and firefighters;. Call centre organized by airlines in order to receive inquiries from families;. Dedicated safe places where victims and their families can be housed, as well as cared for at the airport and family assistance centre provided by the airline;. Coordination of travel and stays in a family assistance centre, as well as assistance to those who do not travel;. Information on the location and status of victims, recovery, identification and disposal of remains;. Information regarding the recovery, management and return of personal effects;. Social, emotional and psychological support;. Information on the progress of the investigation and its objective, possibly in all languages spoken by victims and their families;. Coordination of visits to the crash site, where access is feasible; and. Support for immediate financial needs, in accordance with Article 21 of the Montreal Convention. Another important mean of support for later stages, is to help and encourage the creation of a monument or place in honor and remembrance of the victims. As a plane crash also has a strong emotional impact on all people involved in assistance, a portion of the family assistance plan should be devoted to the specific training of staff committed to this task, in order to strengthen the resilience of operators. The family care plan should be evaluated and reviewed with the help of local organisations and operators (i.e., civil protection, rescue services, hospitals, etc.).
