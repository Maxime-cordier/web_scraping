The potential for survival of an emergency which results in a ditching depends largely on the type and effectiveness of training the flight crew and the cabin crew had received beforehand. Adequate training is required to ensure that personnel respond appropriately to the emergency and to maximize the likelihood of a successful ditching, evacuation and subsequent survival. Evacuations can be categorized as one of two main types: Planned: Those for which sufficient time exists to brief the passengers and crew and prepare the cabin. Unplanned: Those for which there is insufficient time to brief the passengers and crew.
