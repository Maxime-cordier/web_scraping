Editor's Notes <references> ^ Life jackets/vests are used for floatation in a ditching situation. They can be found in proximity to, usually under, each cabin seat. Passengers' life jackets are normally yellow in color and a different color (normally red) for the crew. Life Jackets contain one, or more often two, buoyancy chambers that can be inflated by either CO2 cartridge(s) or by oral inflation. A water activated light and a whistle are incorporated for the purpose of attracting rescuers' attention..
