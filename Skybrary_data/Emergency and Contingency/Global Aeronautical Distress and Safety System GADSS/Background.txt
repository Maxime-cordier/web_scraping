Limitations in the current air navigation system, which have hampered the timely identification and localisation of aircraft in distress, have been highlighted by tragedies such as the losses of Air France 447 and Malaysia Airlines 370. These limitations significantly hindered both effective search and rescue efforts and the recovery operations. International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has identified that the current effectiveness of alerting search and rescue services could be enhanced by developing and implementing the Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS).
