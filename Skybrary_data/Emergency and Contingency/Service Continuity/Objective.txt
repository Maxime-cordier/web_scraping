The Service Continuity stage considers those actions that will facilitate a move towards longer term contingency operations. This includes issues related to the relocation of staff, where appropriate, and the deployment of fallback systems. It also aims to support the optimisation of service provision in contingency conditions such that capacity can be increased gradually to the levels agreed previously with end users and States authorities.
