Contingency policy sets out the organisation's attitude towards contingency and states the overall contingency goals and objectives. It should be explicit about the scope of contingency within the organisation, e.g. whether it wishes to include the provision of service continuity or limit provision to 'fail to safe' modes of operation. Service continuity is a key phase within the overall generic contingency lifecycle. The planning processes involved in preparing for potential contingencies are illustrated in the following image. This shows how initial inventories and risk assessments inform the decision to invest in service continuity. It also shows how service continuity ultimately leads into recovery operations for the return to normal service. Service Continuity Planning Considerations Within the development of service continuity plans, it is possible to identify a number of other considerations. Identification of a range of potential service continuity strategies;. Hazard and risk assessment to filter the ‘realistic events'.. Mutual aid provided by or to other organisations (e.g. Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC) and neighbouring air navigation service providers (ANSPs).. Economic assessment to ascertain if there is a business case supporting the development of these strategies.. After determining “Service Continuity” contingency strategy(ies), ANSPs have to develop appropriate actions/responses. The development of “Service Continuity” plans should be made in compliance with the ESARRs (ESARR4, ESARR5 and ESARR6). The following diagram providers an overview of these more detailed aspects of service continuity planning.
