An important phase of any airport emergency is the action taken after the response to the incident. The airport emergency plan (AEP) describes those activities related to investigation and recovery. During the recovery phase, certain actions - for example, documentation, facility inspection, employee crisis psychotherapy, reconstruction, public information and general cleanup - are taken to ensure that the airport is restored to pre-emergency conditions. Airport management is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate actions are taken, regardless of the type of emergency, to re-establish safe airport operations after an incident.
