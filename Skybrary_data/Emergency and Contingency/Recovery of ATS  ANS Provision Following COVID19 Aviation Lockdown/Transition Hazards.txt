To support the risk assessment part of the Safety Argument a generic hazard identification of the ATM/ANS provision during the recovery period has been carried out. The output has been captured in a list of generic hazards that may occur during the extended period of transition to normal operations due to various factors related to the COVID-19 aviation lockdown. The potential hazards are not defined at one particular level or boundary of the ATM system. The hazards are rather potential safety issues that are not necessarily independent of each other. Some of the items in the list can also be considered as disruptors that could affect higher level operational hazards. The hazard list contains the hazard description, the list of COVID-19 lockdown related causal and contributory factors and disruptors, and possible measures to mitigate the probability of hazard occurrence or their safety effects. It is not an exhaustive list, but reflects what is known or anticipated at the time of publication. When used at local level, the list of hazards and potential mitigation measures should be reviewed and updated according to the local operational environment and the specific impact of the lockdown on the ANSPâ€™s functional system. The hazards can be assigned to the following domains: Demand-capacity balancing;. Staff skills, training and human factors;. Equipment and infrastructure;. Aeronautical information management;. Runway operations;. Aircraft navigation/flight operation;. Air ground-communication.. The importance of identification, monitoring and mitigation of risk factors associated with the rapid increase of travel demand was reinforced by the EASA SIB 2023-05 (see Furhter Reading below).
