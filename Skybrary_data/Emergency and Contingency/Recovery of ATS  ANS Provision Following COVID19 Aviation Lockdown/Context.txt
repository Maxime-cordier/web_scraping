The business continuity measures taken by ANSPs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in the scope of current and planned activities related to the provision of ATM/ANS. Most, if not all ATS units in Europe and elsewhere are operating in a very limited configuration (a few ATC sectors only) due to the significant decrease in traffic demand. The duty hours of the operational and engineering staff have been reduced respectively. Staff training and equipment maintenance plans might not have been followed due to the introduced physical distancing rules. Some facilities could have been put in ‘sleep’ mode due to absence of operational need and/or of staff to use them. Since mid-April 2020 the European Network Manager (NM) and all operational stakeholders have been working together to ensure a safe, smooth and coordinated recovery of the European ATM network operations from the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 restrictions to flying. The vehicle of this collaborative effort is provided by the European NOP 2020 Recovery plan. Within the scope of this work, the NM has developed in cooperation with the members of the EUROCONTROL Safety Team and SAFOPS group a safety argument and a list of potential safety hazards to assist ANSPs in the planning and execution of a safe return to normal operations. The safety argument and the associated hazard list will be maintained and updated based on the feedback from the operational stakeholders (ANSPs, aerodrome operators, aircraft operators) on a weekly basis.
