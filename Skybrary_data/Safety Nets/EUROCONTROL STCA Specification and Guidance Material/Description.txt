STCA (Short Term Conflict Alert) assists the controller in preventing collision between aircraft by generating, in a timely manner, an alert of a potential or actual infringement of Separation Standards (separation minima). Since 1998, EUROCONTROL has produced safety net guidelines to support the implementation of safety nets in the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) area. These specify the minimum requirements and provide guidance for the definition, implementation, optimisation and operation of ground-based safety nets. This article provides references to EUROCONTROL STCA Specification and Guidance Material. Links to the articles about the other safety nets can be found at the bottom of this page. EUROCONTROL STCA Specification and Guidance Material has been developed over the years by the safety nets community based on the accumulated practical experience.
