Generally, two types of safety barriers exist – prevention barriers and mitigation barriers. The former are used to minimize the risk of an occurrence happening and the latter are intended to eliminate or reduce the impact of an event after it has happened. There are no specific prevention barriers to address transponder failure since this is usually an equipment failure. This means that the general maintenance rules and procedures apply (as with any other piece of equipment). Therefore, this article focuses on the mitigation barriers, which are divided into “repairable” and “other” categories based on the barrier’s ability to be restored (after being breached), e.g. by a procedure. Furthermore, the mitigation barriers (as well as all safety barriers in general) are divided into several stages each of which is intended to activate if the previous have failed: Design and strategic planning – includes strategic level barriers, e.g. airspace design;. Demand and capacity balancing – focuses on ensuring sustainable workload levels;. Traffic planning and synchronisation – includes long and medium term tools and procedures for conflict detection and resolution (e.g. MTCD);. Tactical conflict management – includes various tools and procedures used for ensuring separation by timely conflict detection and resolution;. ATC collision avoidance – includes tools and procedures for collision avoidance used by air traffic controllers (e.g. STCA);. Crew collision avoidance – includes tools and procedures used by the pilots for collision avoidance (e.g. TCAS, see and avoid, etc.)..
