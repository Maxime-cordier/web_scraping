Area Proximity Warning (APW) warns the controller about unauthorised penetration of an airspace volume by generating, in a timely manner, an alert of a potential or actual infringement of the required spacing to that airspace volume. Since 1998, EUROCONTROL has produced safety net guidelines to support the implementation of safety nets in the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) area. These specify the minimum requirements and provide guidance for the definition, implementation, optimization and operation of ground-based safety nets. This article provides references to EUROCONTROL Area Proximity Warning Specification and Guidance Material. Links to the articles about the other safety nets can be found at the bottom of this page. EUROCONTROL APW Specification and Guidance Material has been developed over the years by the safety nets community based on the accumulated practical experience.
