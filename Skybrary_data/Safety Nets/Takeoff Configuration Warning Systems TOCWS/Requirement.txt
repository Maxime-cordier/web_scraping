Since the late 1970's regulations have required that a Takeoff Configuration Warning System be fitted in all jet aircraft and in non-jet aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight exceeding 6000 pounds (2725 kg) unless it can be demonstrated that a lift device or trim device that affects the takeoff performance would not compromise safety when selected to other than an approved takeoff position. The takeoff warning system is intended to serve as "back-up" for the normal checklist, particularly in unusual situations where the checklist has been interrupted or the takeoff delayed. A takeoff warning system must meet the following requirements: The system must provide the pilots with an aural warning that is automatically activated during the initial portion of the takeoff run if the airplane is in a configuration that would not allow a safe takeoff. When considering a TOCWS, an unsafe takeoff configuration is the inability to rotate or the inability to prevent an immediate stall after rotation. The means used to activate the system must function properly for all authorized takeoff power settings and procedures and throughout the ranges of takeoff weights, altitudes, and temperatures for which the aircraft is certified. The warning must continue until: The configuration is changed to allow safe takeoff, or. Action is taken by the pilot to abandon the takeoff roll.
