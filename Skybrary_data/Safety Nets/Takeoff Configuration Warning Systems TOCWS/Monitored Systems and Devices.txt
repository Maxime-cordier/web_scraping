The aircraft systems which are monitored and can produce a takeoff configuration warning vary by aircraft type and level of sophistication. In virtually all cases, these include: Position of High Lift Devices such as flaps and slats. Elevator trim position or trimable horizontal stabiliser position as appropriate. Position of ground spoilers or speedbrakes. Additional systems that may be monitored, and cause a takeoff configuration warning to be generated, on some aircraft types include: Rudder trim position. Aileron trim position. Parking brake engagement. Mismatched aircraft configuration and Flight Management System entries such as flap setting and FLEX temperature.
