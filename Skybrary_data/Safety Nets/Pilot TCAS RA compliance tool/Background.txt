The development and implementation of the Traffic alert and Collison Avoidance System (TCAS) was driven by the objective to prevent aviation accidents. When there is a risk of collision, TCAS will issue a Resolution Advisory (RA) telling pilots how to change the vertical rate of the aircraft to avoid a collision, so a prompt and accurate pilot response to all RAs is particularly important. Late or incorrect responses may degrade safety. TCAS RA not followed by the pilot has been identified as one of the Top 5 Operational Safety Hazards in Europe by the Network Manager (EUROCONTROL) within the scope of their annual operational risk identification and monitoring process.
