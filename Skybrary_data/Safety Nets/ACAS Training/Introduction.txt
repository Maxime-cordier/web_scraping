The Airborne Collision Avoidance System II (ACAS II) was introduced in order to reduce the risk of mid-air collisions or near mid-air collisions between aircraft. It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any separation standards. Flight crews and controllers must have a clear understanding of ACAS II requirements and operating procedures, so ACAS II safety benefits can be realised. That understanding is achieved through initial and recurrent training.
