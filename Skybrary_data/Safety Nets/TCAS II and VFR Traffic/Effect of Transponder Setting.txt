The effect of different transponder settings on TCAS II operation is illustrated on the table below: Transponder Setting: Effect: Protection: OFF or SBY. Intruder not detected. No protection. ON. TA without altitude. Assists visual contact. ALT. TA/RA. Full TCAS Protection. To obtain maximum protection, transponders should always be switched 'ON' with 'ALT' set, unless other instructions are issued by the controller. This applies outside controlled airspace as well as inside. Within controlled airspace, the controller will provide the code to be set; outside controlled airspace, code 2000 should be set except where another general code is promulgated or a specific code is issued by ATC.
