To prevent incorrect pilot responses, in version 7.0 the “Adjust vertical speed, adjust” RAs has been replaced by a new “Level off, level off” RA which requires a reduction of vertical rate to 0 ft/min. The level off is to be achieved promptly, not at the next standard flight level (e.g. FL200, FL210, etc.). The “Level off, level off” RA may be issued as an initial RA or as a weakening RA when the vertical distance between the aircraft increases. Additionally, the “Level off, level off” RA will minimise the altitude deviations induced by TCAS (level busts while “flying the green arc”), thus reducing the impact on ATC operations.
