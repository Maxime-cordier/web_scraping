Since its introduction in Europe in 2000, TCAS II version 7.0 has been the subject of monitoring. In the course of analysing recorded and reported events, many cases were found in which pilots did not respond correctly to the “Adjust vertical speed, adjust” Resolution Advisories (RAs) – the vertical rate was increased rather than reduced. Additionally, there have also been a number of cases in which TCAS II version 7.0 failed to reverse an RA when two converging aircraft remained within 100 feet. This type scenario would be occur when one aircraft is not following the RA or is not TCAS II equipped and follows an ATC instruction or performs an avoidance manoeuvre based on visual acquisition.
