The development of TCAS II version 7.1 was initiated by EUROCONTROL following the discovery of two safety issues with the current TCAS II version. Development was undertaken jointly by the RTCA (Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics) in the United States and by European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) (European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment) in Europe with support and contributions from several other organizations, including major airlines and air navigation service providers (ANSPs). During a joint session in March 2008, the RTCA SC (Special Committee) 147 and EUROCAE WG (Working Group) 75 agreed on the final version of the TCAS II MOPS, to be known as TCAS II version 7.1. The MOPS were approved the RTCA Program Management Committee in June 2008 (document DO-185B) and by the EUROCAE Council in September 2008 (document ED-143). The MOPS were revised following the identification by EUROCONTROL of two safety issues in the existing TCAS logic (one relating to the performance of the RA-reversal logic, and the other involving incorrect responses to Adjust Vertical Speed RAs). Currently, TCAS II version 7.1 is mandated in European airspace (other TCAS II version fall outside the mandate).
