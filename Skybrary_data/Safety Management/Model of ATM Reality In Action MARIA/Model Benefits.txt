MARIA is a knowledge database and an automation framework providing a global view of the ATM system, covering the high level, abstract functions, and their decomposition to the systemâ€™s building blocks (components) and their interactions. It is an answer to the need for a better knowledge and understanding of current ATM systems, and a basis for safety assessments being done at system level. MARIA is independent from the underlying technology or implementation as it only covers the functions and the information flows. It helps harmonization of the designation of functions which will facilitate the communication between ATM stakeholders. The current version of the MARIA is starting to be used for safety analysis and impact assessment. The impact of equipment failure can be derived from the model in terms of the functions directly and indirectly impaired. This information can be used to adapt the monitoring indicators. The model describes both the system functions and the architecture with all its mechanisms. From this base the specific architecture of an ATS unit can be automatically obtained. The use of MARIA for hazard identification has been validated by means of a trial FHA session at Lisbon ACC. It is now systematically used in the FHA done for the ATC units of the Lisbon FIR.
