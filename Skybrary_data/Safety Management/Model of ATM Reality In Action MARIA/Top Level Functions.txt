The top level functions are represented in the following figure. Each of the system functions is described and further decomposed. An additional function to maintain the infrastructure, which includes the provision of resources, was derived. A fictitious function designated as “Exterior” was added to cover the data exchange with external systems/functions. The description of the system functions does not cover the mechanisms that perform the function. This is only included in the description of the system architecture which is ANSP specific. The information gathered from the interviews describes mainly the human functions and all the inputs required from the technical support function. To ensure the consistency of MARIA, namely that all flows have a start and an end, each function and each data flow are assigned a unique identifier thus enabling referencing and automatic checking. The functions are decomposed until a specific enabler is identified. The human functions are decomposed to a level where specific training or rating requirements are specified. Technical functions are decomposed up to the level where the mechanism is identified – the set of related equipment used to provide a specific function. The top-down functions’ decomposition has been validated by a bottom-up matching of the existing equipment. The Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT) was used to represent the top level functions and the associated inputs and outputs. Details of some of the functions were captured using Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN), a much richer notation which permits recording the way work is done. The following diagram illustrates the description of the sub-function ‘Conflict resolution’.
