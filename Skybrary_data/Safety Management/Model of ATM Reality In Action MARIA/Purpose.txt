MARIA is neither a business, nor a safety model. It is built to allow several perspectives of analysis depending on the aim at hand. It may be used in simulations to identify strong and weak points, to evaluate risk mitigation strategies and for other purposes. The following goals were defined at the start of model development: provide a global view of the system (people, procedures and equipment);. show the dependencies between functions / processes;. build a description of the system architecture;. provide the reference for future safety assessments;. come up with a systematic and reproducible hazard identification method;. help the definition of risk mitigation strategies..
