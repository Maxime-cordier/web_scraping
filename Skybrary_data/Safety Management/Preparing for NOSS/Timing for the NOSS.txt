Consideration must also be given to where the project fits in with other ongoing activities and developments in the ATS organisation. If new equipment has been commissioned, or major changes in procedures are being implemented, that is probably not a good time to conduct a NOSS. On the other hand, if a period is foreseen in which there will be a relative surplus of staff available, this might be an excellent opportunity to schedule the data collection phase of a NOSS. No all-encompassing guidelines are available for deciding on the time frame, except that the NOSS project steering committee would seem to be the logical platform for this discussion.
