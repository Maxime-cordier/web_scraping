Briefings provide both an ideal opportunity to explain the NOSS concept and a forum to identify unforeseen issues and answer questions. Each briefing should be carefully planned to ensure a logical flow of information that focuses on the needs and requirements of each particular group. At each briefing ample time should be allowed for questions and discussion on key issues. The content of each briefing needs to be tailored to each group's needs; however, there are a number of generic items that should be included in all briefings: the purpose of the NOSS and the intended outcomes;. where the NOSS process fits into the organisation's Safety Management System;. the extent of the planned NOSS including the locations to be observed and the timeframe for the NOSS;. an explanation of the NOSS operating characteristics; and. the name and contact details of the project manager for any queries or issues that may arise in relation to the planned NOSS.. According to ICAO there are several groups whose support is critical for the NOSS that should receive specific and tailored briefings. These groups are: senior management, staff representatives/unions groups, operational managers; supervisors, general staff. Correctly managed briefings that promote this philosophy will greatly improve the likelihood of a successful NOSS. Preparation and planning are the keys to success in this area and if correctly executed will result in an informed organisation that is prepared and willing to participate.
