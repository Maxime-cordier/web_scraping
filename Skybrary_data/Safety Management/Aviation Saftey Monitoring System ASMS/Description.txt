Aviation Saftey Monitoring System (ASMS) is a relational database that links information on aviation document holders with safety failures (occurrences and non-compliances) and tracks corrective actions. It is fully integrated with CAAâ€™s management information system and contains tools for creating and maintaining a database, customising and creating occurrence reports, tracking safety investigations, analysing data, and tracking corrective actions. Risk management is facilitated though the use of severity and likelihood codes. Automated Occurrence Report forms provide assistance in entering data and provide an audit trail of changes made. Investigation reports support full multimedia, including pictures.
