Across the ATM industry, ANSPs are at different level of SMS development and implementation. Some service providers have very mature systems, which are fully integrated into the operations; others are still in the early stages of SMS implementation. This diversity can be attributed to the existing differences in national regulatory frameworks, (un)availability of resources at local level and considerable variation in style and content of the used implementation guidance material. A typical SMS of an air navigation service provider comprises a system of organisational arrangements, processes, procedures and practices that includes the following components: Safety Policy. Safety Accountabilities and Responsibilities. SMS Organisational Structure, including a Safety Manager. Safety planning, in terms of established safety performance targets and SMS enhancement plan,. Safety reporting and investigation. Safety performance monitoring and measurement. Safety Surveys. Safety Documentation, including safety standards and procedures. Competency. Risk Management, including hazard identification, risk assessment and mitigation. Safety interfaces. Continuous (safety) improvement. Safety promotion and lesson dissemination.
