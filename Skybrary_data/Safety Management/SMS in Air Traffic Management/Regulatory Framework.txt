The implementation of SMS in ATM industry was facilitated by changes to the regulatory frameworks. According to ICAO Annex 11 - Air Traffic Services, “States shall require, as part of their safety programme, that an air traffic services provider implements a safety management system acceptable to the State that, as a minimum: a) identifies safety hazards; b) ensures that remedial action necessary to maintain an acceptable level of safety is implemented; c) provides for continuous monitoring and regular assessment of the safety level achieved; and d) aims to make continuous improvement to the overall level of safety.” The EUROCONTROL ESARR 3 - Use of Safety Management Systems by ATM Service Providers extends the SMS scope to include airspace management and air traffic flow management, in addition to air traffic services. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) “ATO Safety Management System Manual" establishes that the SMS shall address all aspects of ATC and navigation services, including (but not limited to) airspace changes, air traffic procedures and standards, airport procedures and standards, new and modified equipment (hardware and software), and associated human interactions. According to Regulation 1035/2011 - Common Requirements for the Provision of Air Navigation Services, “An air navigation service provider shall manage the safety of all its services. In doing so, it shall establish formal interfaces with all stakeholders which may influence directly the safety of its services.” See Further Reading.
