The primary purpose of Mandatory Occurrence Reporting Scheme (MORS) is to secure free and uninhibited reporting, and dissemination of the substance of the reports, where necessary, in the interest of flight safety. It covers operators, manufacturers, maintenance, repair and overhaul, air traffic control services, and aerodrome operators. Only certain kinds of incidents, namely, those that are “endangering” or “potentially endangering,” are subject to mandatory reporting; others are not. Reporting of “day-to-day defects/incidents, etc” is discouraged. These are left to the CAA’s Occurrence Reporting Scheme. Mandatory Occurrence Reporting Scheme (MORS) was established by the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) following a fatal accident in 1972.
