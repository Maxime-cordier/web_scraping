IOSA was established in 2003 to meet airline industry needs for common globally-harmonised operating safety standards. Prior to implementation of IOSA, airlines audited one another on their ability to deliver safe operation. The audits had varying standards with no consistency. Implementation of IOSA has led to airlines from all regions having incorporated IOSA Standards into their airline operations. IOSA is a major component of industry efforts to improve aviation safety, and is now recognised globally as the benchmark safety audit programme. IOSA is not intended as a substitute for state regulatory authority oversight. However, IOSA audit reports can provide valuable additional data that can assist States in risk assessment and in planning their own inspections. A growing number of governments are planning to incorporate IOSA as part of their certification process. The IOSA programme is subject to oversight by the IOSA Oversight Committee (IOC) - an entity within the IATA governance structure established to ensure that: The IOSA programme team uses processes compliant with recognised quality standards;. The IATA member airlines play an active role in the IOSA programme;. The IOC roster is representative of the global industry.. The IOC is comprised of representatives from twenty-five member airlines and ten regulatory authorities. The IOC reports to the Operations Committee, which in turn, reports to the IATA Board of Governors.
