Airlines that have undergone an IOSA audit by an IATA accredited audit organisation and have cleared all findings, enter the IOSA registry. The IOSA registry is a listing of all IOSA registered operators and is updated on a continuous basis. IOSA registration is a confirmation of the commitment of an airline to deliver a safe operation based on the standards contained in the IOSA standards manual. It is important to note that IOSA is an audit of an airlineâ€™s operational procedures and documentation - it is not a physical inspection of aircraft. To maintain their status on the IOSA registry, airlines must undergo, and complete, an IOSA audit every two years.
