In the context of providing support to air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to enhance the effectiveness of their SMSs, amongst a variety of programmes and initiatives, a series of Safety Team ‘Best’ practice pamphlets is being produced to share accumulated and hard won safety experience and knowledge. The pamphlets rely wholly on the input of ANSPs who provide the raw materials that are developed with EUROCONTROL to produce ‘best’ practice advice to other ANSPs so that they can learn from the experience of others and enhance their own SMSs and operational safety.
