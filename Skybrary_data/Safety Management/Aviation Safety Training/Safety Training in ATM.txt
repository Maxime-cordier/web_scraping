In air traffic management (ATM), training in ATM safety is a more limited market, but nevertheless still growing at a significant rate. In ATM safety management, courses are provided: at a general level, providing awareness of safety concepts and management systems, as well as. on a wide range of specific safety management topics, including the application of safety assessment methodologies, development of safety cases and safety occurrence investigation.. In ATM safety regulation also, a range of courses is offered by EUROCONTROL to address specific aspects of safety oversight, including application of the current European-level requirements for ATM safety, and the application of audit techniques to safety regulation. Most recently, it has been found essential to further enhance this training programme, and a formal training curriculum has now been launched to provide a complete training package for National Supervisory Authority (NSA) personnel. The NSA Training Initiative will provide formal safety education for National Supervisory Authority personnel from ab-initio level to fully trained regulator.
