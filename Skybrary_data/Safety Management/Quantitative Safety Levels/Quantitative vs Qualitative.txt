In case the acceptable level of safety cannot be presented in quantitative terms, the decisions often rely on operational judgment, i.e. qualitative arguments are used. The combination of both sorts of arguments - the quantitative (absolute values, mathematical models, statistical analysis etc.) and the qualitative (e.g. work experience, professional judgement etc.) can be used to provide a solid level of assurance that all identified safety objectives and requirements are met. ICAO Doc. 4444 (PANS ATM) contains a note on safety assessment of changes, which advises that in case, where “… due to the nature of the change, the acceptable level of safety cannot be expressed in quantitative terms, the safety assessments may rely on operational judgment.”
