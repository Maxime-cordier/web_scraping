Setting up quantitative expressions for the safety performance targets enables the organisation to better measure and monitor the achieved levels of safety. The usage of reliable quantitative data will also provide a sound basis for management decision making. The desired safety outcome (target) may be presented either in absolute or relative terms. It is common practice to use mathematical models for the definition of quantitative safety performance targets, for example to define (estimate) a target rate of safety occurrences of a given severity. However, it is impossible or impractical to quantify some factors. Based on quantitative risk assessment, EUROCONTROL has established in ESARR 4 an overall safety performance target for ATM in the ECAC region - the maximum tolerable probability of ATM directly contributing to an accident of a commercial air transport aircraft shall not be greater than 1.55 x 10 -8 per flight hour. This overall safety performance target is used by ECAC states and air navigation service providers in the definition of the national and the service providerâ€™s safety performance targets.
