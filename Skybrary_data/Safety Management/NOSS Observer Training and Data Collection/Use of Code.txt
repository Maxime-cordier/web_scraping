In the worksheets the observers assign codes to the threats, errors and undesired states they record. According ICAO NOSS manual, these codes are to be provided in the code books together with the worksheets. The NOSS code books are living documents, i.e. new items and codes are added to the existing lists as more NOSS experience is gained over time. Codes for threats exist at three different levels. The observers use the “event description” code, which is the lowest level available. Once the analyst starts entering the codes from multiple observations in a database, the grouping into “threat types” and “threat categories” will become apparent. These are respectively the middle and highest level of codes available. Based on the feedback from the observers, the NOSS facilitator and analyst may have to assign new “event description” codes for threats, errors and/or undesired states that are unique to a particular ATC facility. The integrity of the NOSS coding is preserved by adhering to the main types and categories when assigning new codes.
