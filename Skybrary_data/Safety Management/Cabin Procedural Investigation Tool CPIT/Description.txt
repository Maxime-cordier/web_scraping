The Cabin Procedural Investigation Tool (CPIT) process focuses on a cognitive approach to understand how and why the event occurred, not who was responsible. Cabin Procedural Investigation Tool (CPIT) depends on an investigative philosophy, which acknowledges that professional cabin crews very rarely fail to comply with a procedure intentionally, especially if it is likely to result in an increased safety risk. It also requires the airline to explicitly adopt a non-jeopardy approach to incident investigation. Cabin Procedural Investigation Tool (CPIT) contains more than 100 analysis elements that enable the user to conduct an in-depth investigation, summarise findings and integrate them across various events. The Cabin Procedural Investigation Tool (CPIT) data organisation enables operators to track their progress in addressing the issues revealed by the analyses. Cabin Procedural Investigation Tool (CPIT) is made up of two components: the interview process and contributing analysis. It provides an indepth structured analytic process that consists of a sequence of steps that identify key contributing factors to cabin crew errors and the development of effective recommendations aimed at the elimination of similar errors in the future. The Cabin Procedural Investigation Tool (CPIT) approach, developed by Boeing, has benefited from lessons learned by its sister program, Procedural Event Analysis Tool (PEAT), which Boeing has provided to airlines since 1999. Cabin Procedural Investigation Tool (CPIT) is a stand-alone service, but is normally offered with PEAT training.
