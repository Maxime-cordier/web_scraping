GSIP is a worldwide initiative that guides the aviation community’s identification and response to challenges that may emerge from an organization’s safety data collection and processing system (SDCPS). The four SDCPS focus areas include safety data collection, safety data analytics, safety information protection, and safety information sharing. GSIP is led by the Flight Safety Foundation with engagement from public and private sector contributors from each of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) geographic regions. GSIP was initiated in 2015 by a cooperative agreement between the Flight Safety Foundation and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
