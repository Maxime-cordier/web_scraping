Between 2015 and 2017, over 25 focus group sessions, workshops and conferences were conducted with global aviation stakeholders in 15 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific and Pan America regions. To further expand the global reach of GSIP and connect with a broader global audience of aviation safety practitioners, a four-part webinar series was also conducted. In addition to the qualitative inputs provided by GSIP participants, multiple surveys were administered to gather quantitative data to understand the current state of global SDCPSs and current safety risk management practices.
