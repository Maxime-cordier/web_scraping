A provision in Regulation (EU) no 376/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the reporting, analysis and follow-up of occurrences in civil aviation sets a requirement for reporting occurrences at European Community level. The objective of this requirement is to introduce further improvement of the safety of civil aviation by better understanding of these occurrences and to facilitate analysis and trend monitoring in order to initiate corrective action. According to the Regulation, when an occurrence involves aircraft registered in a Member State or operated by an undertaking established in a Member State, this occurrence should be reported even if it happened outside the territory of the European Community. Aviation operators and service provider organisations of the Member States, through their mandatory reporting systems, are required to report to the competent authorities the occurrences presented in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2018.
