The ICAO requirements laid down in several Annexes to the Chicago Convention, relating to the implementation of safety management systems (SMS), require that aviation service providers develop and maintain, within the scope of their SMS, a formal process for collecting, recording, acting on and generating feedback about hazards in operations. The process shall be based on a combination of reactive, proactive and predictive methods of safety data collection. More detailed requirements and guidance on safety occurrence reporting are contained in Annex 13 - Aircraft accident and incident investigation and Doc 9859 - Safety Management Manual.
