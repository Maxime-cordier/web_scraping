It is important to establish clearly the relationship between the various reporting requirements set by international organisations and state regulators. ICAO Annex 13 puts requirements on States to establish and operate a mandatory incident reporting system to collect information about actual or potential safety hazards. In addition, States are encouraged to implement a voluntary incident reporting system to facilitate the collection of information that could not be captured by the mandatory incident reporting system. States should support incident reporting by creating a non-punitive environment through appropriate adjustments in their legislative and regulatory frameworks. Mandatory occurrence reporting requirements for aviation service providers and operating personal are set by the State regulatory and investigation authorities in compliance with ICAO provisions. Such national regulatory reporting requirements and related means of compliance may vary widely throughout the States. Safety occurrence reporting in Europe is also regulated by EASA requirements and EU directives. For example, EU-OPS recommends that "An operator shall establish procedures for reporting accidents and serious incidents..." [1] Furthermore, the operator must report the occurrence as quickly as possible, to the National Authority in the State of operatorâ€™s registration and to the Authority in the State where the occurrence took place. The report must be made within 72 hours of the occurrence and in case of an accident - before the aircraft is moved. The State of Occurrence of an accident or serious incident shall forward the notification with a minimum delay to the State of Registry, the State of the Operator, the State of Design, the State of Manufacture and ICAO. The notification shall be in plain language and contain as much details as readily available.
