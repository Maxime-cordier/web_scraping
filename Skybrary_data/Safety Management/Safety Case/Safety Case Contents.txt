A good Safety Case should include, at least: What the Safety Case is trying to demonstrate - this should be directly related to the Claim that the subject of the Safety Case is acceptably safe;. Why is the Safety Case being written and for whom;. A description of the system/change and its operational/physical environment, sufficient only to explain what the Safety Case addresses and for the reader to understand the remainder of the Safety Case;. For PSC, the justification for introducing the change (and therefore potentially for incurring some risk);. A reasoned and well-structured Safety Argument, showing how the Aim is satisfied;. Supporting safety evidence to substantiate the Safety Argument;. All assumptions, outstanding safety issues, and any limitations or restrictions on the operation of the system;. A simple statement to the effect that the Aim has been satisfied, subject to the stated caveats..
