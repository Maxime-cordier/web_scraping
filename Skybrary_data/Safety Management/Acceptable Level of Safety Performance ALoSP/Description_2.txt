of rate instead of absolute numbers. Subsequently (at a mature ALoSP stage), lower-consequence safety indicators may be developed. Once a Stateâ€™s ALoSP package has been defined, it is possible to compile a summary of the performance outcomes of each safety indicator on a regular basis. The target and alert level for each indicator may then be checked for their respective performance (achievement) status. A consolidated summary of the overall performance outcome may then be compiled for a particular period. To ensure that the ALoSP safety indicators remain effective and appropriate over time, they need to be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary. Note: The establishment of ALoSP safety indicators, targets and alerts does not replace or supersede the need for States to implement all applicable SARPs.
