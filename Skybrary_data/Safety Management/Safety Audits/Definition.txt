Safety auditing is a core safety management activity, providing a means of identifying potential problems before they have an impact on safety. Safety regulatory audit means a systematic and independent examination conducted by, or on behalf of, a national supervisory authority to determine whether complete safety-related arrangements or elements thereof, related to processes and their results, products or services, comply with required safety-related arrangements and whether they are implemented effectively and are suitable to achieve expected results (Regulation (EU) No 1034/2011 on safety oversight in ATM and ANS)
