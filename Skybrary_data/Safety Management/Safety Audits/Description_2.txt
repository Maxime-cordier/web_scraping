the performance and the general condition of the organisationâ€™s SMS. Audits which limit observations to items of regulatory non-compliance are of limited value, because they will not encourage the audited organisation to act proactively. The audit report should be an objective presentation of the results of the safety audit. The key principles to be observed in the development of the audit report are: Consistency of observations and recommendations;. Conclusions substantiated with references;. Observations and recommendations stated clearly and concisely;. Avoidance of generalities and vague observations;. Objectivity of observations;. Avoidance of criticism of individuals or positions.. According to ICAO Doc 9859 - Safety Management Manual safety auditing is a proactive safety management activity which provides means for identifying potential problems before they have an impact on safety. Therefore, safety auditing has the characteristics attributed to both the safety assurance domain of SMS, and the hazard identification element of risk management. Safety audits may be conducted externally - by the designated State regulatory authority, internally - by the aviation services provider organisation, or by a qualified external safety auditor, for example a consultancy agency. Regardless of the driving force behind the audit, the activities and output from both internal and external audits are similar.
