Once the data verification process has been completed, the data are ready to be entered into a database. It is recommended that a unique observation number be assigned to every observation â€” this will be the key identifier across all data sets. A number of tables and variables need to be created in the relational database so that later retrieval and data manipulation are as flexible as possible. In short, separate tables are needed for threats, errors, undesired states and for observations. In the threat table, each row is an individual threat as logged by an observer, and the columns refer to the demographics and threat management variables associated with that threat, e.g. the centre/place, time, observation number, description of the threat and how the threat was managed. The number of rows in the table is equal to the total number of threats observed during the NOSS. Similarly for errors and undesired states, separate tables will allow each row to be an individual error (or undesired state) and the columns to contain all associated information, e.g. demographics of when and where it occurred, how it was handled, if it was detected, the outcome and, of course, the observation number that is used as the identifier to link threats and errors from the same observation. The observation table differs from the other tables in that each row represents one observation. The number of rows is the total number of observations in the NOSS. As most observations contain more than one threat and more than one error, this information cannot appear on separate rows as with the other tables, but rather the data are summarized so that observation #5 is seen to have 4 threats and 3 errors for example. This table becomes useful for reporting trends across observations, e.g. how many observations had two or more threats, how many observations were error-free, and how many observations at centre X had two or more equipment threats.
