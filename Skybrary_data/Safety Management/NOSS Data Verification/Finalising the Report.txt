There are many ways to write a NOSS report. One is to start at the broad level and talk about generic findings for threats, errors and undesired states. From there, more specific findings can be highlighted at the subcategory and even individual TEM component level. Ideally, the report lays out the emerging patterns of strengths and vulnerabilities within the operation in a way that the reader can also see those patterns. From there, suggestions can be made as to targets for investigation and improvement. However, these suggestions should be offered tentatively because it is possible that other individuals in the organisation may interpret things differently or have alternative explanations for the findings. The report is best offered as an “Initial report of findings”. This way, further analyses are possible as other individuals pursue patterns and answers in the data. Care must be taken in processing and analysing the data because small mistakes can lead to large inaccuracies in the final product. It is important to double-check all work, and it is preferable if a second individual can review the analyst’s work and look for errors. These reviews need to be at both the analysis and report-writing phase as mistakes at this level could actually be detrimental to the organisation if incorrect information is presented. The analysis and report will vary depending on the type and number of working positions observed and what actually occurred in that airspace. The most important factor in ensuring a high quality report is for the analyst/report writer to be intimately familiar with both the data and the narratives in order to extract the maximum amount of information from the NOSS data. At the same time, care must be taken not to draw overly definitive conclusions if there are only limited data highlighting particular issues.
