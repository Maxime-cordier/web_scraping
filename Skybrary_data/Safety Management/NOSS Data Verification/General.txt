Data-driven programmes, such as NOSS, should employ rigorous data management techniques and quality checks. Therefore, there is a critical quality control step that occurs subsequent to data collection and prior to data analysis. This step is the “data verification” phase. The data verification phase consists of two stages and serves to assure the quality and consistency of the data, as well as to filter out subjective observations made by observers, before the data is analysed. Data verification is a labour-intensive process that may take up to a week to complete (depending on the size of the NOSS). The result is a reliable set of observation data with consistently coded threats, errors and undesired states that are ready to be analysed.
