Since the early stages of aviation, the civil aviation system was established on a set of prescriptive rules, designed to ensure safety. ICAO Annex 19 (Safety Management) introduces a new approach to managing safety, focused on safety performance and safety risks. As a consequence, States are putting in place risk-based oversight (RBO) and performance-based oversight strategies. RBO is an approach where oversight activities are prioritized based on the risk profile of the organization. Performance-based oversight, on the other hand, assesses the effectiveness of the organizationâ€™s management system (e.g., Safety Management System [SMS], Quality Management System [QMS]) in driving toward safety objectives. Therefore, the combination of compliance-based, risk-based, and performance-based oversight should all be seen as complementary approaches.
