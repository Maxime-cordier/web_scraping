Continuous improvement of the SMS thus aims at determining the immediate causes of below standard performance and their implications in the operation of the SMS, and rectifying situations involving below standard performance identified through safety assurance activities. Continuous improvement is achieved through internal evaluations, internal and external audits and applies to: Proactive evaluation of facilities, equipment, documentation and procedures, for example, through internal evaluations;. Proactive evaluation of an individual’s performance, to verify the fulfilment of that individual’s safety responsibilities, for example, through periodic competency checks;. Reactive evaluations in order to verify the effectiveness of the system for control and mitigation of safety risks, for example, through internal and external audits.. As a conclusion, continuous improvement can occur only when the organisation displays constant vigilance regarding the effectiveness of its technical operations and its corrective actions. Indeed, without ongoing monitoring of safety controls and mitigation actions, there is no way of telling whether the safety management process is achieving its objectives. Similarly, there is no way of measuring if an SMS is fulfilling its purpose with efficiency.
