There appear to be few if any published regulatory targets which define an acceptable level of safety for civil flying displays. In parallel with this, little attempt appears to have been made to compare accident rates between display flying and GA flying in the same country or to compare display accident rates between countries which have a significant number of such approved displays annually (235 appears to be a typical figure for the recent past in the UK) as a basis for monitoring regulatory effectiveness. However, the investigation into the 2015 display accident in Shoreham UK did examine available data. Over a 10 year period, the data was found to show a rate of 1.5 fatal accidents per 100,000 hours in UK GA overall but, using the assumption that the average duration of a display item is 8 minutes, that the Display fatal accident rate in the same period was 456 fatal accidents per 100,000 hours. A rough comparison between the number of Display Items per fatal display accident showed that the US figure (5600) was approaching twice the UK one (2960).
