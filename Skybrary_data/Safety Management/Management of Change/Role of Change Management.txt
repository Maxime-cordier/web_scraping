A formal change management process should identify changes within the organisation which may affect established processes, procedures, products and services. All necessary arrangements to ensure safety performance should be identified and described prior to implementing changes. The result of this process is the reduction in the safety risks resulting from changes in the provision of services by the organisation to as low as reasonably practical (ALARP) level. System description is one of the fundamental preliminary activities in the planning of an Safety Management System. The objective of the system description is to determine a baseline hazard analysis for the baseline system. As the system evolves, seemingly small, incremental changes in the system (or the environment which provides the context of operation) can accumulate over time, which will make the initial system description inaccurate. Therefore, as part of a formal process of the management of change, the system description and the baseline hazard analysis should be reviewed periodically, even if circumstances of change are not present, to determine their continued validity. When changes to the system are made, and periodically thereafter, an organisation should go over its system, its anticipated, and its actual operational environment, to make sure it continues to hold a clear picture of the circumstances under which the provision of service takes place.
