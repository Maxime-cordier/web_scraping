Aviation organisations experience permanent change due to expansion, contraction, changes to existing systems, equipment, programmes, products and services, and introduction of new equipment or procedures. Hazards may inadvertently be introduced into an operation whenever change occurs. Safety management practices require that hazards that are a by-product of change be systematically and proactively identified and appropriate measures to manage the safety risks of the consequences of hazards be identified, implemented and subsequently evaluated. A change can introduce new hazards, impact the appropriateness of existing safety risk mitigation strategies and/or impact the effectiveness of existing safety risk mitigation means. Changes may be external to the organisation, or internal. Examples of external changes include changes in regulatory requirements and reorganisation of air traffic control. Examples of internal changes include management changes, new equipment and new procedures.
