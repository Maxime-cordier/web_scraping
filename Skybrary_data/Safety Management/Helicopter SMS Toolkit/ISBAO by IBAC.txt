The International Standard for Business Aircraft Operations (IS-BAO) was formally introduced and made available to the business aviation community at the European Business Aviation Conference and Exhibit (EBACE) in Geneva, May 2002. IS-BAO was developed by the industry for the benefit of the industry. It is a code of best practices designed to help flight departments worldwide achieve a high level of safety and professionalism. At the core of the IS-BAO is a company Safety Management System (SMS). A safety-risk profile is a documented overview of the risks likely to be experienced by the flight operations of the company. The safety-risk profile is operator specific. Guidelines have been developed to assist aircraft operators to identify the hazards and categorise the risks related to their operations, develop and document mitigations, and track and measure the results of their activities. Developed by an international team of experts sponsored by the Helicopter Association International (HAI), the International Business Aviation Council (IBAC), the new European Helicopter Association (EHA) and the British Helicopter Association (BHA) (all member of the IHST and/or of the EHEST), the 2012 revision of IS-BAO also addresses helicopter operations.
