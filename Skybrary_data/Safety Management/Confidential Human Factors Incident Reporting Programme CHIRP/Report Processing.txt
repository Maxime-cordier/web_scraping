CHIRP expects to receive what may be described as ‘near miss’ incident and hazard reports that have not progressed to the stage at which they become ‘reportable occurrences and accidents’. After reports have been disidentified, CHIRP is expected to: Determine, with guidance from advisory boards that comprise practitioners experienced in the relevant disciplines, what the core issues are and who needs to be informed so that they can take corrective action;. Obtain reporters’ agreements to use their disidentified reports to compile and publish periodical newsletters so that a wider audience may read and learn from reporters’ experiences and lessons identified;. Analyse and compare reports to identify common factors and emerging trends for communication to those who are responsible for specifying procedures, training requirements, design requirements or exercising safety or security oversight..
