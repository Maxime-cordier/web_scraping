EUROCONTROL ESARR 4 Risk Assessment and Mitigation in ATM is intended to support the implementation of a systematic assessment and control of the safety impact of ATM System changes. Within the overall objective of ensuring safety, the objective of ESARR 4 is to ensure that the risks associated with hazards in the ATM System are systematically and formally identified, assessed, and managed within safety levels which, as a minimum, meet those approved by the designated regulatory authority. ESARR 4 was transposed into European Community law by Regulation 2096/2005 - Common Requirements for the Provision of Air Navigation Services and is supported by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1035/2011 of 17 October 2011 (which replaced Regulation 2096/2005).
