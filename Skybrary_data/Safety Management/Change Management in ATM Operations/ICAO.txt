ICAO Annex 11, in conjunction with ICAO Doc 9859 (Safety Management Manual), provides a common safety assurance methodology based on a SMS that allows a consistent regulatory approach and, consequently, a common framework for USOAP assessment and comparison. Safety management systems should also ensure that safety targets are defined (quantitative or qualitative), hazards are identified, remedial action planned (and taken) and that monitoring is used to verify that the safety levels are maintained. These processes aim to ensure that proposed changes to the ATM System will not jeopardise safety.
