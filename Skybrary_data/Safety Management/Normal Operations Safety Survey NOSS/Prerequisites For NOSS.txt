Before NOSS is conducted in an organisation a careful preparation for NOSS should be carried out. There has to be agreement from both the management of the organisation and the body or bodies that represent(s) the air traffic controllers. In the agreement the non-disciplinary nature of the data collection process must be emphasized. Furthermore a mechanism has to be agreed for securing the collected data and for preventing that data from being misused. It should be clear that NOSS data are not designed to be used for incident investigation or research purposes. Organisations require a process independent from NOSS for capturing safety data in the event of an incident or accident.
