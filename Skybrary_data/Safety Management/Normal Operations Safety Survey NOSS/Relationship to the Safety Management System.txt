NOSS is designed to complement existing safety data collection sources. Its added value is that it provides data from normal operations (as opposed to abnormal occurrences during operations), and it is not occurrence-driven like most of the existing mechanisms. NOSS can be scheduled at any time that is suitable for the organisation, to sample the systemic safety performance in daily operations and to provide an overview of the organisational strengths and weaknesses in the management of threats, errors and undesired states during normal operations. The organisation can subsequently act on the outcome of a NOSS before safety issues manifest themselves through occurrences. Safety data from NOSS are data that are not otherwise available. As such they complement the traditional sources of data of a safety management system. NOSS is regarded as a component of an ATC safety management system (SMS), as a safety management tool. As such NOSS is a tool that assists air traffic services providers to comply with Annex 11, 2.2.7.3 c), i.e. to “provide for continuous monitoring and regular assessment of the safety level achieved”.
