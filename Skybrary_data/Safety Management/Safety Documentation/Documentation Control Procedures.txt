Managing and operating a SMS generates significant amount of information. There is a wide variety of documents and electronically stored data from various sources used or originated by the SMS. A disciplined approach to information and documentation management and strict documentation control are essential for the successful implementation and operation of the safety management system. Documentation regarding the operation of SMS is best be presented in clear and unambiguous statements, dated with the timestamps of any revisions, maintained in an orderly manner and revised at specified periods as determined by the organisation. The safety documentation is to be approved, as applicable, by the oversight authorities. Aviation service providers shall establish a documented process to update the SMS documentation when the safety management system is reviewed and modified. The obsolete and outdated documents shall be removed from usage or secured otherwise against unintended use. Successful organisations maintain the current versions of relevant safety documents not only at the safety department but also at other locations, including operational units which play an essential role for the effective functioning of the SMS. The main goal of documentation (and records) management is to guarantee access, exactness, reliability, security and quick availability of all useful information. To achieve this goal the documentation management and control procedures applied by an organisation should cover document identification, drawing up and presentation, verification, authorisation, distribution, update and filing.
