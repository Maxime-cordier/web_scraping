Under EU law, there are regulations dealing with the issue of investigation and reporting. Historically, Council Directive 94/56/EC of 21 November 1994 established the fundamental principles governing the investigation of civil aviation accidents and incidents. This was followed, in June 2003, by Directive 2003/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on occurrence reporting in civil aviation. The intent of Council Directive 94/56 was to transpose under EU law the standards of ICAO Annex 13. With the passage into law of Regulation 996/2010 on the investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation, Directive 94/56 was repealed and replaced by the new legislation. On 20 April 2014 Regulation (EU) No. 376/2014 on the reporting, analysis and follow-up of occurrences in civil aviation came into effect. The regulation, as well as its implementing rule, Regulation (EU) 2015/1018, became applicable on 15 November 2015 and repeals Directive 2003/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Commission Regulations (EC) No. 1321/2007 and (EC) No. 1330/2007. It also amends the aircraft accident investigation Regulation (EU) No. 996/2010. At the EUROCONTROL level, a EUROCONTROL Safety Regulatory Requirement dealing with Reporting and Assessment of Safety Occurrences in ATM (ESARR2) was adopted in 1999. Those instruments can be used towards the implementation of a Just Culture. However, as those instruments must be first transposed by the States, their implementation as resulted in different national legal frameworks with respect to safety reporting and the handling of safety information.
