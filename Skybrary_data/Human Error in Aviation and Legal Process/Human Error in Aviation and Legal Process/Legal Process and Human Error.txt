Air transport must expect to be subject to the same legal process as any other activity. Such legal process should be expected to be entirely separate from accident investigation, and the desirability of entirely open and honest safety reporting during everyday operations. It is in the public interest that those responsible for the safety of air operations should be accountable for their actions. However, it is also in the public interest that the behaviour and actions of those whose actions may have contributed to an accident are fully understood, especially in the wider context of organisational and social culture, and that lessons are learnt and action taken to reduce the risk of future accidents. This requires an open and honest safety reporting and compliance with safety investigations which may not be achieved if those involved are fearful of prosecution. In recent years, aviation professionals have been more and more concerned with what is considered an increased focus on legal issues in aviation safety occurrences. This has resulted in fear of prosecution and criminal sanctions for information provided in the context of safety occurrences investigations and reports, even in cases where tasks are perceived to be exercised in a responsible and professional manner. While such fears cannot defend a lack of compliance with mandatory reporting systems, they can nevertheless have an impact on the flow of important safety data, and consequently aviation safety. This lead the way to the development of the concept of “Just Culture”. At the heart of the argument of Just Culture is the underlying principle that there is very rarely any prior intent to be negligent, whether directly or indirectly, on the part of the professionals involved in aircraft accidents and incidents. There is now an identified need to achieve a balance between the needs and responsibilities of judicial authorities and aviation safety.
