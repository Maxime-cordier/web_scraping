The following is an extract from the A380-800 Wake Vortex Guidance: The Airbus A380-800, with a maximum take-off mass in the order of 560 000 kg, is the largest passenger aircraft ever to enter into revenue service. The aircraft is in the HEAVY wake turbulence category and ICAO Procedures for Air Navigation Services â€” Air Traffic Management (PANS-ATM, Doc 4444) apply. However, as vortices generated by the A380-800 are more substantial than for other aircraft in the HEAVY wake turbulence category, this guidance recommends an increase in relation to the wake turbulence separation minima published in the PANS-ATM. This is intended to ensure that aircraft operating near an A380-800 do not encounter wake vortices of a greater magnitude than are generated by other aircraft in the HEAVY wake turbulence category. States are strongly encouraged to implement this guidance pending an amendment to the PANS-ATM:
