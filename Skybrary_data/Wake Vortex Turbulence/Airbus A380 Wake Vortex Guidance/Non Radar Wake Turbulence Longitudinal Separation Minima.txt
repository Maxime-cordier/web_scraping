The following non-radar separation minima should be applied to aircraft landing behind an A380-800 aircraft: MEDIUM aircraft behind an A380-800 aircraft — 3 minutes;. LIGHT aircraft behind an A380-800 aircraft — 4 minutes.. A minimum separation of 3 minutes should be applied for a LIGHT or MEDIUM aircraft and 2 minutes for a non-A380-800 HEAVY aircraft taking off behind an A380-800 aircraft when the aircraft are using: the same runway;. parallel runways separated by less than 760 m (2 500 ft);. crossing runways if the projected flight path of the second aircraft will cross the projected flight path of the first aircraft at the same altitude or less than 300 m (1000 ft) below;. parallel runways separated by 760 m (2 500 ft) or more, if the projected flight path of the second aircraft will cross the projected flight path of the first aircraft at the same altitude or less than 300 m (1 000 ft) below.. A separation minimum of 4 minutes should be applied for a LIGHT or MEDIUM aircraft when taking off behind an A380-800 aircraft from: an intermediate part of the same runway; or. an intermediate part of a parallel runway separated by less than 760 m (2 500 ft)..
