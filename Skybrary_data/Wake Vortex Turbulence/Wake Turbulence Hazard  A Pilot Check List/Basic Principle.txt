The vortices generated at the wing tips of an airborne fixed wing aircraft, or from the rotors of a helicopter in forward flight, create transient rotational turbulence, which trails behind the aircraft in a descending and down wind direction, and may cause sudden un-commanded roll to affect a following aircraft, perhaps at a sufficient rate of roll to disconnect the autopilot if engaged. Light aircraft may also experience marked pitching moments when traversing a vortex from the side, such as when turning finals from base leg behind a larger aircraft. Opposing the induced roll moment using normal roll control (aileron and roll spoiler) is usually effective except when the wingspan and ailerons of the affected aircraft do not extend beyond the rotational flow of the two vortices (this can occur when the following aircraft is much smaller than the leading aircraft), or where one wing is caught in a sufficiently strong vortex there may not be enough roll authority from the remaining wing. The minimum traffic separation distances for aircraft under air traffic control (ATC) have consistently been shown to be sufficient to ensure that any loss of control caused by an encounter with wake turbulence will always be transient and easily recoverable except for some cases of spacing on approach to land or on initial climb following take off. To cover these circumstances, and various more complex permutations of runway use, minimum separation distances and times have been promulgated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).
