A 50-seat regional jet level at FL 370, with cabin service in progress and the seat belt signs off, encounters unexpected wake turbulence from an overtaking B777 also level at FL370 as it rejoins the same track 7nm ahead. Despite uncommanded autopilot disconnect, recovery to wings level is quickly achieved by PF, although not before one of the Cabin Crew has been thrown sideways and seriously injured by impact with a bulkhead and a passenger using the toilet has been slightly injured after being thrown against the compartment wall.. A Medium-category jet aircraft at FL360 encounters wake turbulence from a Heavy-category type aircraft descending 8 Nm ahead from FL380 through the same level. This induced an uncommanded large roll, up to about 60Â°, with altitude variation. The Captain immediately switched off Autopilot, turned the control wheel 43 degree to one side and after 2-3 seconds 15 degree to other side. Due to pilot action aircraft was brought back to wings level position.. A Medium-category jet aircraft enroute at FL320 had had just been cleared to climb to FL360. A Heavy-category type, enroute at FL330, had just passed in the opposite direction. The Medium-category jet aircraft suddenly rolled and the autopilot disconnected. The first officer assumed manual control of the aircraft, levelled the aircraft and re-engaged the autopilot. Both flights continued to their destinations for safe landings, however, 4 people on board the encountering aircraft received minor injuries as result of the wake turbulence encounter..
