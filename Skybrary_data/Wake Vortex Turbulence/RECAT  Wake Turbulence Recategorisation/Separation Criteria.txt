Under standard ICAO criteria, wake turbulence separation, for arrival or departure, can be charted as follows: Preceding Aircraft: Following Aircraft: Minimum Separation: HEAVY. HEAVY. 4.0 NM. HEAVY. MEDIUM. 5.0 NM. HEAVY. LIGHT. 6.0 NM. MEDIUM. LIGHT. 5.0 NM. Special separation standards of 6NM, 7NM and 8NM for a Heavy, Medium and Light respectively following a Airbus A380 also apply. In some regions, there are also special standards for aircraft following a Boeing 757. Under the RECAT programme, the required separation is as depicted in the following table. Leader/Follower: CAT A: CAT B: CAT C: CAT D: CAT E: CAT F: CAT A: 3 NM. 4 NM. 5 NM. 5 NM. 6 NM. 8 NM. CAT B: . 3 NM. 4 NM. 4 NM. 5 NM. 7 NM. CAT C: . . 3 NM. 3 NM. 4 NM. 6 NM. CAT D: . . . . . 5 NM. CAT E: . . . . . 4 NM. CAT F: . . . . . 3 NM. For time based separation on departure, the following values, in seconds, apply. Leader/Follower: CAT A: CAT B: CAT C: CAT D: CAT E: CAT F: CAT A: . 100s. 120s. 140s. 160s. 180s. CAT B: . . . 100s. 120s. 140s. CAT C: . . . 80s. 100s. 120s. CAT D: . . . . . 120s. CAT E: . . . . . 100s. CAT F: . . . . . 80s.
