After years of extensive, collaborative research between EUROCONTROL, the FAA, their research facilities and the aviation industry, the experts concluded that the required separation between certain aircraft could be safely decreased. Research had proven that, in addition to weight, other aircraft characteristics – such as speed and wingspan – also affect the strength of the wake generated as well as the following aircraft’s reaction to that wake. Using that information, under the RECAT-EU 6-category scheme, aircraft were re-assigned to one of six new categories (A through F) which were derived by redefining the transition weight between the old categories, adding a Super category and splitting each of the Medium and Heavy categories into two new ones. The resulting categorisation is as follows: CAT A - "Super Heavy". CAT B - "Upper Heavy". CAT C - "Lower Heavy". CAT D - "Upper Medium". CAT E - "Lower Medium". CAT F - "Light". The RECAT-EU distance-based minima and time-based minima have been approved by EASA and are published as AMC7 to the EU 2020/469 ATS.TR.220 Application of wake turbulence separation, and available for deployment. RECAT-EU is also integrated in the recently published ICAO enhanced wake separation minima based on wake turbulence group (Amendment 9 to Doc 4444 PANS-ATM edition from Nov. 2020). All aircraft types certificated prior to 01 January 2013 have been assigned to one of the new categories, with examples provided in the table below: Super Heavy: Upper Heavy: Lower Heavy: Upper Medium: Lower Medium: Light: CAT-A: CAT-B: CAT-C: CAT-D: CAT-E: CAT-F: AIRBUS A-380-800.
