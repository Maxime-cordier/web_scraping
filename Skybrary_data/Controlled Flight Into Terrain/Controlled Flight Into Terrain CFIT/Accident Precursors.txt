Study of CFIT accidents has enabled a large number of accident precursors to be identified. These precursors are not necessarily contributing factors, though some may be; but they are warnings revealing that a weakness has been detected in existing defence mechanisms. The identification of an accident precursor usually necessitates action to strengthen these defences. The article CFIT Precursors and Defences lists those CFIT precursors which have so far been identified, together with suggested lines of defence.
