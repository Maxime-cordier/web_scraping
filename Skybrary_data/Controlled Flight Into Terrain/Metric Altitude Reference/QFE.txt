Altimeter Pressure Settings (QFE) altimeter settings are the normal standard that ATC provides for approach procedures within the CTR. Most (but not all) airports will accommodate QNH approaches on request. It is essential that the pilots are aware of which altimeter reference they have been given and that they fly the depicted altitudes that correspond to that reference. This can be particularly confusing for pilots of an aircraft with only imperial (feet) referenced altimeters as the cleared altitudes are being provided in metres by ATC. As a safety crosscheck, it is very rare for the aircraft to be cleared below the altitude depicted on the chart for the next segment of the approach, and the aircraft will only be cleared below the depicted approach procedure platform altitude by means of an approach clearance. Therefore, if the cleared altitude, when converted to feet, is lower than that depicted on the plate, it is likely that the controller and the pilot are not using the same altimeter reference and clarification must be obtained.
