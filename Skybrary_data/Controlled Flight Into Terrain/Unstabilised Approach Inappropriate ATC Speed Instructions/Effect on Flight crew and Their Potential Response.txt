If an abnormally high workload is needed to achieve the required flight path, the ability of a flight crew to maintain situational awareness can be affected. There is an increased risk that an unstabilised approach could develop, which may then be difficult to correct, and culminate in either a go around or a poorly handled landing, with increased risk of a heavy landing or a runway excursion.
