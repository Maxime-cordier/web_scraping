It is common for an aircraft MEL to allow despatch with an unserviceable TAWS or GPWS system. If this is the case, the MEL entry often specifies that â€˜alternative procedures are to be established and used'. These may be fully specified in an associated Operations Manual or that Manual may simply give guidance on the action to be taken according to the specifically intended flight. This may include prohibition of flights into and out of particular airports under certain meteorological conditions or by night.
