With regard to the evolution of the ICAO USOAP beyond 2010, Assembly Resolution A36-4 in 2007 called for: The examination of the feasibility of applying a Continuous Monitoring Approach (CMA), while continuing to maintain as core elements the key safety provisions contained in Annexes 1, 6, 8, 11, 13 and 14, and -. Appropriate changes to USOAP to incorporate the analysis of safety risk factors and their application on a universal basis to assess States’ compliance with their oversight obligations, with adaptation of audit planning and scope accordingly.. The main objective of CMA is therefore to enhance States’ safety oversight and safety management capabilities by identifying safety deficiencies, assessing associated safety risks, developing strategies for mitigation, and re-evaluating States’ achieved safety performance levels. The benefits of CMA are embedded in the transition from a one-time assessment activity to a continuous monitoring process, which offers a long-term, cost-effective, more flexible and sustainable approach. Furthermore, it will be developed as a (web-based), real-time, interactive and effective operational system that provides for the collective sharing of safety data. The ICAO Safety and Security Audits Branch (SSA) is responsible for the development and implementation of the CMA, and will conduct the analysis and measurement of States’ safety oversight capability and identified safety risks. The Regional Offices will participate in safety data collection and validation activities, and exchange of information with SSA via the online framework. They will also ensure that corrective and mitigation actions are taken by States in their regions in a timely manner. At its annual coordination meeting with ICAO SOA in July 2009, EUROCONTROL SRU was invited to participate in the CMA Advisory Group (AG) and contribute to the provision of regular feedback to the CMA Working Group (WG) in better understanding the needs and expectations of both internal and external partners regarding the output of the CMA.
