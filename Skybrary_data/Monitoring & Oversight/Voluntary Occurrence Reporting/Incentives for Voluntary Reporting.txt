In a voluntary reporting system, the reporting person, without any legal or administrative requirement to do so, submits a voluntary incident report. To promote the process of voluntary reporting, regulatory agencies should offer incentives to report. For example, enforcement action may be waived for reported unintentional violations. A number of States claim they have included this incentive among the principles of their voluntary reporting systems; however opinions on its successful implementation diverge considerably. The general rule in voluntary reporting systems is that the reported information should not be used against the reporting person, i.e. such systems must be non-punitive, error-tolerant and just in order to encourage further reporting of safety related information.
