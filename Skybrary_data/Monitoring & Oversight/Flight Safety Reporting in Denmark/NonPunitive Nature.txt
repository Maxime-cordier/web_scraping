It is natural that air traffic controllers and other aviation professionals, like everybody else in society, may not be expected to involve themselves in reporting if they risk punishment. This reluctance to incriminate oneself is part of human nature. It is therefore important for the quality of a flight safety reporting system that individuals, within certain well-defined limits, are granted immunity from sanctions. The immunity cannot be, and is not, complete. It will always be necessary to punish individuals when they have been behaving in a grossly negligent way and, likewise, substance abuse cannot be tolerated. At the same time, experience from investigation shows that gross negligence and substance abuse are extremely rare factors in aviation incidents and accidents. When a reporting system is non-punitive, this means that no criminal action and no disciplinary measures will be undertaken against the reporter on the basis of information contained in reports submitted. However, this does not mean that reports may always be submitted without consequences. Experience has shown that action by the employer can sometimes be necessary in order to ensure safety (retraining, limitations in the amount of working positions, de-certification etc.). The important point, however, is that such consequences are never initiated with a penalising or disciplinary purpose. Rather, their purpose is to either ensure that the reporter is brought back to a level of competence required for his duties, or relieved of their duties in a dignified way accepted by himself and his colleagues.
