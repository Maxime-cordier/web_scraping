ICAO began conducting audits under the comprehensive systems approach in January 2005. This approach consisted of the following three phases: 1. Pre-audit phase. The information provided by the State in the State Aviation Activity Questionnaire (SAAQ) and Compliance Checklists (CCs) was reviewed prior to the audit to analyze the type of safety oversight organisation established by the State, the implementation of Annex provisions, and the differences from SARPs identified by the States. This allowed ICAO to tailor the audit in accordance with the level and complexity of aviation activities in the State and determine the duration of the audit as well as the size and required composition of the audit team. 2. On-site phase. An ICAO audit team visited the State to verify the information provided by the State and conduct an on-site audit of the Stateâ€™s system and overall capability for safety oversight. This includes an audit of the organization, processes, procedures and programmes established and maintained by the State to help it fulfil its ICAO obligations. 3. Post-audit phase. The ICAO audit team prepared the audit report following coordination with the State. In addition, the State developed and submitted corrective action plans (CAPs) to address the identified audit findings.
