States bear a responsibility for the regulation of the safety of their national aviation systems and services. The overall process through which this responsibility is discharged contains four main elements: Rule Preparation - the drafting of national rules, including appropriate consultation;. Rule Enactment - the passing of laws or other appropriate orders to give legal effect to the rules;. Safety Oversight - the monitoring of safe service-provision including verifying compliance with the rules;. Enforcement - taking appropriate action to deal with cases of non-compliance.. At the national level, these four functions may be exercised by one body, empowered by the national government. Alternatively, the separate functions may be distributed, or may not exist. For example, and depending on the severity of the case, responsibility for enforcement action (following non-compliance) can be passed to a legal body such as the national department of justice (or similar). Increasingly in European civil aviation, rule preparation and enactment has been passed to European-level bodies such as the European Commission or the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). This has, in turn, led to the identification of national bodies for safety oversight.
