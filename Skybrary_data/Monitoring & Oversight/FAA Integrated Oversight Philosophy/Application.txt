The Integrated Oversight Philosophy applies to the safety oversight programs of all FAA organizations that have regulatory oversight responsibilities. This policy embraces many interdependent principles including; RBDM, safety management systems (SMS), the FAA Compliance Philosophy (now called the Compliance Program), and voluntary safety reporting programs. The Compliance Philosophy, established in FAA Order 8000.373, was the first step in the FAAâ€™s culture shift to use safety management principles to proactively address emerging safety risks. The Integrated Oversight Philosophy references the Compliance Philosophy and requires that it be incorporated into all FAA oversight systems.
