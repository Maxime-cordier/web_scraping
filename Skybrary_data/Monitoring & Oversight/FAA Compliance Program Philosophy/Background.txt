FAA is the regulatory body that establishes regulations to ensure safe operations in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). In turn, the aviation and aerospace communities have a statutory obligation to comply with established regulatory standards and must develop and use processes and procedures that prevent deviation from those standards. To promote the highest level of safety and compliance with regulatory standards, FAA is implementing safety management system constructs based on comprehensive safety data sharing between FAA and the aviation community. To foster this open and transparent exchange of data, FAA believes that its Compliance Program, supported by an established safety culture, is instrumental in ensuring both compliance with regulations and the identification of hazards and management of risk.
