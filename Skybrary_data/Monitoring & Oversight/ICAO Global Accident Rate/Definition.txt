The ICAO Global Accident Rate is an indicator used by ICAO to measure the global safety performance on a yearly basis. The methodology used to trend and define this indicator is described in the ICAO Methodology for Accident Rate Calculation and Trending. Accidents are the events as defined by the ADREP Occurrence Class Taxonomy, limited to commercial scheduled flights and aircraft with a MTOW over 2550 kg. The number of accidents has been extracted from the ICAO ADREP/ECCAIRS database. The number of annual commercial scheduled flights has been extracted from the ICAO statistical database on the air transport industry.
