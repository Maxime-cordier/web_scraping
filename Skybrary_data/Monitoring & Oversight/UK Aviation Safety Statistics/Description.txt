In the United Kingdom, the safety regulation of UK civil aviation is the responsibility of the UK Civil Aviation Authorityâ€™s Safety Regulation Group (SRG). The CAA's responsibility is therefore to provide the regulatory framework within which the industry must work and thereafter to monitor performance to be satisfied that required standards are set and maintained. Accordingly, the CAA has established a Mandatory Occurrence Reporting Scheme (MORS) to complement normal industry procedures, mechanisms and systems. Under this scheme, all safety hazards or potential hazards involving UK registered aircraft or aircraft in UK airspace are required to be reported to SRG's Safety Investigation and Data Department.
