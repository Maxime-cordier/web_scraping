Significant increases in the volume of air travel have made it more of a burden for many States to oversee their airlines in compliance with ICAO requirements under the Chicago Convention. To maintain confidence in the system, and to protect the interest of the European citizens who may be living in the vicinity of airports or travelling onboard a third-country aircraft, the EU identified the need to effectively enforce international safety standards within the Community. This is done through the execution of ramp inspections on third-country aircraft landing at the airports located in the Member States. The official definition of ‘third-country aircraft' is an aircraft which is not used or operated under the control of a competent authority of a Community Member State. The SAFA Directive provides a legal requirement for EU Member States to perform inspections, including ramp checks and, as such, participate in the EC SAFA programme. The “Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005 on the establishment of a Community list of air carriers subject to an operating ban within the Community and on informing air transport passengers of the identity of the operating air carrier” provides the mechanism and the criteria for the establishment of the list of airlines to be banned from European airspace for safety reasons. Commission Regulation (EC) No 473/2006 of 22 March 2006 lays down implementing rules for the establishment of the Community list, called also the “Blacklist”.
