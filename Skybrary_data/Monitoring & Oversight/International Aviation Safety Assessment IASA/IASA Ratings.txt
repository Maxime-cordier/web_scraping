The FAA established two categories of ratings for countries to signify the status of a CAA's compliance with minimum international safety standards: Category I -- FAA has found that the country meets ICAO standards for safety oversight of civil aviation, or. Category II -- FAA has found that the country does not meet those standards.. Carriers from Category 1 countries are permitted to operate into the U.S. and/or codeshare with U.S. air carriers in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT) authorizations. Carriers from Category 2 countries that operate into the U.S. and/or codeshare with U.S. air carriers have such services limited to levels that existed at the time of the assessment. Carriers from Category 2 countries that seek to initiate commercial service into the U.S. and/or seek to codeshare with any U.S. air carrier are prohibited from initiating such services. Deficiencies found in FAA assessments typically fall into these major categories: Lack of advisory documentation;. Shortage of experienced airworthiness staff;. Lack of control on important airworthiness related items such as issuance and enforcement of Airworthiness Directives, Minimum Equipment Lists, investigation of Service Difficulty Reports, etc.;. Lack of adequate technical data;. Absence of Air Operator Certification (AOC) systems,. Nonconformance to the requirements of the AOC System. Lack or shortage of adequately trained flight operations inspectors including a lack of type ratings;. Lack of updated company manuals for the use by airmen;. Inadequate proficiency check procedures; and. Inadequately trained cabin attendants..
