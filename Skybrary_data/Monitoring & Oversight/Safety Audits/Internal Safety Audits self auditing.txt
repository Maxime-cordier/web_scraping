Internal safety audits and safety surveys should be used by the aviation service providers to assess the level of compliance with the applicable regulatory framework and the organisational SMS processes and procedures, to verify the effectiveness of such processes and procedures and to identify corrective measures if needed. Planning of the audits should take into account the safety significance of the processes to be audited and the results of previous audits. An annual audit program should include: Definition of the audits, in terms of criteria, scope, frequency, and methods;. Description of the processes used to select the auditors;. The requirement that individuals shall not audit their own work;. Documented procedures for assignment of responsibilities, planning and conduct of audits, reporting results and maintaining records;. Audits of contractors and vendors.. According to ICAO Doc 9774 - Manual on Certification of Aerodromes, an aerodrome operator should arrange for an audit of the aerodrome SMS, including an inspection of the aerodrome facilities and equipment. For conducting such a large scale safety audit “the aerodrome operator should also arrange an external audit for the evaluation of aerodrome users, including aircraft operators, ground handling agencies and other organizations” operating at the aerodrome.
