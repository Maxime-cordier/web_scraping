An important change mandated by Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011, in comparison with the former JAR FCL system, is the inclusion of CC attestations in the same framework regulating flight crew licenses. In addition, licenses for the operation of aeroplanes, helicopters, sailplanes and balloons are all within the scope of the same regulatory framework whereas licences for the operation of sailplanes and balloons were previously issued in accordance with national requirements. With EASA Air Crew regulations competence-based modular instrument rating and en-route instrument rating have been introduced. The overall objective is to make an instrument rating more easily achievable by general aviation pilots requiring only 10 hours of dual flight instruction at an ATO, compared with the 50 hours required for a standard rating. The competence-based rating allows prior instrument experience to be credited so as to permit easier qualification for instrument ratings by general aviation pilots (including TC IR experience). The LAPL did not exist in the previous JAR FCL scheme and it is now valid in all EU countries with restrictions on aeroplane/helicopter weight (maximum take-off mass of two metric tonnes or less) and with no more than four people on board the aircraft (including crew and passengers). Finally with EASA Air Crew there exists no more the distinction between FTO (flight training organisation), TRTO (type rating training organisation) and RF (registered facility). The distinction has been replaced by the definition of ATO (approved training organisation) for organisations providing flight crew training.
