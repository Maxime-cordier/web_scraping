The term Air Traffic Safety Electronic Personnel (ATSEP) describes those technical specialists working to provide and support the electronics and software which enable air traffic service (ATS) systems to function. ATSEP comprise engineers, technicians, and computer hardware and software specialists who are responsible for the specification, procurement, installation, calibration, maintenance, testing and certification of ground electronic systems used to help control aircraft movements. In the context of a regulatory environment, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) describes ATSEP as "personnel proven to be competent in the installation, operation, and/or maintenance of a communications, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) system. ICAO Doc 10057, Manual on Air Traffic Safety Electronics Personnel Competency-based Training and Assessment, said it is the responsibility of the air navigation service provider (ANSP) to define the scope of ATSEP activities. In recent years there has been more formal recognition of the role played by ATSEP in delivering safety and of their role in the safety chain. At a time of increasing complexity of the air traffic system, it is important to minimise the risk arising from technical and engineered systems, and to ensure their correct functioning.
