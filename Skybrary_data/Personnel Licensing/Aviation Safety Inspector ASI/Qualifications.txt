Inspectors work in one of three basic areas -- operations, airworthiness or manufacturing. Within each of these areas, training/experience requirements for a position will depend on the type of work to be performed. For example, if a an aviation safety inspector (operations) is primarily involved with air carrier operations, the requirements are different than if the individual is primarily focused on general aviation operations. In addition, all of the inspectors must meet basic educational and medical requirements.
