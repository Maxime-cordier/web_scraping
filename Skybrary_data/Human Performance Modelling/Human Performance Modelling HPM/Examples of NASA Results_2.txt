modeling architectures.” In their chapter, Kevin M. Corker, Koji Muraoka, Savita Verma, Amit Jadhav and Brian F. Gore described HPM’s maturity and suitability for analyzing human factors in air traffic management systems and flight management systems. “This level of careful insight provides information important to the understanding of air traffic and flight management as it is actually performed — as opposed to how it is presumed to occur or how it is prescribed to occur,” they said. These authors realised that, as they documented their NASA work in 2008, HPM seemed mature enough to generate unprecedented discoveries. They specifically credited HPM with introducing “important tools in the arsenal of design, analysis and evaluation tools used by aviation safety researchers and system designers.”
