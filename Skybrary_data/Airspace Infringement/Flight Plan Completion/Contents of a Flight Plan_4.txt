the whole cruising portion of the flight, in terms of: a) kilometres per hour expressed as “K” followed by 4 figures Example: K0220 (which means 220 km/h true airspeed) b) knots expressed as “N” followed by 4 figures Example: N0175 (which means 175 knots true airspeed) There is also an option to indicate speed as Mach number but as it is not used by GA no details will be provided. General aviation example: N0150 (assuming that You will fly with speed 150 knots) (B) Cruising Level (maximum 5 characters) Insert the planned cruising level for the first or the whole portion of the route to be flown, in terms of: a) flight level, expressed as “F” followed by 3 figures or Example: F085 (which means flight level 085), b) standard metric level in tens of metres, expressed as “S” followed by 4 figures Example: S0150 (which means 1500 metres) c) altitude in hundreds of feet, expressed as “A” followed by 3 figures Example: A055 (which means 5500 feet altitude) d) altitude in tens of metres expressed as “M” followed by 4 figures Example: M0610 (which means 6100 metres altitude) e) only for uncontrolled VFR flights, the letters “VFR”. General aviation example: A065 (assuming that You will fly at 6500 feet altitude) (C) Route (including changes of speed, level and/or flight rules) To fill in the “Route” field use points (1) to (6) below and after each element add a single space. (1) Flights along designated ATS Routes: Insert, if the departure aerodrome is located on, or connected to the ATS route, the designator of the first ATS route. If the departure aerodrome is not on, or is not connected to the ATS route, insert the letters DCT, followed by the joining point of the first ATS route and followed by the designator of the ATS route. Example: DCT RONEX L617 … Then insert each point at which either a change of speed or level, a change of ATS route, and/or a change of flight rules is planned. Example: TRZ/N0200A080 IFR (which means that at point TRZ you are to change speed to 200 knots, altitude to 8000 feet and request to change flight rules to IFR). After each point add the designator of the next ATS route segment, even if the same as the previous one or by DCT , if the flight to the next point is outside a designated route, unless both points are defined by geographical co-ordinates. (2) Flights outside designated ATS Routes: Insert points normally not more than 30 minutes flying time or 370 km (200 NM) apart including each point at which a change of speed or level, a change of track, or a change of flight rules is planned or when required by the appropriate ATS authority(ies). Insert DCT between successive points unless both points are defined by geographical co-ordinates or by bearing and distance. (3) ATS route (2 to 7 characters) Insert the coded designator assigned to the route or route segment including,
