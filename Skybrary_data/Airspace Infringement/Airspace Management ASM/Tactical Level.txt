The tactical level includes activities related to the implementation of the AUP/UUP, such as activation and deactivation of SUAs, reallocation of airspace, resolution of specific airspace problems and situations between civil ATS units and military controlling units. Examples of such situations include OAT flights crossing ATS routes, GAT flights crossing TRAs, deactivation of danger areas due to aircraft in distress needing to pass through that airspace, etc. Airspace users, which previously requested airspace, advise the AMC about changed in their planning (e.g. activity completed earlier than planned, cancelled or reduced in time or volume) so that the airspace can be available for additional period(s) than the planned. The tactical level of ASM relies on the use of real-time data, including flight data (flight plans, estimates, etc.) as well as controller intentions and plans. System support tools are often available, e.g. electronic coodination features, OLDI messages (e.g. XRQ - crossing request), etc.
