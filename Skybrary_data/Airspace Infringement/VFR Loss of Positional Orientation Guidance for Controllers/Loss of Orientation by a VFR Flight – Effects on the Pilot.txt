If a pilot becomes unaware of their exact position, common outcomes are airspace infringement, loss of separation and controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). In mountainous terrain, or in deteriorating weather conditions, the pilot may get into a situation where they do not have the aircraft performance or skills to avoid impact with terrain. If, because of stress and/or loss of visual cues, the pilot becomes spatially disorientated, a condition which occurs when a pilot is unable to correctly interpret aircraft attitude, altitude or airspeed, then the outcome may be loss of control and CFIT. What to expect as a controller: High level of stress in the cockpit – particularly for pilots who are less experienced with instrument flying techniques;. Non-standard phraseology – the pilot might revert to non-standard phraseology when explaining the current situation, last known location or even might be reluctant to admit that visual orientation is lost.. Random combination of manoeuvres – the pilot might start manoeuvring in order to gain visual contact with terrain regardless of unsafe proximity to terrain, to adjacent TMAs, danger areas and reserved airspace areas..
