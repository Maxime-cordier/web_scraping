Airspace infringement occurs when an aircraft penetrates an area into which special clearance is required without having such clearance. A major cause of airspace infringement is breakdown of communications with Air Traffic control. This may result from: lack of knowledge or understanding of procedures for obtaining clearance to enter or cross controlled airspace; or,. failure to follow correct procedures for crossing or entering controlled airspace..
