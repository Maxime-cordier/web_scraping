To meet the growing public demand for air transport and expanding need for air traffic services, the Transport Ministers of the ECAC adopted an En-Route Strategy on 24 April 1990. A major Airspace Management objective was the implementation of the Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA) Concept. This FUA Concept was introduced in March 1996 after development by civil and military representatives of the ECAC States together with representatives of Aircraft Operators. The introduction of the FUA Concept is based on the fundamental principle that airspace is one continuum to be allocated for use on a day-to-day basis to accommodate user requirements.
