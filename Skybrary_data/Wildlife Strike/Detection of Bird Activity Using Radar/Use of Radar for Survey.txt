Even where it cannot be justified for permanent real-time bird activity monitoring, radar is increasingly being seen as an important component of bird hazard assessment at airports and as a means to target the airport operator’s risk management effort effectively. The key to success is to arrange for the deployment of mobile equipment for limited but carefully selected periods and ensure that automated data logging of bird movements is accomplished in a way that facilitates meaningful analysis. Ideally radar coverage will extend to the whole of the ICAO-defined 13km radius bird ‘safeguarding’ zone and include altitudinal coverage up to 5000 ft. The very latest developments in survey are looking at the systematic detection and recording of birdstrike ‘Near Miss Events’ - NMEs. The principle is that, if radar can detect 100% of near miss events in a way which permits structured - and automated - analysis, then hazard mitigation performance measurement will in future be able to be proactive - the detection of risk, rather than reactive - the recording of actual strikes. Hazard management may thereby be informed in a more timely manner and with real safety benefit where bird hazard is high.
