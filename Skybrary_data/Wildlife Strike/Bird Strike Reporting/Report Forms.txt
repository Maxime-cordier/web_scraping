Bird strike report forms used by States (or accepted as operator substitutes for the State Form) vary and there is not always provision for the bird species involved to be recorded if known or even described as seen. Also, some forms are too detailed and overly complex to complete with lots of descriptive text. As a general rule, report forms should be relatively short and their completion should be self explanatory. States which report data in a significantly different format from that required by IBIS (ICAO Birds Strike Information System) are urged by ICAO to comply with the format of the IBIS reporting form, especially when key data fields are omitted.
