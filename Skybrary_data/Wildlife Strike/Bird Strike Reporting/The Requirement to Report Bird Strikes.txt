By the provisions in ICAO Annex 14, Aerodrome Design and Operations, Volume I, bird strikes are required to be reported at national (member State) level. Section 9.4.2 of the same Annex requires that “Bird strike reports shall be collected and forwarded to ICAO for inclusion in the ICAO Bird Strike Information System (IBIS) database”. To facilitate this obligation, States are expected to take appropriate action to collect data from aircraft and airport operators, although the effectiveness of this process varies very widely and geographical bias in the overall data coverage results. According to IR-OPS CAT.GEN.MPA.105 Responsibilities of the commander, paragraph (d), Bird hazards and strikes: "(1) Whenever a potential bird hazard is observed, the commander shall inform the air traffic service (ATS) unit as soon as flight crew workload allows." "(2) Whenever an aircraft for which the commander is responsible suffers a bird strike that results in significant damage to the aircraft or the loss or malfunction of any essential service, the commander shall submit a written bird strike report after landing to the competent authority." According to EU-OPS 1.420 subpart (d) section 3. recommendations: “(i) A commander shall immediately inform the local air traffic service unit whenever a potential bird hazard is observed.”, and “(ii) If he is aware that a bird strike has occurred, a commander shall submit a written bird strike report after landing to the Authority whenever an aircraft for which he is responsible suffers a bird strike that results in significant damage to the aircraft or the loss or malfunction of any essential service. If the bird strike is discovered when the commander is not available, the operator is responsible for submitting the report.”
