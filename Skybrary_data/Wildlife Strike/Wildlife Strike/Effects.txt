Wildlife strikes can be a significant threat to safety of aircraft. The impact of wildlife strike has been experienced to cause: Cracked or broken windshield and consequently, depressurization and possibly pilot injury.. Engine failure due to ingestion, resulting in aborted take-off or emergency landing.. Structural damage to the fuselage, control surfaces or landing gear which could potentially lead to e.g. depressurization, Loss of Control or emergency landing.. Other effects, for example blockage of Pitot Static System air intakes which can cause dependent instrument readings to become erroneous.. The damage caused depends on a number of factors: Aircraft size - smaller aircraft can withstand less damage before the safety of flight is compromised and are generally more vulnerable.. Animal size and weight. The weight of an animal is directly proportional to the energy to be absorbed in an impact.. Speed during impact - the kinetic energy to be absorbed is proportional to the square of the relative speed of the two objects. Normally the aircraft is much faster and therefore the animal speed can be disregarded..
