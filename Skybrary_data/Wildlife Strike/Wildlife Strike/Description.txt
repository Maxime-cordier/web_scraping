A wildlife strike is a collision between an animal and an aircraft which is in flight or on a take off or landing roll. The term to describe such events was initially bird strike since this was the most common scenario. However, the increased number of flights and airfields used resulted, among other things, in the increase of collisions between aircraft and animals other than birds. Wildlife strikes may occur during any phase of flight but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases. The reason is that most birds fly at lower levels and other animals (except bats) can only hit an aircraft while on the ground. The specific aspects of wildlife strikes are discussed in the dedicated articles Bird Strike and Non Avian Wildlife Hazards to Aircraft.
