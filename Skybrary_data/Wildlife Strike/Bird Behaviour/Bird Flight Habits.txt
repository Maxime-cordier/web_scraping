Small birds ‘going somewhere’ tend to fly at around 20 kts whereas larger birds, such as geese, may reach speeds of up to 40 kts. Day to day flight altitudes for most birds are in the range 30 feet to 300 feet above ground level (agl). Outside that range, they rarely exceed 1000 feet agl unless on long distance migration flights. These typically occur at a 5000 - 7000 feet altitude, subject to terrain, but have sometimes been detected at over 20000 feet.
