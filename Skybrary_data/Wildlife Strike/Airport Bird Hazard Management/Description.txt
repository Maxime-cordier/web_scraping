Since aircraft bird strike hazard is greatest at low altitudes (because that is where bird activity is most heavily concentrated) and at or near airports (because that is where the greatest concentration of aircraft is found), much of the focus on bird hazard management is on airports. Operators of aircraft have a reasonable expectation that any bird hazard which may exist at an airport that they utilise will be controlled to a level which eliminates exceptional risk. Many States have detailed guidelines and compliance procedures to ensure that their airports achieve this but, despite the existence of related ICAO SARPs, there is no uniformity of achieved standards. This article summarises the main principles of an appropriate management approach for airport operators.
