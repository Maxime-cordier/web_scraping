Velocity is a vector, which simply means that it is defined by two parameters, speed and direction. A specification of wind velocity therefore requires that both wind direction and wind speed are given. Wind direction is always given as a radial measure in degrees stating the direction from which the wind is blowing. Wind speed may be given in either knots (nautical miles per hour) or metres per second depending upon the procedures of the State concerned. Caution: Many references to wind measurement from non-expert sources equate ‘wind velocity’ with ‘wind speed’ and therefore typically refer to ‘wind velocity and direction’ which is incorrect. The Flight Safety Foundation Notes listed under Further Reading below are examples of this error.
