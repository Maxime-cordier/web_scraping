Simulations carried out by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Brisbane, Australia-based Bureau of Meteorology, suggest that warm-core cyclones, moving inland over northern Australia, can indeed intensify when the underlying soil is sufficiently warm and wet and are maintained by heat transfer from the soil. The simulations also suggest that when the storms are sufficiently isolated from their oceanic source of moisture, the rainfall they produce is insufficient to keep the soil wet enough to transfer significant quantities of heat, and the storms then decay rapidly. In order for the warm core cyclone effect to take place, three land conditions must be met: the ground must be very warm and the atmosphere must have minimal temperature variation.. The ground must be very wet or saturated and so this land 'mimics' the sea - and hence the name 'brown ocean effect.' The high amount of moisture in the soil then allows a high rate of evaporation, which then acts as a source of heat energy for the storm or cyclone, technically known as latent heat - similar to the process over the sea.. The amount of this latent heat must be at a certain level - at least 70 watts per square metre. Over the sea it would normally be around 200 watts per square metre. Studies have found that the latent heat released must measure at least 70 watts averaged per square meter and concluded that latent surface heat flux from land surfaces actually have the potential to be larger than from the ocean, albeit for brief periods only.. These conditions were met in Texas and Oklahoma in June 2015. In early summer 2015, the ground had warmed up enough, and it was saturated following a record wet May. The latent heat had also reached or exceeded the required level.
