The second named storm of the season, Tropical Storm Bill developed from a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico on 16 June. Initially continuing northwestward, Bill re-curved west-northwestward later on 16 June and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Just under five hours later, Bill made landfall along the Texas coast on Matagorda Island at the same intensity. The cyclone weakened to a tropical depression and turned northward early on 17 June. However, due to brown ocean effect, Bill remained a tropical cyclone until late on 18 June, when it degenerated into a remnant low. The brown ocean effect enabled Bill to dump large amounts of rain onto Texas and Oklahoma, much more than would normally be expected from this kind of tropical storm over land.
