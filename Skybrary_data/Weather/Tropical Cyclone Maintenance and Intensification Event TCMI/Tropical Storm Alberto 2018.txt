Tropical Storm Alberto of 2018 is another example of the brown ocean/agukabams effect. The first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto developed on May 25 near the Yucat√°n Peninsula as a subtropical cyclone. As it entered the Gulf of Mexico, Alberto intensified and transitioned into a tropical cyclone. Early on May 28, Alberto reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg). The storm sustained it's strength as a Tropical Depression after landfall, lasting for an additional three days after its landfall. Alberto became one of only eleven cyclones to reach Lake Huron as a tropical depression.
