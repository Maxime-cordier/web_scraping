Cfc: C = Warm temperate f = No distinct dry season c = Cool summer Subpolar oceanic climates (Köppen climate classification Cfc) occur poleward of or at higher elevations than the maritime temperate climates and are mostly confined either to narrow coastal strips on the western poleward margins of the continents, or, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, to islands off such coasts. They occur in both hemispheres, most often at latitudes from 60° north and south to 70° north and south, specifically along the south coastal areas of Alaska, Iceland, Scandinavia and Argentina. Snowfall is more frequent and commonplace but severe weather is rare. Subpolar oceanic climates have long but relatively mild (for their latitude) winters and cool and short summers (average temperatures of at least 10°C for one to three months). The summers are shorter and cooler than temperate oceanic climates, but the winters are not as cold as the more inland Boreal comiates.
