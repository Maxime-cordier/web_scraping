Maintain awareness of snowfall forecasts and runway clearance operations. Consider carrying contingency fuel in case of unexpected delays to approach while snow clearance operations are in progress. While severe weather is rare, be mindful of the risk of in-flight icing and the impact on aircraft performance, especially in the climb. Pay attention to temperature error correction when operating in low ambient temperatures.
