Infrastructure Planning: Contingency plans should be in place to enable rapid restoration of ATM and airport services in the aftermath of a destructive tropical storm, in order to allow humanitarian operations and minimise economic disruption.. Flight Planning: Operators need to keep a close watch on tropical storm development and progress and plan schedules accordingly. Crews need to consider the weather not only for the duration of the flight but also the time that the aircraft will subsequently be on the ground. Consider securing the aircraft if the aircraft are not to be evacuated. Changes in the movement of the storm can have a significant effect on the accuracy of forecast en-route winds and therefore crews should consider carrying extra contingency fuel if planning to fly close to such a storm. In the aftermath of a storm, crews should check NOTAMs to ensure that en-route alternates, affected by the storm, are capable of handling the flight in the event of a diversion..
