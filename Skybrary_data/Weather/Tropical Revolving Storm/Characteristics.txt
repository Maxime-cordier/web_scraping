The diameter of a tropical storm is generally less than 500 nm and often only 100 nm in its early stages of development. With pressure frequently about 960 millibars, and often much less, the pressure gradient is such that winds regularly reach hurricane force. The circulatory velocity of these storms is so great that, once formed, no frontal structure can persist and they become almost symmetrical circular depressions. The factors which contribute to the intensity of a revolving storm are: Instability. Tropical revolving storms usually form close to the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where there is marked instability.. Humidity. Storms mainly occur over the western parts of the tropical oceans where the air has had a long passage over the sea, or where air has crossed over from the other hemisphere, and has become saturated.. Latitude. For a given pressure gradient the strength of the winds increases as the storm approaches the Equator.. Temperature: Tropical revolving storms form over water surfaces with a water temperature of at least 27C.. The number and severity of storms in a particular season are also influenced by other climatological factors including El Niño effect A tropical storm can only maintain its power when it is located over the warmest parts of the oceans - where surface waters are at 26°C or more. It will dissipate rapidly after crossing a coastline and moving inland, and it will lose energy more gradually if it strays into a region of cooler water.
