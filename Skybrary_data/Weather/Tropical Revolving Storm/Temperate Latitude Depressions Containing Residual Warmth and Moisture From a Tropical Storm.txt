Even when tropical storm has dissipated, there frequently remain extensive remnants of very warm and moist air in the upper atmosphere. If this warm and humid air is absorbed into the circulation of a travelling Atlantic temperate-latitude depression it may provide sufficient added energy to cause a dramatic intensification of that depression, and this is undoubtedly the cause of some (but by no means all) of the severe September gales that have swept north-west Europe over the years.
