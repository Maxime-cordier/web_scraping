The Aerodrome Weather Information Service (AWIS) is a service in Australia which provides a broadcast, to the aviation industry, of observed weather conditions at aerodromes from approved Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs). This information is provided by radio frequency (either via a standalone VHF transmitter or a navigation aid (NavAid)) and/or by telephone. In 2017, the Australian AWIS service was provided to approximately 230 aerodromes, with VHF broadcast being available at 115 aerodromes and phone services being available at more than 220 aerodromes.
