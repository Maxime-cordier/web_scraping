PIREPs are encouraged in virtually all airspace. In some parts of the world, air traffic facilities are required to solicit PIREPs when any of the following conditions are reported or forecast: ceilings at or below 5,000 feet. visibility at or below 5 miles (surface or aloft). thunderstorms and related phenomena. icing of light degree or greater. turbulence of moderate degree or greater. wind shear. reported or forecast volcanic ash cloud. Pilots are urged to cooperate and promptly volunteer reports of these conditions and other atmospheric data such as: cloud bases, tops and layers. flight visibility. precipitation. visibility restrictions such as haze, smoke and dust. wind at altitude. temperature aloft. The ground station receiving the Pilot Report will format and disseminate the information to all concerned parties. Beyond advising other aircraft in the immediate area of the hazard, the PIREP is used: by ATS for hazardous weather avoidance procedures. by the flight service centres to brief other pilots, to provide inflight advisories, and weather avoidance information to enroute aircraft. by the area control centre to expedite the flow of enroute traffic, to determine most favorable altitudes, and to issue hazardous weather information within the centerâ€™s area. by the national weather service to verify or amend the aviation forecast. In some cases, pilot reports of hazardous conditions are the triggering mechanism for the issuance of advisories. by the national weather service, other government organizations, the military, and private industry groups for research activities in the study of meteorological phenomena.
