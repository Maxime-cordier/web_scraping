A Pilot Report or PIREP is a report of the actual weather conditions as encountered by an aircraft in flight. Traditionally, these reports are transmitted by radio to an appropriate ground station for dissemination but, when necessary, they can be made by telephone after landing. More recently, appropriately equipped aircraft can automatically send meteorological reports using the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) programme.
