When providing a PIREP, the pilot should strive to be as accurate as possible. Mandatory information includes the location (normally reference a navigation aid or fix, the time, the altitude and the aircraft type followed by a description of the hazard. When describing the intensity of icing or turbulence, the pilot should use the standard definitions as per the National Aviation Authority (NAA) AIPs or other appropriate publication. The ground station receiving the PIREP will then code the information in a standardised format for dissemination.
