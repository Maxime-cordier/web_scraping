A winter waterspout, also known as a snow devil, an icespout, an ice devil, a snownado, or a snowspout, is an extremely rare instance of a waterspout forming under the base of a snow squall. Although usually weak, winter waterspouts have reached EF1 Intensity and have done some damage. Note: The terms "snow devil" and "snownado" also are sometimes used to describe a different phenomena, a spinning vortex close to the surface with no “parent cloud” that is filled with snow. This vortex is more similar to dust devils in the warmer climates.
