The term "winter waterspout" is used to differentiate between the common warm season waterspout and this rare winter season event. Very little is known about this phenomenon but for the formation of a winter waterspout, very cold temperatures need to be present over a body of water warm enough to produce fog resembling steam above the water's surface. This will set up the extreme lapse rates needed to support convective development. Temperatures are uniformly below freezing, and there is no liquid water in the parent cloud, only ice crystals and graupel.
