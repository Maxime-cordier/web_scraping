The Richardson number, Ri, is the dimensionless ratio of buoyant suppression of turbulence to shear generation of turbulence and is defined as: where g is the acceleration of gravity, β a representative vertical convective stability (commonly ∂θ/∂z, where θ is potential temperature), and ∂u/∂z (the change of wind speed with height) is a characteristic vertical shear of the wind. It is used as a dynamic stability measure to determine if turbulence will exist. The Richardson number is a component of the Graphical Turbulence Guidance product available on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Aviation Weather Center website.
