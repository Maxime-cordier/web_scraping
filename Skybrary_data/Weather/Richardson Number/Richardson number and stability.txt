The Richardson number is a turbulence indicator and also an index of stability. Meteorologists classify atmospheric stability in the surface layer as unstable, neutral, and stable. Strongly negative Richardson numbers indicate that convection predominates, winds are weak, and there is a strong vertical motion characteristic of an unstable atmosphere. Smoke leaving a source spreads rapidly vertically and horizontally. As mechanical turbulence increases, the Richardson number approaches zero, and the dispersion of a smoke plume decreases, approaching neutral stability where (∂θ/∂z) = 0. Finally, as the Richardson number becomes positive, vertical mixing ceases, and mechanical turbulence is dampened. The atmosphere becomes stably stratified, and very little vertical dispersion of a smoke plume occurs. Stability Classification: Richardson number: Comment: Stable. > 0.25. No vertical mixing, winds weak, strong inversion, mechanical turbulence dampened, negligible spreading of smoke plume. Stable. 0 < Ri < 0.25. Mechanical turbulence weakened by stable stratification. Neutral. Ri = 0. Mechanical turbulence only. Unstable. −0.03 < Ri < 0. Mechanical turbulence and convection. Unstable. Ri < −0.04. Convection predominant, winds weak, strong vertical motion, smoke rapidly spreading vertically and horizontally. Richardson number and stability
