The Diablo wind is created by the combination of strong inland high pressure at the surface typically over Nevada, strongly sinking air aloft due to upper-level convergence, and lower pressure off the California coast. The air descending from aloft as well as sinking on the leeside of the Coast Ranges compresses due to the higher pressure at lower levels as it sinks to sea level where it warms as much as 11 Â°C, and loses relative humidity. Warming and drying of offshore Diablo Winds As the air sinks, it heats up by compression and its relative humidity drops due to the increased temperature. This warming is in addition to, and usually greater than, any contact heating that occurs as the air stream crosses the Central Valley and the Diablo Valley. This is the reverse of the normal summertime weather pattern in which an area of low pressure (called the California Thermal Low) rather than high pressure lies east of the Bay Area, drawing in cooler, more humid air from the ocean. The dry offshore wind, already strong because of the offshore pressure gradient, can become quite strong with gusts reaching speeds of 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) or higher, particularly along and in the lee of the ridges of the Coast Range.
