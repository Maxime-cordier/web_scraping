Typically an aircraft will utilise the on-board weather radar to detect heavy precipitation indicating thunderstorms, icing and turbulence. However, it is possible that aircraft weather radar does not detect all thunderstorms (cumulonimbus) in the area and pilots would therefore find real-time data from an LDN to be most valuable[1]. Information from an LDN can be relayed via an airlineâ€™s operations department or through Air Traffic Services. However, it may also be possible to automatically display real-time data from an LDN, in the cockpit, if the aircraft systems are compatible and a contract with a service provider is available.
