Typhoons typically occur between the months of June and November and travel in a westerly, or north westerly direction, often passing over the Philippines, making landfall in South East China, Korea, or Japan. The frequency and severity of storms varies from year to year and may be influenced by other climatic factors such as El Nino/La Nina.
