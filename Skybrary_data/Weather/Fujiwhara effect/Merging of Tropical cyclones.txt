The Fujiwhara effect is most often mentioned in relation to the motion of tropical cyclones, although the final merging of the two storms is uncommon. The effect becomes noticeable when they approach within 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) of each other. Rotation rates within binary pairs accelerate when tropical cyclones close within 650 kilometres (400 mi) of each other. Merger of the two systems (or shearing out of one of the pair) becomes realised when they are within 300 kilometres (190 mi) of one another. The Fujiwhara effect is seldom seen in the Atlantic basin due to the lack of tropical cyclones and subsequent infrequent occurrence of two storms in close proximity. It is more common in the Pacific where tropical cyclones are more numerous.
