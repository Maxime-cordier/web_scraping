When entering higher latitudes, tropical cyclones can interact with extratropical cyclones. With the upper-level component of the extratropical system being stronger, the tropical cyclone is steered by it and can be drawn into it. Classic cases in the Atlantic include the famed Perfect Storm of October 1991 and Superstorm Sandy of October 2012.
