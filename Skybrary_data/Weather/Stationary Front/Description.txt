A stationary front is a weather front or transition zone between two air masses (cold and warm), when neither air mass is advancing into the other at a speed exceeding 5 knots at the ground surface. In terms of meteorological analysis, the front must be in roughly the same position between standard observations times of three or six hours. It is technically referred to as a quasi-stationary front since in the real world there is always some movement or undulation. The temperature difference across the front can be small or great depending on the nature of the two air masses involved.
