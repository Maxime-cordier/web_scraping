A pilot on final approach to an island airport sees active piled cumulus clouds (cumulus congestus) ahead, which is confirmed by the weather radar. He sees circular patterns of disturbance on the surface of the water ahead and, suspecting the presence of a waterspout, carries out a missed approach. As he climbs and turns away from the disturbance the aircraft experiences mild turbulence.
