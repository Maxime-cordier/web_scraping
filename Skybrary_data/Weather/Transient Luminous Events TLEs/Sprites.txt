Sprites are short-lived flashes of bright red light that occur above large storm systems, reach 50 â€“ 90 km in altitude, and are triggered by positive discharges of lightning between the top of a thundercloud and the ground (commonly called positive giants). Sprite is also an acronym for Stratospheric/mesospheric Perturbations Resulting from Intense Thunderstorm Electrification. They are reddish-orange or greenish-blue in colour with hanging tendrils (sometimes referred to as "carrot sprites") and arcing branches above. Unlike tropospheric lightning, sprites are cold plasma, similar to fluorescent tube discharge. Based on their shape and visual appearance, we distinguish three types of sprites: jellyfish, column and carrot sprites.
