A Thunderstorm is the term used to describe a convective cloud with associated heavy precipitation, typically heavy rain, heavy snow, or Hail, Thunder, and Lightning. Such a storm will be caused by either a single Cumulonimbus cloud (Cb) or a cluster, or line, of Cumulonimbus clouds. See the main article Cumulonimbus (Cb) for more detailed information.
