Operations in extremely low temperatures bring numerous challenges. There is little precipitation so airframe icing due to precipitation alone is less common than in lower latitudes. Aircraft avionics and other aircraft systems may well be adversely affected by cold soaking and the temperatures experienced may potentially be outside the envelope for many components. Manufacturers will provide guidance for operating in such an environment and there may be a need, for example, to remove the aircraft battery if the aircraft is to be parked outside of a hangar for any prolonged period of time. Pay careful attention to Altimeter Temperature Error and beware of optical illusions when flying VFR in an ice cap/ice sheet environment.
