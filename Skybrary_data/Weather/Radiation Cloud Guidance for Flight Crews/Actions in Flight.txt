If there are reasons to believe that the aircraft may be flying through, or at risk of flying through, radioactive material, the following actions may be prudent: Cabin Air. Minimise intake of contaminated air from outside the aircraft as much as possible. The ideal would be to prevent all external air from entering the cabin. The crew must have a clear understanding of how the air conditioning and pressurisation system works on their aircraft so that, together with company and manufacturersâ€™ recommendations, they can decide how best to configure the system.. 100% Oxygen. Use of flight crew oxygen masks, with 100% Oxygen selected, will reduce the likelihood of ingestion of airborne radioactive particles. Use of oxygen in such circumstance may leave insufficient to cater for more routine incidents such as fire or decompression and the height of terrain over which the flight will be conducted may be a further consideration. At the planning stage, potential use of oxygen and the consequent reduction in oxygen endurance will have a major impact on which route might be appropriate to avoid an area of known contamination..
