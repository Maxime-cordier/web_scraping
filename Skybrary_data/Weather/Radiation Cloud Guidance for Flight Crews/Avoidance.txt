A NOTAM should be published whenever an atmospheric release of radioactive materials or toxic chemicals has occurred following a nuclear or chemical incident. Meteorological offices, and the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) for the affected region, may provide forecasts for the movement of the material, for example on SIGMET charts, to enable forward planning of schedules to avoid any radioactive material in flight and fall-out of radioactive material. Operators should ensure that crews are aware of relevant NOTAMs and monitor developments. Routes should be planned taking into account the notified location of dispersing radioactive material. Where a flight has been planned to avoid such contamination, crews should consider the possibility that further in flight re-routing may become necessary. Commanders should give careful consideration to extra fuel requirements and the facilities at potential diversion airfields, including their capability to help deal with any actual or potential contamination of the aircraft, crew and passengers including medical support. ATC may be able to provide crews with updated information on the location of radioactive material and offer avoiding action. In certain circumstances, a diversion may be warranted.
