When flying in an area of forecast CAT, the crew should err on the safe side and keep the passenger seat belt sign illuminated. This may of course disrupt the cabin service and cause distress to passengers so the seat belt sign should not be left on unnecessarily.. If encountering unexpectedly strong headwinds: Record ground speed and fuel burn and try flying 2,000 ft and 4,000 ft lower. Compare the ground speed and fuel burn at those levels and fly at the level which gives the best specific ground range (the lowest kg/nm figure). Seek information from aircraft ahead and to the north and south of your planned track to find out what winds they are experiencing and consider adjusting your route to avoid the high winds. When you are eventually free of the strong headwinds, consider flying long range cruise/fuel economy speed and profile to conserve fuel. Start contingency planning for an intermediate fuel stop. Consider the consequences of the longer flight time e.g. destination weather forecast, opening times, crew duty times etc..
