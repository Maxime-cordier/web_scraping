Thundersnow, while relatively rare, is most common in the Great Lakes area of the United States and Canada, the Midwestern United States, the Great Salt Lake and across the Northeastern states and provinces of the United States and Canada. March is the peak month of formation. There are an average of fewer than 10 events per year. The British Isles and parts of northwestern Europe occasionally report thunder and lightning during sleet or (usually wet) snow showers during winter and spring. Thundersnow is also common around Kanazawa and the Sea of Japan, and even around Mount Everest. Low-pressure events in the eastern Mediterranean that originate from polar origin cause copious thundersnow occurrences during winter storms, especially over the elevated provinces of Israel and Jordan, including Amman and Jerusalem. The South Region of Brazil has also registered occasional episodes of thundersnow.
