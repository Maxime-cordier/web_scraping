Thundersnow, is an unusual kind of thunderstorm with snow falling as the primary precipitation instead of rain. It typically can occur within the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone or in mesoscale bands not associated with such a cyclone. Thermodynamically, it is no different than any other type of thunderstorm, but the top of the cumulonimbus cloud is usually quite low. In addition to snow, hail may fall as well. Overall, these storms are not as strong as in spring or summer when temperatures are warmer and the air is more unstable.
