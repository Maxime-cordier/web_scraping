Synoptic snow storms tend to be large and complex, with many possible factors affecting the development of thundersnow. One location in a storm to find thundersnow is typically in its northwest quadrant (in the Northern Hemisphere), within what is known as the "comma head" of a mature extratropical cyclone. Thundersnow is often located underneath the trough of warm air aloft which shows up in a surface weather analysis as an inverted trough extending backward into the cold sector from the main cyclone, where there is upper-level frontogenesis and strong upward motion. The convection is produced more by the strong lifting than typical instability. Other thundersnow storms can occur to the northeast of the cyclone center, ahead of the surface warm front. They are associated with conditional symmetric instability (CSI) sometimes found here and typically occur in the developing stage of an extratropical cyclone. In extreme cases, thunderstorms along the cold front are transported towards the center of the low-pressure system and will have their precipitation change to snow or ice, once the cold front becomes a portion of the occluded front.
