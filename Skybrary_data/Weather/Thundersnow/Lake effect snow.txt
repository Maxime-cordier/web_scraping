Lake effect thundersnow occurs after a cold front or shortwave trough aloft passes over a body of water. The relatively warm water heats the air near the surface and with cold air aloft, steep lapse rates mean convective development is possible. See the separate article on Lake Effect Snow for more detailed information.
