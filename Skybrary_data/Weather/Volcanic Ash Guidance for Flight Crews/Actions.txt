Oxygen. Use of flight crew oxygen masks may be advisable if the dust and sulphurous smell is strong.. Reduce thrust. Engine core operating temperatures of jet engines must be reduced below the temperature at which silicate ash particles melt (around 1,100°C). Reduction of engine thrust to flight idle is the only reliable way of achieving this in the absence of more precise guidance. If this action is not taken at or before the first signs of engine malfunction then flame out is likely to follow if clear air cannot be regained.. Reverse track and /or descend. Clear air must be regained as soon as possible. Terrain permitting, a descending 180 degree turn is likely to be the fastest way out of the contaminated air. Under no circumstances should a climb be attempted as an escape option.. Prepare aircraft systems for recovery from potential engine failure. Follow company/manufacturer’s guidance which may include advice on increasing the flow of bleed air to improve engine stall margins, and operation of the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) within Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) limits to provide a source of bleed air and electrical power in the event of multiple engine failure.. Monitoring. The engines will need careful monitoring, particularly the Engine Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) which may climb dangerously if there is significant ash contamination in the engine. Monitor aircraft attitude and airspeed remembering that airspeed indications may become unreliable if blockage of the pitot-static system occurs. Good awareness of the Ground Speed and head/tail wind component can be useful to help spot if indicated trends are genuine or not..
