Routes should be planned laterally and vertically to take account of active eruption plumes and clouds of dispersing volcanic ash notified by appropriate meteorological information, for example SIGMET charts. Other planning considerations include allowances for additional route fuel and allowances in the crew rest schedule. Night flights in regions known for regular explosive volcanic activity should be undertaken with especially careful pre flight planning because of the possibility that dangerous ash plumes, from new eruptions which have not yet been detected and notified, could be encountered.
