The polar vortices are cold-core low-pressure areas that strengthen in the winter and weaken in the summer due to their reliance upon the temperature differential between the equator and the poles. They usually span less than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) in which the air circulates in a counter-clockwise fashion (in the Northern Hemisphere) due to the Coriolis effect. The Northern Hemisphere vortex often has two centres, one near Baffin Island and the other over north-east Siberia. The Antarctic vortex in the Southern Hemisphere tends to be located near the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf near 160 west longitude.
