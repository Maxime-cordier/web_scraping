The breakup of the polar vortex is one of the main factors that determine the season transition (end of winter and beginning of spring).. The polar vortex can cause snowstorms and blizzards that affect large areas.. Ozone depletion occurs within the polar vortex, particularly over the Southern Hemisphere, and reaches a maximum in the spring.. Specific impact on aviation operations include very cold ground temperatures, necessitating significant corrections to approach and safety altitudes, as well as greater than average amounts of winter precipitation which could occur as snow or, in some cases, as freezing rain..
