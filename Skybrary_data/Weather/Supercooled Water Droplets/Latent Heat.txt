When water freezes, latent heat is released. This means that if a whole droplet was to freeze instantaneously, the latent heat liberated would, unless the initial temperature was below -80째C, raise the temperature of the droplet above 0째C which would be contradictory since ice cannot exist above 0째C. In fact only a small proportion of the drop freezes instantaneously, not more than enough to raise the temperature above 0째C. Further progressive freezing takes place as the droplet loses heat by evaporation and conduction. When freezing of supercooled droplets takes place spontaneously, the larger water droplets tend to freeze more readily than smaller droplets. The freezing of droplets becomes more probable as the temperature decreases. In aviation, small droplets will tend to freeze on the wing rather instantaneously, forming rough, white, opaque, ice deposits which are relatively easy to remove, called rime ice. The latent heat released in the freezing process serves to warm the air immediately surrounding the droplet relative to the air surrounding the cloud, thereby promoting instability and upward development of the cloud.
