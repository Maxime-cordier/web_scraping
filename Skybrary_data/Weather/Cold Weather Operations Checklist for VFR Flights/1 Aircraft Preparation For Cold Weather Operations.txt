a) in extremely cold temperatures all oil lines, oil pressure lines and tanks, in aircraft with reciprocating engines, should be inspected for proper insulation to preclude the possibility of oil congealing. Insulation must be fireproof and the installation accomplished by an experienced mechanic. b) baffles, winter fronts and oil cooler covers are recommended by some manufacturers (check for manufacturerâ€™s approval) c) check if oil and grease grades are as those specified by the manufacturer d) special care is recommended during the preflight to assure that the crankcase breather system (reciprocating engines) is free of ice. Check if modification of the system is necessary and if yes, if it is approved. e) inspect all hose lines, tubings, seals for any deterioration. Check all clamps and fittings. f) inspect the cabin heater system to eliminate the possibility of carbon monoxide entering the cockpit/cabin. g) check all control cables h) remember that feathering of oil pressure controlled propellers, in extreme cold, may lead to the situation where congealed oil will not allow the propeller to be unfeathered. i) if the airplane must be parked outside, wet cell batteries should be either kept fully charged or removed from the aircraft to prevent loss of power cause by cold temperatures. Dry cell batteries are resistant to power loss by freezing. j) look out for any mud or slush which thrown into wheel wells, during taxi and takeoff, may freeze in flight and cause landing gear operational problems. If possible, avoid surfaces covered with mud or slush and remove wheel pants (fixed-gear aircraft) to prevent the possibility of frozen substance locking the wheels/brakes.
