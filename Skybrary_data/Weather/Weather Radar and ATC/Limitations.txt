Making consecutive scans at different antenna attitudes takes time. The more the angles, the more precise the data but also the longer the period of information gathering. This can be somewhat mitigated by rotating the antenna slower and using a phased array for the vertical scan (which is faster compared to the mechanical adjustment of the antenna). Processing the weather data for a 360 degree coverage at multiple angles requires a lot of computing power. While modern computers can perform this task quickly, older equipment often needs several (e.g. 5-10) minutes.. Non-weather objects (e.g. flocks of birds, large groups of insects, wind turbines, etc.) produce returns that are similar to weather phenomena.. Only the radial component (i.e. the closing speed) can be determined. This can be mitigated if multiple radars are used. Another option is calculate the speed by comparing the consecutive positions of a particular phenomenon but this takes much longer.. Accuracy decreeses with distance. This happens because the beam becomes wider at longer distances. Therefore, accuracy at the end of the radar range is several times smaller than at close range, i.e. the position of distant phenomena is determined with greater error.. Cumulunimbus clouds usually develop very fast, often within 10-20 minutes (from a clear sky). They may also move quickly with the associated weather front (at speeds of around 30 knots). Depending on the equipment, collecting and processing of weather information can be time consuming to the extent that when the output data is available, the phenomenon: has travelled a considerable distance;. has developed but there is no current data to inform the controller about that;. has ceased to exist..
