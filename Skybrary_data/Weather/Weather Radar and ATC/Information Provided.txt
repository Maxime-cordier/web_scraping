While the basic operational principle of the ground weather radar is similar to that of the PSR, it can provide a much wider variety of information about the meteorological phenomena. This includes: Location (bearing and distance from the radar). These are determined by a calculation based on the echo delay (distance) and the azimuth of the antenna (bearing). As with the primary radar, the slant range is measured. Horizontal distance is determined by knowing the elevation angle.. Level (or level band). Unlike the PSR, the emitted signal is narrrow in the vertical plane. Therefore, by knowing the distance of the phenomenon and the antenna attidude, it is possibe to calculate the level. Note that this value is geometric, unlike the information derived from an aircraft's transponder (which is pressure-based). The vertical development of the phenomenon is determined by performing scans at different angles. This can be done by either moving the antenna vertically or by using a phased array to electronically steer the emitted signal.. Intensity/type. This is determined by processing the returns. The results need to be adjusted to the range, since a closer situated phenomenon would return the same signal as one that is of greater intensity but is farther. The intensity provides an idea about the phenomenon type. It should be noted that there is no exact match between these though.. Direction and speed of movement. This is determined by the doppler shift of the received signal.. ATC weather radar principle of operation Example of weather data on the situational display. Note that dull colours are used so that distraction is minimized. Different intensities are shown using a variety of fill patterns. Example of weather data on a separate display. Note the use of different colours as well as the vertical view (below and left of the planar view).
