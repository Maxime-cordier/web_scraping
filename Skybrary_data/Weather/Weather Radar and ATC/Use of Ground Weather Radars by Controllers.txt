Air traffic controllers may be presented with information from the weather radars integrated in their situational display or on a separate monitor. The advantage of the former is that the weather data and traffic situation are integrated. The drawback is that the display becomes more cluttered so it is more likely to cause a distraction or to have some important information obscured. To mitigate this, the weather data is normally presented in a more basic way compared to the view on a dedicated display. A specialized monitor usually uses a colour palette to present different intensities and may also provide 3-D information about the phenomenon while the integrated display is sometimes limited to just one colour with different patterns showing the different intensities. The use of this information is described in the local instructions (e.g. manual of operations). Depending on the reliability of the information, its use may vary from enhancing the controllers' Situational Awareness (e.g. what traffic begaviour to expect) to providing information to pilots or guidance on weather avoiding. For example, in the US controllers provide information about the location and intensity (light/moderate/heavy/extreme) of the precipitation. Radar navigational guidance is provided on request by pilots. Because of limitations described in the section above, weather information on the radar screen may be obsolete by the time it is available. Depending ot the situation, it may be useless, or, in some cases, even dangerous to rely on. For example, if a controller is trying to guide an aircraft to a gap between two CBs, it is possible that due to their development and/or movement (and the delayed information), the safe path has also moved or does not even exist anymore. As a result, controllers may only be allowed to use this information for enhancing their situational awareness.
