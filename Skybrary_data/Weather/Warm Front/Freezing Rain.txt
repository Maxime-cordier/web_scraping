Freezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass with an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. These super-cooled rain droplets freeze when they come into contact with the ground or other exposed surface, if the surface temperature is below 0°C. For further information see the separate article Freezing Rain.
