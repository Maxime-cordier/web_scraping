When the North Pole tilts away from the sun during the winter, the air above the pole becomes extremely cold, reaching temperatures as low as -80Â°C by December. Circulating around this cold pool is the stratospheric polar vortex with an area of low pressure at its centre. The vortex appears each winter in the stratosphere above the Arctic and exists until sunlight returns to the polar regions in the following spring. Due to the huge temperature difference between the cold polar air and the warm air at mid-latitudes, a jet stream flows around the perimeter of the vortex, known as the Polar Night Jet. This jet helps to lock the cold air in place within the stratosphere polar vortex. The Polar Night Jet flows west to east, sometimes in tandem with our own more familiar tropospheric jet stream some 20 km below.
