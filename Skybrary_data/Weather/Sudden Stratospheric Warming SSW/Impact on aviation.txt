Abnormal weather conditions clearly will have an impact on the infrastructure that supports aviation operations resulting in reduced system capacity, runway closures etc. Pilots need to reassess the risks associated with operations into familiar aerodromes. Where temperatures are much lower than is normally experienced, altimeter temperature error (for example) may well be significant.
