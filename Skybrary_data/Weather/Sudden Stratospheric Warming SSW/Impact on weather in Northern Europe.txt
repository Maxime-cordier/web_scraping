Weather systems normally arrive over northern Europe from the west — with a flow of relatively mild air coming in off the Atlantic. But a weaker jet stream means less flow of mild Atlantic air, weakening areas of low pressure and moving the jet stream further south. This leads to high pressure over the North Atlantic, 'blocking' that flow of mild Atlantic air and dragging in cold continental air from the east. Exactly how cold it might be depends on the details of where the air comes from. SSWs don't always result in this outcome — but a cold snap follows more often than not, so the SSW greatly increases the risk of wintry weather.
