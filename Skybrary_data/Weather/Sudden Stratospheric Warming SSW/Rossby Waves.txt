Sometimes the westerly flow of the tropospheric jet stream can be disrupted. These disruptions are caused by upward-travelling planetary waves, also known as Rossby Waves. These are giant meanders in high-altitude winds and occur in the atmosphere due to the Earth's rotation. These types of waves are generated by flow over mountains and continental land-sea temperature contrasts. They can also be generated by year-to-year changes in large scale weather patterns such as El Nino. With large land masses in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern this leads to more Rossby waves and so SSW events are largely a Northern Hemisphere focused phenomenon. There is only one known exception to this; in September 2002, a major warming was observed for the first time in the stratosphere in the Southern Hemisphere. Only Rossby waves with the greatest spatial scales are able to spread upward into the stratosphere. When the Rossby waves are strong, their amplitudes grow with height into the stratosphere where the waves break, just like on a beach. The breaking waves exert a drag on the Polar Night Jet, which weakens and distorts it. If these waves are strong enough, they may decelerate the jet sufficiently so that the westerlies turn easterly. Such a change in air flow disrupts the stratospheric polar vortex either by displacing it from its normal location over the pole or splitting it into two daughter vortices. Winds within the weakened jet slow down and turn toward the centre of the vortex. As the air converges in the centre of the vortex, it must then descend. This descent causes the air to compress and its temperature rises dramatically, sometimes by more than 50Â°C in just a few days. This descent also increases the pressure above the North Pole. Over the following weeks, the action of further Rossby waves allow the easterly winds to burrow down through the stratosphere. When they reach the tropopause, they often impact Atlantic weather systems and the jet stream.
