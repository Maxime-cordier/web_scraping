A clear understanding, by the flight crew, of the weather that could affect their flight, is a strong contributor to safety of flight. Both in-person and telephone based briefings have given way to a self briefing process by which crews familiarise themselves with the weather using online or printed products. Self briefing can provide an equivalent level of safety but only if the flight crew is capable of interpreting the available weather products and if they conduct their weather review in a systematic and comprehensive fashion.
