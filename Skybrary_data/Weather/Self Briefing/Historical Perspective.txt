Prior to the aviation community's almost universal access to the internet, the infrastructure at virtually all international (and most regional) airports included the provision of a professionally staffed weather services office. These offices were often co-located with Airport Operations or included as part of a Flight Service Station (FSS) and were staffed by professional observers, briefers and, in some locations, meteorologists. As a matter of routine, most military, corporate and general aviation (GA) pilots (and, in some cases, air navigators) would attend the weather office, as part of their preflight or transit stop routine. There, they would acquire the most current weather information and be professionally briefed on the weather phenonmena that they might encounter along their route of flight. During the same era, most airlines had an operations office at each major hub and their pilots would receive their weather briefing from professional dispatchers as part of the preflight protocol. Over time, automation advances and budgetary constraints reduced the availability these facilities, and the associated professional staff, as they were consolidated into regional offices. However, pilots could still use the telephone to call the appropriate regional office to obtain a full weather briefing. With the advent of online flight plan filing and provision of weather information services, fewer and fewer pilots made use of the services of a weather office when obtaining their preflight briefing, instead downloading the information from online sources or by being forwarded the flight "package" from airline dispatch or a third-party provider, and then self briefing. Whilst self briefing can provide an equivalent level of safety, if not done properly it can leave the fight crew without an adequate understanding of the weather phenomena that could affect their flight.
