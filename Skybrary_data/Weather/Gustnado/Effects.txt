Turbulence. The degree of turbulence experienced by an aircraft encountering a Gustnado depends on the severity of the vortex and the size of the aircraft. Generally speaking, given that most Gustnadoes are of limited intensity, large commercial jet aircraft will not experience more than rough air when encountering a Gustnado on approach. However, the consequence of encountering a Gustnado for a light aircraft may well be loss of control.. Damage to Aircraft and Airport Infrastructure. Winds of 100 kts or more have been associated with Gustnadoes and significant damage to buildings, communications infrastructure, and parked aircraft is possible..
