Encounters between aircraft and tornadoes when in flight are, given the limited extent and prevalence of tornadoes and the usual recognition and avoidance of the hazard they may represent, unsurprisingly rare. However, on 6 October 1981, a Fokker F-28-4000 being operated by NLM Cityhopper on a passenger flight from Rotterdam to Eindhoven in the Netherlands broke up in flight in severe turbulence associated with a tornado some 15nm south south east of Rotterdam and all occupants were killed. FDR data obtained at the time stated that the aircraft had encountered sudden vertical acceleration reaching 6g which had resulted in one wing being detached from the aircraft and consequent terminal loss of control.
