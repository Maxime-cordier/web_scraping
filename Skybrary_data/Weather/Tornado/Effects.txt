A Tornado can cause considerable damage to airport and air traffic control infrastructure if it touches down on an aerodrome; any aircraft caught on the ground in the path of a tornado will quite possibly be damaged beyond repair. It is difficult to imagine any aircraft surviving the experience of encountering a tornado while in flight. If an aircraft on the ground cannot be removed from an at-risk position, then damage to it and other aircraft and structures may be lessened by securing the aircraft to the ground. For information on the all the hazards associated with thunderstorms, see the main article Cumulonimbus (Cb).
