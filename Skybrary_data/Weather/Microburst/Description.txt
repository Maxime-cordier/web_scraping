As a Cumulonimbus (Cb) cloud becomes mature, strong downdrafts occur, usually associated with precipitation in the form of Rain, Hail, or Virga. These downdrafts can be very powerful, with vertical winds of 6,000 ft per minute. When a strong downdraft, referred to as a downburst or microburst, hits the surface, the wind diverts horizontally outwards. Downdrafts ahead of a cumulonimbus cloud push warm surface air upwards, a little like a cold frontal system, often creating a wall of cloud commonly referred to as a Gust Front.
