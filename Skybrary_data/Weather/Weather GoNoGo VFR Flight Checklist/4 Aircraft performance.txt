a) given temperature, altitude, density altitude, and aircraft loading, what is the expected aircraft performance on: takeoff distance,. time & distance to climb,. cruise performance,. landing distance?. b) Are these performance values sufficient for the runways to be used and the terrain to be crossed on this flight? (Note: remember that it is always good practice to add a 50% to 100% safety margin to the “book numbers” you derive from the charts in the aircraft’s flight manual). c) If icing conditions are encountered, is the pilot experienced at operating the aircraft’s deicing or anti-icing equipment? Is this equipment provided and if yes, is it in good condition and functional? For what icing conditions is the aircraft rated, if any? After all this consider the possibility that the weather may be different from forecast. Have alternative plans and be ready and willing to divert should an unexpected change occur.
