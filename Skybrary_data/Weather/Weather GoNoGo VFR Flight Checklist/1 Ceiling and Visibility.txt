a) what are the current ceiling and visibility and how much room do I have between the reported / forecast ceilings and the terrain along my route? b) does this information suggest any need to change my planned altitude? c) if I have to fly lower to stay out of the clouds, will terrain be a factor? d) where are the cloud base and cloud top? e) are the reported and forecast ceilings above my personal minima? (Note: personal minima for a typical 50-100 hour/year private pilot should be at least basic 3000 feet for daytime flight, raised to 4000 feet for night flight in non-mountainous terrain and at least 5000 feet for Visual Flight Rules (VFR) night flight in mountainous terrain). f) what visibility can I expect for each phase of flight (departure, enroute, destination)? g) are there conditions that could reduce visibility during the planned flight? (Hint: look for indications such as a small and/or decreasing temperature/dew point spread).
