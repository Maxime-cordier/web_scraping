Operators of small twin jets with narrow fuselages and aft fuselage mounted engines should review their operating procedures to ensure that: Where an Auxiliary Power Unit is available, it is started when approaching an area where the potential for lightning strikes exists. Then, in the unlikely event of a double engine failure the aircraft will maintain power and hydraulics whilst a rapid engine relight is attempted. [Editor's note: The operating limitations of the APU (i.e. max altitude) may preclude the running of the APU as a precautionary measure. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the APU will itself flame-out as a result of aero-thermal effects.]. Pilots review the dual engine flameout memory items as a "best practice" when encountering areas of lightning activity..
