Local winds may result from a variety of causes, e.g. orographic wind, katabatic wind, anabatic wind, sea breezes and land breezes, etc. Due to the warming of air during the day and the cooling at night, wind direction and strength changes between day and night. Typically, the wind increases in strength and veers by day, and reduces in strength and backs at night. This phenomenon, known as diurnal variation, is particularly marked in sea and land breezes. Strong up and down-drafts within cumulonimbus clouds give rise to extremely local gusts, which may be of high speed and rapidly changing direction. Microbursts are extreme examples of this. In tropical areas, very low pressure areas can develop over the sea giving rise to tropical revolving storms, which feature extremely powerful winds. At high altitude, the jet stream is often encountered above a frontal system where cold and warm air masses meet.
