Strong cross winds may pose a hazard on landing and take off, especially in gusty conditions; most aircraft types have a cross-wind component limit listed in their Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) or Operations Manual. Strong winds may cause turbulence, for example, at low altitude where the wind is blowing over hilly terrain. Turbulence may also occur in clear air, for example severe clear air turbulence is frequently associated with jet streams. Violent up and down-drafts caused by thunderstorms cause the local wind strength and direction to change rapidly giving rise to wind shear, which can pose a serious safety hazard close to an airfield. The hazards associated with tropical revolving storms, tornadoes, waterspouts and dust or sand storms are self-evident.
