Wind is the term used to describe the large-scale flow of atmospheric air. In global terms, the main cause of wind is the difference in air pressure between two regions within the atmosphere. Initially, wind flows from high to low pressure, but as the wind speed increases, the rotation of the earth takes effect, causing the wind to travel along the direction of the isobars.
