Wind direction is conventionally reported in written forecasts, Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) or weather broadcasts using three figures, rounded to the nearest 10° true; this is followed by the wind speed in kilometres per hour or knots. For example, a wind from a direction of 273° true, strength 18 knots would be reported as 270/18 kt. The surface wind reported by the air traffic controller to a pilot follows the same convention, except that magnetic direction is used instead of true. Significant changes to forecast or actual wind speed and direction are also reported. For details, see separate article Wind Velocity Reporting
