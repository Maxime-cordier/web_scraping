PSCs are classified into Types I and II according to their chemical composition, which can be measured using LIDAR. The technique also determines the height and ambient temperature of the cloud. Type I clouds contain water, nitric acid and/or sulphuric acid and they are a source of polar ozone depletion. They form when temperatures drop to -78°C or lower. Type Ia clouds consist of large, aspherical particles, consisting of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT). Type Ib clouds contain small, spherical particles (non-depolarising), of a liquid supercooled ternary solution (STS) of sulphuric acid, nitric acid and water. Type Ic clouds consist of metastable water-rich nitric acid in a solid phase.. Type Ia clouds consist of large, aspherical particles, consisting of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT).. Type Ib clouds contain small, spherical particles (non-depolarising), of a liquid supercooled ternary solution (STS) of sulphuric acid, nitric acid and water.. Type Ic clouds consist of metastable water-rich nitric acid in a solid phase.. Type II clouds, which are very rarely observed in the Arctic, consist of water ice only. They need temperatures of -83°C or lower to form.. Only Type II clouds are necessarily nacreous whereas Type I clouds can be iridescent under certain conditions, just as any other cloud.
