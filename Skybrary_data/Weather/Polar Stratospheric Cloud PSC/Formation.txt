PSCs form at temperatures of around -85°C, colder than average lower stratosphere temperatures, and are comprised of ice particles ~10µm across. The clouds must be composed of similar sized crystals to produce the characteristic bright iridescent colours by diffraction and interference. PSCs form at very high altitudes, between 15 and 25 km (about 50,000 to 80,000 feet). Only at very low temperatures is there enough condensation to produce clouds in the extremely dry air at these altitudes. Sometimes in winter near the North or South Pole, temperatures in the lower stratosphere get lower enough for PSCs to form. One theory suggests that strong winds in the troposphere can induce mountain waves when orographic features are encountered. These waves may propogate upward into the stratosphere where the lifting and cooling produced can generate PSCs. PSCs are more common near the South Pole, which is typically colder, but recently PSCs have been observed near the North Pole.
