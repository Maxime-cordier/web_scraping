PSCs were long regarded as curiosities and of no real consequence. However, Type I clouds are now known as sites of harmful destruction of stratospheric ozone over the Antarctic and Arctic. Their surfaces act as catalysts that convert more benign forms of human-made chlorine into active free radicals (for example ClO, chlorine monoxide). During the return of spring sunlight these radicals destroy many ozone molecules in a series of chain reactions. Cloud formation is doubly harmful because it also removes from the stratosphere gaseous nitric acid that would otherwise combine with ClO to form less reactive forms of chlorine.
