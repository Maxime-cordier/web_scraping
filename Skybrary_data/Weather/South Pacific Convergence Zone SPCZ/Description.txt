The South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) is a persistent band of cloudiness and storms, a 200-400 km broad zone that originates in Southeast Asia and stretches southeast to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands. The SPCZ is the Southern Hemisphere’s most expansive and persistent rain band, and is the largest and most persistent spur of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). It is also the only spur that does not result from heating over land during the summer. The SPCZ is most active in the southern hemisphere summer, but it is present year-round. The SPCZ can affect the precipitation on Polynesian islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean, so it is important to understand how the SPCZ behaves with large-scale, global climate phenomenon, such as the ITCZ, El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and the Interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO), a portion of the Pacific decadal oscillation. Rainfall varies greatly by season in the Central South Pacific sub-region: approximately 75% of annual rainfall occurs from November to April, when the SPCZ is located about halfway between Western Samoa and Fiji. During the dry season, the SPCZ moves out of the area, and often becomes weak or inactive
