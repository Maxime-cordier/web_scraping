It is believed that the SPCZ is composed of two parts. The equatorward section contains tropical convection due to convergence in the wind field where the southeast trades from transitory anticyclones to the south meet with the semi-permanent easterly flow from the eastern South Pacific anticyclone. The poleward part which extends into the subtropics is believed to be generated by mid-latitude systems which migrate and eventually dissipate here. The SPCZ exists in summer and winter but can change its orientation and location. It is often distinct from the ITCZ, which is over Australia in teh summer, but at times they become one continuous zone of convergence. The location of the SPCZ is affected by ENSO and Interdecadal Pacific oscillation conditions. It generally stretches from the Solomon Islands through Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. Thunderstorm activity, or convection, within the band is dependent upon the season, as the more equatorward portion is most active in the Southern Hemisphere summer, and the more poleward portion is most active during transition seasons of fall and spring. The convergence zone shifts east or west depending on the existence of El Ni√±o, or the phase of ENSO. The SPCZ is fuelled by moisture from the west pacific warm pool (also referred to as the warm western Pacific basin), and is most active from October to April (during the Southern Hemisphere summer) due to propagated monsoon activity from India.
