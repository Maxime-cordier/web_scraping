A Low Level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS) is a ground-based system used to detect wind shear and associated weather phenomena, such as microbursts, close to an airport; especially along the runway corridors. This information can then be passed, in real-time, to warn pilots and aerodrome services. Low Level Wind Shear is defined as a sudden change of wind velocity and/or direction in either the vertical or horizontal planes. At low level, i.e. when aircraft are departing from or landing at an aerodrome, wind shear can present a severe risk to flight safety. Therefore, timely warnings are essential to help pilots respond appropriately.
