The tropopause is the upper limit of the troposphere and therefore constitutes the boundary between it and the Stratosphere. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, the "first tropopause" is conventionally defined as the lowest level at which the lapse rate decreases to 2°C/km or less, provided also that the average lapse rate between this level and all higher levels within 2 km does not exceed 2°C/km. If the average lapse rate above this "first tropopause" between any level and all higher levels within 1 km exceeds 3°C/km, then a "second tropopause" is defined by the same criterion as the first. This second tropopause may be either within or above the 1 km layer. Near the mid-latitudes there may be two layers of tropopauses: polar and tropical. For aviation purposes, however, significant weather charts generally show one tropopause, using the average heights of the two tropopauses to denote its height in flight level. Due to the changes in tropopause heights, especially in mid-latitude polar frontal systems, in certain cases stratospheric air may be brought into the warm air troposphere as a result of the lower tropopause height over the cold air and the jetstream associated with polar frontal system. The airflow effect may “draw” stratospheric air from above and enter the warm air troposphere by way of the jet stream.
