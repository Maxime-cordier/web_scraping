The tropopause occurs at approximately 20,000 feet over the poles and at approximately 60,000 feet above the equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet. Due to the tropospheric effect of temperature decrease with height, in general the temperature at the Tropopause is lower equatorward and higher poleward. The location of the tropopause is of interest to flight crew because it indicates the altitude at which temperature becomes constant with increasing altitude, which is an import factor in performance and fuel calculations. It also gives an indication of the location of jet streams and the high winds and turbulence associated with them. In general, clouds and weather occur below the tropopause in the troposphere; however, deep tropical convective systems can break through the tropopause, especially over land. Overshooting cumulonimbus tops are examples of such situations. The turbulence felt as a result of jet streams and other weather phenomena doesn't necessarily end at the tropopause. Turbulence can continue well above the tropopause, however the general rule to climb or descend to avoid turbulence most effectively (as opposed to horizontally by directional changes) still applies.
