Thunderstorm activity is often greatest in the late afternoon/evening when downdrafts can be severe with risk of flooding and aquaplaning on runways. Although total overcast conditions are rare, cumulus clouds are typically present with maximum coverage over land in the late afternoon/evening. Fog frequently occurs with the high humidities.
