Visibility is an important factor in all phases of flight, but especially when the aircraft is manoeuvring on or close to the ground, i.e. during taxi-out, take-off and initial climb, approach and landing, and taxi-in. Aircraft departure and arrival is limited by the visibility (or RVR) to an extent that depends on the sophistication of ground equipment, the technical equipment fitted to the aircraft and the qualification of the flight crew. Many aerodromes and aircraft are fitted with equipment that makes possible a landing in very low visibility conditions provided the flight crew are suitably qualified; however, in very low visibility, it may prove impossible for the pilot to navigate the aircraft along the runway and taxiways to the aircraft stand.
