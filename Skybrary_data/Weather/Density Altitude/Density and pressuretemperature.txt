The Ideal Gas Law for dry air: pV = RT where: p = air pressure (hPa) (kg m-1 s-2) V = air volume (m3) R = universal gas constant for dry air (287 J kg-1 K-1) T = air temperature (K) For atmospheric applications, however, volume is not well defined, and since density is mass per volume, using atmospheric mass and volume, the Gas Law can be reformulated: p = ρRT where ρ = air density Therefore ρ = p R-1 T-1 Density is directly proportional to pressure and indirectly proportional to temperature. As pressure increases, with temperature constant, density increases. Conversely when temperature increases, with pressure constant, density decreases. Air density will decrease by about 1% for a decrease of 10 hPa in pressure or 3 °C increase in temperature. A decrease in density results in an increased density altitude, whereas an increase in density results in a decreased density altitude. Considering the notion that the aircraft performs on the basis of density altitude, at higher elevations with high temperatures the aircraft performance is greatly reduced compared to its relative performance at that level with standard temperatures. Conversely, at lower altitudes with colder temperatures aircraft performance is greatly increased compared to its relative performance at that level with standard temperatures. The density of air decreases more rapidly with height in warm air than in cold air. The commonly accepted value for density altitude decrease with height is 120 ft °C-1, and in some publications, articles may even be simplified to 100 ft °C-1.
