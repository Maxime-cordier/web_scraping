"The Sting Jet is defined as a coherent airflow that descends from mid‐levels inside the cloud head into the frontal‐fracture region of a Shapiro-Keyser cyclone over a period of a few hours leading to a distinct region of near‐surface stronger winds. It lies above the Cold Conveyor Belt (CCB) during some stage of its life, but, at least in some cases, descends to reach the top of the boundary layer ahead of the CCB. Strong near‐surface wind speeds and gusts may or may not result from a Sting Jet depending on boundary‐layer processes. It is not attributed to a specific mechanism in this definition. Sting Jets do not, in all cases, accelerate beyond the tip of the CCB, so may not always form a distinct peak in speed at the surface, though it seems likely that, in this case, the SJ may still enhance the impact of the CCB."[1]
