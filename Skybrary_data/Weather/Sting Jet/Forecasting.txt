Sting Jets are difficult to forecast because of their relatively small size, and the way each individual low-pressure system develops. However, there are tell-tale signs in weather models that are now able to spot cores of very strong winds. It is also possible to spot the Sting Jet developing on satellite images, as the end of the cold conveyor is marked by a hook-shaped cloud with a point at the end. There are also types of satellite images that show the amount of water vapour, made up of light and dark shades. The darker the shade the less water vapour there is. Around the sting jet there are often dark fingers of air stretching out, indicating sinking air that can bring strong winds down to the surface.
