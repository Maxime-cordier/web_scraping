Weather observation data is mostly used for the following purposes: METAR reports are provided at regular intervals (usually 30 minutes) and provide essential weather information about an aerodrome. Data should be representative for the whole aerodrome operating area.. Special reports (SPECI) are be produced as dictated by the weather conditions (when there is significant deterioration or improvement in airport weather conditions, such as significant changes of surface winds, visibility, cloud base height and occurrence of severe weather). The criteria for the production of a special report and information dissemination are laid down in relevant local documents. The format of the SPECI report is similar to that of the METAR and the elements used have the same meaning. The identifier METAR or SPECI at the beginning of the weather report differentiates them.. TAF (terminal area forecast) - the aerodrome forecast consists of a concise statement of the expected meteorological conditions at an aerodrome for a specified period.. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) - is a continuous broadcast of recorded non-ATC aeronautical information.. VOLMET - a worldwide network of radio stations that broadcast TAF, SIGMET and METAR reports.. Weather reports to ATS. Weather reports to Air Traffic Services are usually issued half-hourly and are used by the ATS unit to provide weather information to operators, aerodrome users and pilots at or in the vicinity of the aerodrome. Whilst these reports are very similar to the METAR, there are slight differences in content and coding..
