These south-easterly winds can reach 45 knots and persist for several days, pushing upstream surface water at the exit of RÃ­o de la Plata. For a speed of 35 knots, the river level increases by one meter. If the phenomenon continues for several days, or if the winds are stronger, the surge can reach more than 4 meters. Rising waters then cause flooding.
