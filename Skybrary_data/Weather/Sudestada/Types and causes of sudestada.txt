A sudestada may take place with or (less commonly) without precipitation. A sudestada with rain is generated by the combined effect of two systems: a high pressure system located on the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of central Patagonia, which via is counterclockwise circulation brings cold sea air to the east of Buenos Aires Province and the south of the Argentine littoral and Uruguay, and a clockwise rotating low pressure system, located over the center-south of Argentine Mesopotamia and western Uruguay, that brings hot, humid air to the same region. As the pressure in the latter system drops, winds from the southeast increase accompanied by persistent rain and drizzle, low cloud and occasionally thunderstorms. As the depression moves east into the Atlantic Ocean, the winds turn to the south west and become drier. Sudestadas typically last one to three days. A dry sudestada is caused by a high pressure system, centered on the southwest of Buenos Aires Province in Argentina, bringing persistent dry winds to the mouth of the RÃ­o de la Plata. This usually occurs after the passage of a cold front.
