During the rainy season, heavy rains can cause disruption to infrastructure and airport emergency services. Thunderstorms can be accompanied by severe downdrafts and heavy rain causing flooding on airport surfaces and the risk of aquaplaning on runways. Strong thunderstorms and high winds are more common with the onset of the monsoon rains. Cumulus clouds are common in the rainy season. Much less cloud cover occurs in the drier months.
