The helicopter-triggered lightning strike phenomenon has been found to occur during operations over the North Sea between November and early April when there is usually little or no natural lightning activity in progress at the time. Over the past 20 years it appears that there have been 1-2 of these strikes each winter. It has also been considered significant that no strikes have been recorded to North Sea helicopters in summer months when the level of natural lightning activity is significantly greater than during the winter months. Although this phenomenon has occasionally been reported quite widely, the only other known area of relatively frequent occurrence is the Sea of Japan, also in winter. This area is geographically similar to the North Sea since both areas experience convective instability attributable to advection as dry polar air passes over a warmer sea surface. However, in the case of the Sea of Japan, the difference between the sea and air temperature is often 6 ÂºC or more and vigorous convection can result. North Sea temperature differences tend to be much less, leading to much weaker convective activity. Whilst visual avoidance of convective cloud is often possible in summer, relatively small winter Cb cloud over the North Sea in winter can be embedded in Sc layer cloud and consequently difficult to see.
