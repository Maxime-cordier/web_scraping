The Thermosphere is characterised by rising temperature with height - temperatures rising to 1000Â°C. The boundary between the Mesosphere and the Thermosphere is known as the Mesopause. The lower part of the Thermosphere, a layer of ionised air extending from the Mesopause to approximately 600km is also known as the Ionosphere, while the upper part of the Thermosphere is also known as the Exosphere.
