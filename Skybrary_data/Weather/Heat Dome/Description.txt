A heat dome is a mass of abnormally warm air that extends from the surface to well into the atmosphere. It is associated with high pressure both at the surface and aloft. Heat domes develop when the atmosphere traps hot air, as if bounded by a lid or cap. The upper air weather patterns are slow to move, referred to by meteorologists as an Omega block.
