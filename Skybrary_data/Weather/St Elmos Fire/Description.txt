A visible luminous electrical discharge observed around parts of an aircraft when the electrical charge on the aircraft becomes sufficiently intense. Similar in nature to the glow from a neon tube, and often observed as brushlike fiery jets extending from the tip of an aerial, a wing, propeller, windscreen or other part of an aircraft.
