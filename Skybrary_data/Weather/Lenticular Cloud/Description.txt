Lenticular clouds are stationary lens-shaped clouds that form in the troposphere, normally in perpendicular alignment to the wind direction. There are three types of lenticular clouds: altocumulus standing lenticular (ACSL),. stratocumulus standing lenticular (SCSL), and. cirrocumulus standing lenticular (CCSL).
