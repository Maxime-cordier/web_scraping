This article provides guidance for controllers on what to expect of an aircraft experiencing problems associated with volcanic ash and some of the considerations which will enable the controller to provide as much support as possible to the aircraft concerned. An aircraft encountering volcanic ash may experience engine problems; in some cases, aircraft have lost all engines as a result of ash ingestion and the subsequent formation of deposits on critical engine surfaces from the burning, melting and re-solidification of particles from the ash cloud.
