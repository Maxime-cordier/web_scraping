U.K. CAA recommends that all aerodromes certificated under the European Aviation Safety Agency’s Common Requirements (EC REG 1035/2011) as an Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) “be required to ensure that [the aerodrome meteorological observing] unit’s quality management system includes an appropriate level of detail of the meteorological processes which are applicable to the provision of meteorological services.” Quality management systems are reinforced by the U.K. Meteorological Authority conducting regulatory oversight audits of aerodrome meteorological observing units. The agency’s Meteorological Forecast Office monitors the quality of METAR reports and assists these aerodrome units in resolving audit findings. Another U.K. countermeasure is that aerodrome meteorological observing service providers ensure that all accredited aerodrome Met observers maintain their observing competence, according to CAP 746. The publication also states: “Following changes to observing practices or aeronautical codes, the aerodrome meteorological observing service provider shall ensure that all staff are aware of the changes, additional training arranged as necessary and that the changes are implemented accordingly.”
