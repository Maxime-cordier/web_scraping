As in other aspects of aviation, tension exists between the high reliance on automation for Met observations and the infrequent situations in which immediate human intervention becomes necessary. Moreover, today’s automation often is mandatory, i.e., the operational norm. CAP 746 states, as an example, “At aerodromes with runways intended for Category II and III instrument approach and landing operations, automated equipment for measuring and for monitoring surface wind, visibility, runway visual range, height of cloud base, air and dew-point temperatures and atmospheric pressure shall be installed. “These systems enable all the Met sensor data to be acquired, measured, processed and made available for subsequent display and use in other systems in real time. Typically, measurements of wind, pressure, runway visual range, air and dew-point temperature are used directly with the ability for the human observer to modify or accept the cloud height and amount, visibility and present weather reports.” Automated sensors, however, have inherent limitations, especially in spatial coverage of the sensor and in effectiveness of sensor systems for resolving types of present weather. CAP 746 states: “To comply with internationally agreed practices, the [U.K.] Met Authority requires the reporting of prevailing visibility, lowest visibility (if certain criteria are met), present weather phenomena such as thunderstorms, snow, freezing precipitation (including hail and freezing rain), towering cumulus and cumulonimbus cloud. “However, the current automatic observing systems in use in the U.K. are either incapable of reporting these elements or do not have an appropriate high degree of accuracy and consistency. It is for this reason that measurements of horizontal visibility, present weather and cloud must be validated by an accredited observer before being issued as a METAR.”
