Operations in low temperatures bring numerous challenges. Although there is little precipitation, airframe icing is still a threat. Pay careful attention to Altimeter Temperature Error and beware of optical illusions when flying VFR in an ice cap/ice sheet environment. Tundra regions close to open water are frequently affected by advection fog
