Surface pressure charts show the surface pressure pattern using isobars (lines of equal pressure) and indicate areas of high (H) and low pressure (L) along with their central pressure value at a "synoptic" scale, that is to say at a large scale which shows migratory pressure systems and related fronts on a single chart.
