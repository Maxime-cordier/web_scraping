Rossby waves, also known as planetary waves, are a type of inertial wave naturally occurring in rotating fluids. They were first identified by Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby. They are observed in the atmospheres and oceans of planets owing to the rotation of the planet. This article focuses on atmospheric Rossby waves on Earth, giant meanders in high-altitude winds that have a major influence on weather. These waves are associated with pressure systems and the jet stream.
