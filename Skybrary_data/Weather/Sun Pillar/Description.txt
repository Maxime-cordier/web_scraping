A light pillar is an atmospheric optical phenomena in which a vertical beam of light appears o extend above and/or below the light source. The effect is created by the reflection of light from tiny ice crystals that are suspended in the atmosphere or that comprise high altitude clouds such as cirrostratus or cirrus. If the light comes from the Sun (usually when it is near or even below the horizon), the phenomenon is called a sun pillar or solar pillar. Light pillars can also be caused by the Moon or terrestrial sources such as street lights or erupting volcanoes.
