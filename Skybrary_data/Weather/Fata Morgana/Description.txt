A Fata Morgana is a type of mirage. A mirage is an image caused by atmospheric refraction. Refraction refers to the bending of, in this case, light waves as they move through mediums of different density, typically layers of air with different temperatures. In particular, a Fata Morgana is a superior mirage.
