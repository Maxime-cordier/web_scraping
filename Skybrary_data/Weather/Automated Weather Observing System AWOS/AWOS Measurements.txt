Depending on the configuration, AWOS measure a combination of the following parameters: Barometric pressure (in hectopascals (hPa) / inches of Mercury (inHg)), altimeter setting and density altitude. Wind speed and wind gusts (in knots), wind direction (from which the wind is blowing) and variable wind direction (in degrees of the compass). Temperature and dew point (in degrees Celsius). Visibility and variable visibility (in metres/miles). Sky condition (in oktas), cloud ceiling height (in metres/feet) and liquid precipitation accumulation (in centimetres/inches). Precipitation type (e.g. rain, snow, drizzle) identification. Thunderstorm detection (via a cloud-to-ground lightning detector). Freezing rain detection (via a freezing rain sensor). Runway surface conditions.. Non-certified sensors may be attached to AWOS systems, but weather data derived from those sensors must be clearly identified as "advisory" in any voice messages and may not be included in any METAR observations.
