Zonda wind is a regional term for the warm and dry f√∂hn wind that often occurs on the eastern slope of the Andes, in Argentina. Fohn winds are downsloping winds that become warm and very dry due to adiabatic compression because of the higher pressure at lower elevations. The compression also tends to accelerate the winds. Separately, zonda is also used to describe a hot, humid north wind in the Pampas of South America.
