The 2009 European Cold Wave gave most of Europe, especially central and southern areas, very cold temperatures. Some places such as Germany, France, Italy, Romania and Spain had record cold temperatures well below 0 °C (32 °F). Most of these places were also covered in snow and ice which caused many airport delays. The 2012 European Cold Wave was a noteworthy temperature anomaly that started in January 2012 and brought snow and freezing temperatures to much of the European continent. Particularly low temperatures hit several Eastern and Northern European countries, reaching as low as −39.2 °C in Finland. The heaviest snow was recorded in the Balkan region. In February the snow reached the British Isles, causing interruptions at London Heathrow Airport where up to 10 cm (3.9 in) of snow impeded many scheduled flights.
