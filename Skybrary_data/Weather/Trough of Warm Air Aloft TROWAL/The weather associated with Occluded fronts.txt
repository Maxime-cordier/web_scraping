A term favoured by Canadian forecasters during winter weather, TROWAL is used to describe a "tongue" of relatively warm/moist air aloft that wraps around to the north and west of a mature cyclone. Areas of intense lift and frontogenesis are commonly associated with TROWALs, and they are favoured regions for heavy and/or prolonged precipitation. During a winter storm, the heaviest snowfall amounts frequently occur along and north of the TROWAL axis.
