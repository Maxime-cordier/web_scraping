Areas of thunderstorm activity may reinforce pre-existing frontal zones and can 'outrun' cold fronts. This outrunning occurs within the upper level westerly airflow where the upper level jet splits into two streams. The resultant mesoscale convective system (MCS) forms at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern in the area of best low level inflow. The convection then moves east and toward the equator into the warm sector, parallel to low-level thickness lines. When the convection is strong and linear or curved, the MCS may be described as a squall line, with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise. If squall lines form over arid regions, a duststorm known as a haboob may result from the high winds in their wake, picking up dust from the desert floor.
