Debris balls can be a result of anthropogenic (from human activity) or biomass (plant) debris and are more likely to occur if a tornado crosses an environment such as a forest or populated area. As a result of the strong winds required to damage structures and loft debris into the air, debris balls are normally the result of EF3 or stronger tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Weaker tornadoes may also not cause debris balls due to their mostly short-lived nature and thus any debris may not be sampled by radar. However, not all tornadoes meeting such strength requirements exhibit debris balls, depending on their vicinity to sources of debris and distance from the radar site. Debris balls are seen on radar reflectivity images as a small, roundish area of high reflectivity values.
