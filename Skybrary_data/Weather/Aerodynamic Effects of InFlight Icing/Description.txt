The aerodynamic effects of accreted ice on the continued safe flight of an aircraft are a complex subject because of the many forms that such ice accretion can take. In certain circumstances, very little surface roughness is required to generate significant aerodynamic effects; as ice-load accumulates, there is often no aerodynamic warning of a departure from normal performance. Stall warning systems are designed to operate in relation to the angle of attack of a clean aeroplane and cannot be relied upon to activate usefully in the case of an ice-loaded airframe. This subject is given a comprehensive treatment in an article originally published by Transport Canada and listed below under 'Further Reading'. That article examines the way in which the crucial balance between lift and drag is affected by ice and considers how ice protection systems work. This SKYbrary article provides a summary of the main points.
