The Pacific Warm Pool (PWP) is characterised by a mean sea surface temperature (SST) exceeding 28 deg C (the minimum surface water temperature that supports deep convection), weak trade winds, and the resultant deep convection, with thunderstorm tops exceeding 15 km. This body of water, which spans the western waters of the equatorial Pacific, holds the warmest seawaters in the world. Because this area of warm water pushes west into the Indian Ocean, it is also often referred to as the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool. Scientists found that, over a period of roughly two decades, the warm poolâ€™s average annual temperatures and dimensions (the area enclosed within the 28 deg C isotherm) increase and then decrease like a slowly pulsating beacon.
