The wavelength and amplitude of the oscillations depends on many factors including the height of the high ground relative to surrounding terrain, the wind speed and the instability of the atmosphere. Formation of Mountain Waves can occur in the following conditions: Wind direction within 30 degrees of the perpendicular to the ridge of high ground and no change in direction over a significant height band.. Wind speeds at the crest of the ridge in excess of 15 kts, increasing with height.. A temperature inversion just above the hill or mountain barrier.. Vertical currents within the oscillations can reach 2,000 ft/min. The combination of these strong vertical currents and surface friction may cause rotors[1] to form beneath the mountain waves causing severe turbulence.
