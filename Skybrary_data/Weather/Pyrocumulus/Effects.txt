Severe Turbulence can be expected in a pyrocumulous cloud and the cloud may contain ash from the fire or volcano. The presence of a volcanic pyrocumulous cloud may indicate the presence of a volcanic ash cloud in the area. Rain and microbursts/downbursts, icing, may also occur within the pyrocumulus cloud, along with the associated severe turbulence.
