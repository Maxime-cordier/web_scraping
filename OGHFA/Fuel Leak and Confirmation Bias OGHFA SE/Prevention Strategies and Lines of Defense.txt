Although the pilots were all experienced they did not identify the imbalance as a fuel leak, likely for the following reasons: None of them had ever experienced such a large fuel leak. There was no information in operations and training manuals on the symptoms of tank imbalance. Current training did not provide this knowledge.. Few resources were available to crews to aid in the quick identification of fuel leaks. There was very limited training for positive recognition and correct identification of such a failure. Improve crew fuel system knowledge and training on identifying fuel leaks as well as awareness of the associated risks. Specifically related to this incident, the crew needed to ask important questions before taking any action to balance the fuel tanks. What was the reason behind the imbalance and how long would the rebalancing take? The cause needed to be clearly understood, and tank rebalancing monitored constantly. Fuel-tank balancing is a significant operation. It must be clearly understood before acting. For the sake of completeness, and aside from actions in human factors, the airline and the manufacturer have taken steps to improve procedures since the incident: The QRH was amended the day after the incident to include a warning concerning fuel leaks. Explicit fuel imbalance procedures, including the monitoring of balancing action, were introduced. Exercises concerning fuel leaks were added to training. Maintenance procedures on the engine were amended to warn mechanics of the torque limitations for filter cover bolts.. The high-pressure pump fuel filter cover fasteners on the airlineâ€™s entire fleet were inspected. It resulted in 17 percent of parts being changed..
