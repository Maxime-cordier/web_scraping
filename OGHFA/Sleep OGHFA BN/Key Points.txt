Sleep is an active physiological process that includes five stages, N1-N4 and REM. Stages N3 and N4 are most important in recovering from fatigue. Dreams are more vivid during REM sleep. More slow-wave sleep occurs in the first part of the night and more REM sleep in the second part. Two components control the time of sleep: The homeostatic component is based on wakefulness. The longer a person stays awake, the greater the tendency to fall asleep The circadian rhythm, or biological clock, limits the ability to sleep at unusual times. How long a person stays asleep depends on when in the circadian cycle the individual falls asleep. The homeostatic component is based on wakefulness.

Temporary sleep disorders (1 to 6 nights) often result from stress, environmental factors or circadian factors. Long-term sleep problems (3 or more weeks) result from sleep disorders and bad sleep habits. Regardless of the source of sleep problems, sleepiness on the flight deck is a significant safety risk..
