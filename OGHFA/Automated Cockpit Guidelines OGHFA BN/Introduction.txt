This briefing note discusses how to improve training for interfacing with automation. It is important for every pilot to understand automation in modern glass-cockpit aircraft and how to interface with it. Understanding automation is an essential personal quality that can influence safety; each of its elements is vital to safe and efficient flying. Optimum use of automation requires the integrated and coordinated use of the following systems: Autopilot/flight director (AP/FD). Autothrottle/autothrust (A/THR). Flight management system (FMS). Higher levels of automation provide flight crews with an increasing number of options and strategies to choose for the task to be accomplished â€” for example, complying with air traffic control (ATC) requirements. The applicable flight crew operating manual (FCOM) or aircraft operating manual (AOM) provides specific information and operational recommendations for each aircraft type.
