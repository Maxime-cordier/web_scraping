Optimum use of automation requires the following: Understanding the integration and pairing of AP/FD and A/THR modes. Understanding all mode transition and reversion sequences. Understanding pilot-system interfaces for: Pilot-to-system communication for mode engagement and target selections System-to-pilot feedback for mode and target cross-check. Pilot-to-system communication for mode engagement and target selections. System-to-pilot feedback for mode and target cross-check. Being aware of available guidance (AP/FD and A/THR status, modes armed or engaged, active targets). Being alert to adapt the level of automation to the task and circumstances, or to revert to hand flying and manual thrust control, if required. Adhering to aircraft design and operating philosophies, SOPs and operations golden rules.
