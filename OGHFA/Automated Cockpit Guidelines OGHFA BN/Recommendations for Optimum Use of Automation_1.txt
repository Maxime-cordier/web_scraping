Correct use of automated systems reduces workload and significantly increases the time and resources available to the flight crew for responding to: During line operations, the AP and A/THR should be engaged, especially in marginal weather conditions or when operating into an unfamiliar airport. When operating in good weather and at low-traffic airports, the flight crew can elect to fly the departure or arrival manually to maintain manual flying skills. Using AP and A/THR enables the flight crew to pay more attention to ATC communications and to other aircraft, particularly in congested terminal areas and at high-traffic airports. Conditions permitting, the AP and A/THR should be used to fly unplanned maneuvers, such as a missed approach, to reduce workload. FMS lateral navigation should be used to reduce workload and the risk of controlled flight into terrain (Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT)) during go-around only if: The safe and efficient use and management of AP, A/THR and FMS are based on the following three-step technique: The optimum use of automation enables the flight crew to stay ahead of the aircraft and be prepared for possible contingencies. Before engaging the AP, make sure that: Engaging the AP while large commands are required to achieve the intended flight path may result in the AP overshooting the intended vertical or lateral target, and may surprise the pilot due to the resulting large pitch and roll changes and thrust variations. When interfacing with automation for selecting and arming modes and for guidance target entries, adhere to the following rules of use (rules derived from the lessons-learned from the operational and human factors analysis of operational events): During descent, ensure that the selected altitude is not below the Minimum En-route Altitude or Minimum Sector Altitude and be aware of the applicable minimum vectoring altitude During final approach, set the go-around altitude; the minimum descent altitude/height (Minimum Descent Altitude/Height) or decision altitude/height (Decision Altitude/Height) should not be set on the flight guidance control panel An alternative arrival routing, change in runway or a circling approach can be prepared on the secondary flight plan (“SEC F-PLN” or “RTE 2,” depending on the FMS terminology) Caution is essential during descent in mountainous areas; ensure that the new track and assigned altitude are not below the sector safe altitude If you are receiving radar vectors, be aware of the sector minimum vectoring altitude If necessary, the selected heading mode can be used with reference to raw navaid data while verifying the new route or requesting confirmation from ATC Monitor the correct interception of the FMS lateral flight plan Reprogramming the FMS during a critical flight phase (e.g., in the terminal area, on final approach or go-around) is not recommended, except to activate the secondary flight plan, if prepared, or for selecting a new approach Ensuring that FMS flight plan sequences correctly with a correct “TO” waypoint is essential in readiness for re-engaging the “NAV” mode, in case of a go-around If the FMS flight plan does not sequence correctly, fly
