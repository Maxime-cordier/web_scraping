raw navaid data until workload conditions allow reprogramming a correct “TO” waypoint (as described above) If a correct “TO” waypoint cannot be restored, the “NAV” mode should not be used for the rest of the approach or for go-around Supervising automation is simply flying with your eyes, observing cockpit displays and indications to ensure that the aircraft response matches your mode selections and guidance target entries, and that the aircraft attitude, speed and trajectory match your expectations. Enhancing the supervision of automation during capture phases — and cross-checking with raw data, as applicable — enable the early detection of a false capture or of the capture of an incorrect navigation signal (e.g., ILS in maintenance mode emitting a permanent on-glideslope signal)
