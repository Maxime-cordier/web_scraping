Integrated AP-A/THR systems feature a pairing of AP pitch modes (elevator control) and A/THR modes (throttle levers/thrust control). An integrated AP-A/THR operates in the same way as a human pilot: Throughout the flight, the pilotâ€™s objective is to fly: Depending on the task to be accomplished, maintaining the airspeed is assigned either to the AP (elevator) or to the A/THR, as shown in Table 1.
