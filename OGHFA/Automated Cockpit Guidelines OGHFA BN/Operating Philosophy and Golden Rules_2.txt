of the AFS must be monitored and supervised at all times by: Checking and announcing the status of AP/FD modes and A/THR mode on the FMA (i.e., arming or engagement). Observing and announcing the result of any target setting or change on the related target symbols on the PFD and ND scales. Supervising the resulting AP/FD guidance and A/THR operation on the PFD and ND (pitch attitude and bank angle, speed and speed trend, altitude, vertical speed, heading or track). If doubt exists regarding the aircraft flight path or speed control, no attempt at reprogramming the automated systems should be made. A lower level of automation or hand flying with reference to navaid raw data should be used until time and conditions permit reprogramming the AP/FD or FMS. If the aircraft does not follow the intended flight path, check the AP and A/THR engagement status. If engaged, disconnect the AP and/or A/THR using the associated disconnect push-button to revert to hand flying with FD guidance or with raw data and to manual thrust control. If hand flying, the FD commands should be followed; otherwise, the FD bars should be cleared from the display. If AP or A/THR operation needs to be overridden following a runaway or hard-over, immediately disconnect the affected system by pressing the associated disconnect push-button. Except in emergency situations, AP and A/THR must not be overridden manually.
