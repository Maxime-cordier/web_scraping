result, there is an immediate reversal of oxygen flow from the blood to the lung within four to five seconds following the decompression. This depletes the bloodâ€™s oxygen reserve and reduces the EPT at rest by up to 50 percent. Loss of consciousness usually occurs within 10 seconds. However, loss of consciousness does not mean that breathing will stop. If a pilot puts the O2 mask on his face within the 5 seconds following the decompression, the lung pressure in O2 increases to an effective value (80 hPa) and as result, recovery from hypoxia occurs within seconds. Two operational consequences result from this phenomenon:
