barometric pressure and the needed lung pressure (196 hPa) allowing PAO2 to be kept at 80 hPa. During PPB, breathing patterns are inverted as inspiration becomes passive and easy and expiration becomes active and difficult. As a result, breathing must be consciously controlled to avoid hyperventilation. Practice is required to become accustomed to this reversed breathing pattern. The best technique for PPB is as follows:
