Hypoxia remains a concern for all individuals involved in flight safety.. Hypoxia is dangerous because it impairs cognitive and physical performance, sometimes without the flight crew realising that anything is wrong.. There is no way for physiological adaptation to hypoxia in the aeronautical environment when there is a rapid decrease in barometric and lung pressure.. Protection against hypoxia is mandatory. The main protection tool is the pressurisation of the cabin. In case of cabin pressurisation failure, supplemental oxygen is required, according to some international mandates.. Pilots must be aware of issues related to hypoxia and must be trained to wear and breathe through an O2 mask.. Above FL 400 and in case of pressurisation failure, O2 is delivered to the pilots with a positive pressure. A pilot must be trained as to the proper technique for positive pressure breathing..
