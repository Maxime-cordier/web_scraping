This section provides insight on how to recognize the typical conditions and symptoms related to vestibular illusions, courses of action to prevent them and how to mitigate the consequences of illusions already occurring. It must be remembered that both pilots can experience illusions simultaneously, thereby creating a particularly dangerous condition. Takeoff and go-around. Acceleration/deceleration in flight (e.g., sudden deployment of spoilers). Prolonged banked turns. Darkness, poor visibility or no external visual reference cues (e.g., no visible horizon). Feeling of excessive pitch (either upward or downward). Apparent contradiction between artificial horizon and pilot-perceived angle. Feeling that the aircraft is straight and level when it is in a prolonged turn. Temptation to push the nose down. Runway lights or other ground lights that appear to move during times of darkness. Understand the mechanisms causing the illusion. Anticipate when the illusion might affect you (e.g., go-around, acceleration, turn etc.). Be particularly vigilant in darkness or when the true horizon is not visible. Avoid disorientation by cross-checking primary instruments regularly. Always monitor the PFD, especially: Pitch Attitude (artificial horizon) Bank Angle (artificial horizon) Rate of climb Variation in airspeed. Pitch Attitude (artificial horizon). Bank Angle (artificial horizon). Rate of climb. Variation in airspeed. Give visual information a higher priority than vestibular information, both because the input from the eyes overrides input from the vestibular system when in conflict and because visual information from instruments is much more reliable than sensations. Be prepared to recognise and acknowledge illusions when they occur. Vestibular illusions are a normal side effect of flying and do not constitute any form of illness..
