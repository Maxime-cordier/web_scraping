as the airline’s technical department. Even though two fighter airplanes rendezvous with your airplane to assess the extent of the damage, any possible assistance is thwarted by poor communications. You are not able to confirm the nature and extent of the damage the aircraft has sustained until after you land. Because of the handling and communications difficulties, you decide to make an overweight landing instead of continuing to dump fuel. You instruct the FE to stop dumping fuel as the airplane turns onto final approach. The extension of the landing gear is delayed until the airplane is on short final. The airplane intercepts the glideslope between 500 and 600 ft. At 300 ft, you call for flaps 25. The aircraft lands and taxies safely to the gate even though the landing weight is 17 percent higher than the maximum certified value. After landing, you note that the brakes on the left side are very hot. You inform ground personnel to take precautions to protect themselves from the potential danger of an explosion of the wheels and brakes due to the overheating. The damage to the airplane is substantial — likely beyond what would be economically viable to repair. Nevertheless, the event results in no loss of life or injury.
