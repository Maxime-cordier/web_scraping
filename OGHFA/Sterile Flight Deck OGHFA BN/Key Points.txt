Clearly recall the sterile flight deck rule during the preflight briefing.. Crew are prohibited from performing non-essential activities during taxiing, take-off and landing and below 10,000 feet except during cruise.. The sterile flight deck rule should be implemented with common sense so that communications remain open among all crewmembers.. It is better to break the rule than to fail to communicate..
