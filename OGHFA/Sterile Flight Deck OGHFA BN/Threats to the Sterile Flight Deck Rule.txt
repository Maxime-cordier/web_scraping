Most of the threats to adherence with the sterile flight deck rule come from interruptions and distractions from within the flight deck, from the cabin and from the ground through radio communication. One cannot expect two individuals working long hours side by side not to speak with one another and never discuss things outside their professional fields. In fact, they are encouraged to communicate, to be efficient. Some individuals have a natural tendency to speak more than others. The other crewmembers shall enforce the sterile flight deck rule to prevent distractions. Occupants seated on flight deck jump seats are also candidates to create distractions. It must be made clear to them when to talk and when not to talk. Cabin crewmembers visiting the flight deck or calling on the interphone at the wrong moment or for the wrong reasons are the second highest source of deviation from the sterile flight deck rule. The most usual interruptions are when cabin crewmembers enter the flight deck to deliver food or to request arrival time and gate information to answer questions from passengers with connecting flights. Discussions with air traffic controllers can also generate problems associated with distraction. Chatter on personal matters and acquaintances, local weather or additional requests by air traffic control (ATC) that are not pertinent to the actual phase of flight (such as gate negotiation on company frequency on final approach) are items the flight crew are entitled to refuse. Company radio calls (even those involving maintenance issues) or public address (PA) announcements below 10,000 feet are violations of the sterile flight deck rule if they are not directly related to current flight safety.
