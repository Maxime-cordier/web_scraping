Some interruptions and distractions are subtle and potentially difficult to detect. The first priority, therefore, must be to recognize that a disruption has, in fact, occurred. Once you are aware that the normal flow of activities has been interrupted, the second priority is to re-establish situational awareness. This is accomplished through the following steps: Identify - What was I doing?. Ask - Where was I interrupted?. Decide/Act - What decision or action shall I take to get “back on track?”. When deciding on an action: Use the clear guidelines in operations golden rules - “fly, navigate, communicate and manage systems, in that order”. Plan all activities. Be willing to postpone some actions until time and conditions are more conducive. Ask for more time (e.g., from the ATC or from the other crewmember) to prevent being rushed. “Take time to make time”. Follow SOPs to verify that any postponed action(s) have been accomplished. If a disruption interrupts the course of any checklist, an explicit hold should be verbalized to mark the pause in the checklist, and an explicit command should be used for resuming the checklist..
