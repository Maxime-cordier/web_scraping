One of the most important aspects of a safe flight operation is the requirement for crewmembers to carefully monitor the aircraft's flight path and systems, as well as actively cross-check each other's actions. "Good monitoring skills are not inherent in pilots as they progress in their careers. Effective monitoring techniques must be trained and rewarded..."(May 2001, Capt. Frank Tullo, leading the development of Crew Resource Management training at Continental Airlines). Most humans aren't good at monitoring; it is a tedious activity and ripe for daydreaming. However, pilots can significantly improve monitoring skills through Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), procedures, increased emphasis and practice. It is one of the purposes of this BN.
