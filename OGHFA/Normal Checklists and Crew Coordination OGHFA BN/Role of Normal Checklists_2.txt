“Hold (stop) checklist at (item).” An explicit call such as, “Resume (continue) checklist at (item),” should be made before the checklist is resumed. Upon resuming the normal checklist after an interruption, the last completed item before the hold point should be repeated. The repetition of this single item helps prevent the inadvertent omission of the next item on the checklist when it is resumed.
