You are first officer on a transcontinental flight. Just prior to departure, the captain says he isn’t feeling fully fit but is well enough to fly. There is no problem up to and during cruise, and you start the descent early in the approach with sunrise just appearing. You are cleared through 10,000 ft, engine and wing anti-ice are turned on as the airplane enters clouds. The captain, as pilot flying (PF), selects anti-icing “on” appropriately, and the airplane is cleared for further descent, autopilot on, speed still at 250 kt. Passing through 8,000 ft, the captain asks you to go on the intercom to request that the cabin be prepared for landing. Some three minutes after completing this call, you notice the aircraft is passing the final fix on the flight management system (FMS). Following this, you propose to extend the outer marker. At that moment, ATC orders you to turn to a heading of 150 degrees. This is not acknowledged by the captain. Looking at him, you notice he is staring straight ahead as if reflecting whether the heading was appropriate. Upon asking about his intention to turn, you become aware that he has his hand on the airspeed knob. He is quick to correct after you speak about this hesitation and selects a heading of 140 degrees. You challenge this by asking whether he wanted 140 or 150 degrees. ATC then gives you a turn to 160 degrees, but the captain does not initially react, and then experiences a clear seizure. Starting to shake with his upper body going limp, his right leg goes stiff and pushes the rudder. This causes the autopilot to disconnect. You take control of the airplane. The captain puts in right aileron, which you counter to keep the wings level. He seems semi-conscious and incoherent, so you call the flight attendant for assistance. Arriving in the cockpit, the flight attendant is not able to get the captain out of his seat. You make a call to request medical assistance on board. Two doctors volunteer to help. When they enter the cockpit, the captain is bleeding profusely from biting his tongue, shaking and foaming at the mouth. He is finally removed from his seat and laid on his back on the cockpit floor. His legs are extended forward between the left side of the pedestal and the right side of his seat with his feet near the yoke. Both doctors start Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) as he stops breathing. As a result the captain regains consciousness but remains incoherent and starts kicking the yoke again with his right foot. Each time you succeed in reconnecting the autopilot, the captain kicks the yoke and disconnects it. The airplane is now between 7,000 and 6,000 ft, sometimes yawing with right banks of 15 to 20 degrees and fishtailing. You order the captain to be moved away from the yoke to stop the interference and allow you to resume use of the autopilot. You declare an
