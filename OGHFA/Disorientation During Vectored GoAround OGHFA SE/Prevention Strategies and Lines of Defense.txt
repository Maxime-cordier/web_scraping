The airline considers the airport to be one requiring specific briefing and crew qualification procedures. The local topography can indeed result in wind variations leading to strong turbulence and rapidly varying visibility and cloud conditions. The approach briefing should focus briefly and concisely on the following: Most aircraft require that the initial go-around be flown at constant speed and without any acceleration with one notch of flap retraction. The acceleration and cleanup should be done at a higher altitude. This is to ensure that a correct go-around is performed and associated procedures are followed. In general, there are no go-around procedures that require a sustained turn. Although most are standard, some go-arounds are problematic, either due to visual maneuvering or ATC intervention.
