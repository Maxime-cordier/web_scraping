Well managed, this incident did not result in any harm or in any form of airplane damage. Situational awareness was refreshed from early on in the flight. Approaching 90W, the captain noted that the oil quantity was dropping on no. 2 engine. Up to then, the captain and his first officer, who was new to the aircraft type, had been discussing diversions â€” where to find charts, what sort of approaches to select, terrain limits and approach minimums, runway lengths and airplane weights, diversion options and terrain features. This was to manage fatigue and alertness, to refresh memory with operational facts, as well as to keep attention high, adding perspective to problems and maintaining situational awareness. However, the drop in oil quantity did not abate and reached zero by 70W. Diversion became a matter of progressive decision making in case of significant further oil pressure or temperature changes. Various diversion alternatives were considered. With excellent crew resource management, the decision was taken collectively to divert at the first indication of any other problems, be it oil temperature or pressure drop or a differential with the other engine of 20 psi. This happened after it was decided to climb to FL 370 at 40W. Some 15 minutes after reaching there, no. 2 engine oil pressure started to drop, and the decision was instantly made to divert with a pan call requesting clearance to the airport 360 nm southwest. Multiple operational conditions contributed to keep time pressure and stress in check: Simple prevention strategies and lines of defense discussed below were followed to maintain good situational awareness, make good decisions and follow standard operating procedures (SOPs).
