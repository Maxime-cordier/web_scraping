Safe piloting requires a fully capable individual. No level of impairment is acceptable.. Almost all drugs, whether OTC or prescribed, can impair one or more aspects of flying skills.. Your personal doctor knows your overall health but may not be familiar with the demands of flight. Always crosscheck any prescribed medicines with your flight surgeon.. Alcohol is a drug that can be dangerous to flight even after it is out of your system.. Caffeine can be useful if its intake is properly managed.. Illicit drug use is not compatible with safe flight, your health or your career goals.. Good nutrition can improve your alertness and performance. Eat right and at the correct times.. Exercise, if properly timed, promotes better piloting performance and good health.. Do not fall prey to popular myths about drug use.. Before flying, assess your fitness by remembering to go through the Iâ€™m Safe checklist (Illness, Medication, Stress. Alcohol, Fatigue, Eating)..
