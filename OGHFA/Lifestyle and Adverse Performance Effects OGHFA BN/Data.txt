There are few statistics on the effect of lifestyle on flight safety, but it is universally acknowledged that an impaired pilot is a safety risk. As mentioned earlier, one has to be fit for flying because it is a demanding task. An example from military flight illustrates the deleterious effect of illness, drugs and fatigue on flight safety. An F-14 Tomcat crashed on the deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier at night killing several of the shipâ€™s deck crew. The pilot had contracted a severe flu and had taken nasal decongestant drops without telling his flight surgeon. These drops have serious negative side effects on performance, particularly visual performance at night.
