and cones. According to the widely accepted duplicity theory of vision, rods are responsible for vision under very dim levels of illumination (scotopic vision), and cones function at higher illumination levels (photopic vision). Only cones are responsible for color vision. Therefore, at very low levels of luminance, a blind spot develops in the center of the visual field because ambient light is below cone threshold. Scotopic vision is characterized by poor acuity, lack of color discrimination and difficulty in judging distance and depth. Night flying is very different from day flying and requires more attention. The most noticeable difference is the limited availability of outside visual references. Therefore, flight instruments should be used to a greater degree in controlling the airplane. This is particularly true for night takeoffs and climbs. During daylight, one can best see an object looking directly at it, but at night a scanning procedure to permit off-center viewing is more effective. The eyeâ€™s adaptation to darkness is another important aspect of night vision. An exposure to bright light after dark adaptation will temporarily impair retinal sensitivity. 9 Additional OGHFA Materials Briefing Notes Vestibular system and illusions.
