short duration (milliseconds). In contrast, an exposure to a flare or a searchlight for longer than one second can seriously impair night vision. Maximum dark adaptation is necessary to be able to detect dim objects outside the aircraft. The valuable feature of rod vision is its abilitiy to detect movement as an image crosses the visual field. The use of red light (wavelength greater than 650 nanometers) for illumination of the cockpit is desirable because it does not affect dark adaptation. Indeed, rods are not sensitive to wavelengths of light greater than about 650 nanometers. However, red light does deteriorate dark adaptation of cones. Therefore, the use of red light maintains the greatest rod sensitivity, while still providing some illumination for central foveal vision. A drawback of red cockpit lighting is that it creates some near-vision problems and a distortion of color of objects. Low-intensity white cockpit lighting is now used to solve those problems. It enables a more natural visual environment within the aircraft without degrading the color of objects. 4.7 Night Blind Spot Due to the distribution of rods and cones on the retina, if the ambient light is below cone threshold light intensity, a blind spot 5 to 10 degrees wide develops in the center of the visual field. As a result, an object viewed directly at night may not be detected because of the night blind spot and, if it is detected, may fade away. However, since rods are much more sensitive to light than cones, objects can be detected by an exentrical fixation, i.e. looking at the objects under an angle of 17-20 degrees to one side, above or below. Proper education and training are, therefore, essential if maximum effectiveness of night vision is to be achieved. 5 Main refractive eye disorders A myopic individual does not see distant objects clearly without corrective glasses or contact lenses. A slightly myopic or marginally corrected pilot, who may see fairly well during the day, will experience blurred vision at night when viewing blue-green light. In addition, as luminance levels decrease, the focusing mechanism of the eye may move toward a resting position and increase myopia (dark focus). These are important factors when pilots look outside the cockpit during night flying. Special corrective lenses may then have to be prescribed. In hyperopia, nearby objects are focused behind the retinal plane. Objects that are nearby are not seen clearly; only more distant objects are in focus. Corrective lenses must be worn to read instruments and documentation. Astigmatism is an irregularity in the shape of the cornea that may cause an out-of-focus condition. Presbyopia is part of the normal ageing process as individuals gradually lose accommodation capability for nearby objects. When individuals are about 40 years old, their eyes lose the ability to focus on nearby objects. As presbyopia worsens, instruments, maps and checklists become more difficult to read, especially with red illumination. This difficulty can be corrected with certain types of bifocal spectacles. 6 Factors Affecting Vision (From FAA)
