The effects of heat on the performance of a vigilance task were studied as far back as the 1950s in work by Mackworth and Pepler The studies indicated that performance degrades significantly when temperatures reach 30°C. Performance is affected much less at a temperature of 26°C. In addition to degrading performance, higher temperatures also result in significant physiological changes (thermoregulation) such as a shift of blood volume to the periphery. These changes increase heart rate and blood pressure, which can affect an individual’s performance.
