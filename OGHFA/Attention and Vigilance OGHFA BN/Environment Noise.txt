Noise. The effects of noise on attention are complex. The following examples illustrate these effects: In the first example (Figure 4) subjects were asked to perform a classic clock monitoring task. In this experiment, two levels of noise were tested with either one or three clocks:. One-clock condition with 113 dB noise level versus 79 dB,. Three-clock condition with 113 dB noise level versus 79 dB. Study results showed that noise level had no significant effect on performance in the one-clock condition. In the three-clock condition, however, performance decreased significantly at the higher noise level. This result supports the idea that higher levels of noise tend to decrease the ability to share attention when several tasks are being conducted simultaneously. Figure 4. Effects of noise exposure on performance in a clock test. Another study examined the effects of noise on the simultaneous performance of a tracking task and a detection task. For the tracking task, a higher percentage of time spent on target indicated better performance. For the detection task, performance was expressed as the percentage of signals detected in a variety of positions in the visual field. Results showed that a higher level of noise helped to maintain performance on the tracking task over time. For the detection task, a higher level of noise improved performance for signals located in the center of the field, but decreased performance when a signal was in the periphery. See Figure 5.
