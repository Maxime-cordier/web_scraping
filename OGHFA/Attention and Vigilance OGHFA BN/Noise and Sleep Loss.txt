Wilkinson compared the performance of subjects during a vigilance test across four conditions that combined a noise factor with a sleep deprivation factor. Subjects had either normal sleep or were sleep deprived for 32 hours. They then carried out a task in silence or with a high level of noise. The results, shown in Figure 6, indicate that the best performance occurred in the condition combining normal sleep and silence. Noise produced a positive effect when the subjects had been deprived of sleep and a negative effect when they had slept normally. When the subjects have not been deprived of sleep, noise degrades their performance since their activation levels exceed the optimum level. Conversely, when deprived of sleep, noise improves performance, at least for a brief period, since it increases alertness levels above the required activation threshold. These results indicate that an external agent such as noise does not produce the same effects in all situations; rather the effects are dependent on factors such as the operator's sleep deprivation and alertness.
