With the high reliability of modern aircraft systems, human performance has become a key focus for flight safety. Various types of human error are often cited as contributing factors to incidents and accidents. Safety officers at airlines observe human errors and even rule violations when they monitor the safety performance of their airline through safety reports and flight data monitoring. Information or training alone cannot immunize a person or an organization against error. Improvement is only achieved through concrete improvements that make errors less probable and their consequences less severe. The primary perspective of this BN is at the organizational level. Its goal is to help personnel such as safety and training managers identify and apply the most effective systemic solutions for managing errors and violations in their organizations. While much of the material presented is also applicable at the individual level, the aim of this BN is to reduce the number and gravity of threats faced by pilots rather than to teach pilots new threat and error management techniques.
