these examples portray, the very same error can have completely different consequences, depending on the factors involved. Some error types tend to have more serious consequences than others: One common false assumption is that errors and violations are limited to incidents and accidents. Recent data from flight operations monitoring programs (e.g., LOSA) indicate that errors and violations are quite common. According to a University of Texas LOSA database, in approximately 60% of the studied flights at least one error or violation was observed, the average being 1.5 errors per flight. A quarter of the errors and violations were mismanaged or had consequences (an undesired aircraft state or an additional error). The study also indicated that a third of the errors were detected and corrected by the flight crew, 4% were detected but made worse, and more than 60% of errors remained undetected. These data underline the fact that errors are part of normal flight operations and, as such, usually are not immediately dangerous. Overall, when an error has serious consequences in a highly safety-protected system, it usually tells more about the operational system than about the error itself. Safe systems such as aviation are supposed to be engineered to manage errors in different ways to avoid serious consequences.
