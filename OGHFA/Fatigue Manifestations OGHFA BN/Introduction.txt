Pilot fatigue is a concern because it can affect flight safety, efficiency, productivity and personal health. Fatigue is recognized as one of the major factors that can impair human performance and has been cited as a cause of accidents and incidents in the transport industry. It is important for you to understand and recognize the physiological and psychological signs and effects of fatigue. Once you are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of actual or impending fatigue, you can apply proven techniques to avoid its negative outcomes. There is no universally-agreed-upon definition of what constitutes fatigue. Some describe fatigue in terms of manifestations involving muscular, sensory and mental processes that often result in negative outcomes (e.g., slowed response times, failure to detect stimuli that are discriminable, misinterpretation of sensory inputs). Others discuss fatigue in terms of its underlying causes (e.g., time on task, effort expended, sleep deprivation, circadian disruptions). Ultimately, it is important to understand both the underlying causes and the manifestations of fatigue. For the purposes of this BN, pilot fatigue refers to decreases in alertness and feeling tired, sleepy and/or exhausted. Fatigue becomes important in aviation when efficiency is reduced or performance impaired. As a pilot, you may suffer fatigue for reasons that are different from “normal” people. The nature of your job involves north/south or east/west travel (or some combination of the two), often for great distances and times. These travel-related factors, combined with workload and scheduling issues, put you at risk for some problems caused by fatigue that most non-pilots never face.
