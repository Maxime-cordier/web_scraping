During a Cat II ILS approach to a congested European airport after a very long flight, the captain had difficulty getting the autopilot to lock on to the ILS. He was virtually flying alone because the first officer and the flight engineer were incapacitated by food poisoning. The aircraft deviated to the right of the runway centerline. A go-around was performed, and the aircraft came close to buildings and people on the ground. The second approach and landing were uneventful. Safety culture was also called into question by the fact the captain did not report the incident, did not want to discuss it and was made a scapegoat by the airline. Becoming involved in a public trial, the captain could not stand the pressure and later committed suicide. The following can prevent other crews and airline managers from falling into the same traps: Adopt a positive organizational safety culture: prevent, detect, correct, communicate.. Recognize that human beings do not make mistakes on purpose.. Recognize, too, that failure to report an error is a violation that can be punished.. Ensure that reporting of errors does not result in blame, disciplinary action or liability.. Discretionary choice of restaurant and different crew meals crew may help prevent food poisoning..
