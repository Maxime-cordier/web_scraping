The following strategies might have helped the crew to recover control after the engine failure: Adherence to company SOPs: The situation and the associated factors were not formalized; no announcements of the failure were made. After the failure, standard callouts such as airspeed, vertical speed and attitude were not made. The airline’s procedures called for gear retraction, maintaining a maximum pitch angle and V2 speed. Sticking to the SOPs fosters greater self confidence and a structured frame of mind, which help avoid failing to take such vital actions as retracting the landing gear, controlling pitch attitude and vertical speed. Crew coordination and mutual control: The brusque takeover by the captain destabilized the first officer, putting her out of the loop and upsetting the crew’s task sharing. Trajectory management and flight strategy were critically affected. Proper phraseology must be used to avoid uncertainties, not only when requesting an action, but also when getting acknowledgement from the other crewmember that he or she has understood the request and has acted appropriately. In this example, that would have prevented the landing gear from remaining extended, even after several questions from the first officer. Quality of briefing and sterile cockpit concept: Adequate flight preparation, including briefings, helps the crew to: The sterile cockpit concept is implemented to concentrate on the important data the crew must share to get the same overall picture. Along with adherence to SOPs, this helps the crew to be in the proper state of mind prior to a critical flight phase such as takeoff.
