Weather conditions are excellent. You, the first officer, complete flight preparations alone, as your captain arrives late. The chief flight attendant is also on the flight deck, which causes some distraction while conducting the takeoff checklist and the announcement of the selected takeoff speeds — V1, 144 kt; VR, 146 kt; V2, 150 kt. The actual takeoff weight is close to the maximum due to the airport altitude and the high temperature. A very casual taxi to the runway takes place, not in keeping with the sterile cockpit concept. There is no briefing to prepare for takeoff contingencies, as prescribed by company procedures. The crew is not psychologically prepared to face any possible problems. Takeoff immediately follows taxiing onto the runway. You are the pilot flying. Acceleration is normal, with the standard speed announcements made up to rotation (VR). About 5 seconds after rotation, at the exact moment for landing gear retraction, a loud noise is heard from the left engine, and the aircraft veers left. You apply a correction. The captain takes over the controls, and you tell the tower, “We have a slight problem.” You offer to retract the gear several times without receiving any reply from the captain. The airplane loses altitude rapidly, with a vertical speed between 1,400 and 1,800 fpm, airspeed 160 kt and an 18-degree pitch-up attitude. The high pitch-up attitude is maintained by the captain, and stall speed is reached in a short time. Fourteen seconds after the engine noise, the ground-proximity warning system (GPWS) “DON’T SINK” alarm calls your attention to the fact that the airplane is dropping toward the ground. The control column is shaking, indicating a stall. The airplane strikes the ground tail first in a right roll, bursts into flame immediately and skids through the airport fence and across a nearby road.
