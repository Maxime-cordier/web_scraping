Sound is a compression and rarefaction of some medium such as air or water. The ear consists of the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. It contains receptors for both hearing and equilibrium (balance). Extra-auditory effects occur when biological and complex cognitive processes are affected by noise. Noise can have a negative effect on performance when multiple tasks are being performed at once, but sometimes noise can help maintain performance when a task is spread out over an extended period of time. Noise can mask speech when its magnitude is near that of the speech. As signal-to-noise ratio increases, so does the intelligibility of words. After prolonged exposure to increased noise levels, a person may experience a temporary threshold shift where signals must be “louder” than normal to be heard by the individual. This state is usually temporary but can sometimes be permanent. Exposure to noise may induce pathological effects, mainly cardio-vascular disease. This is due to the creation of high levels of adrenaline that narrow blood vessel diameter and the resultant increase in blood pressure..
