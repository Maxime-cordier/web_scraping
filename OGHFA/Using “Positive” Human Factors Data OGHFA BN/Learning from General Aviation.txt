The REC database contains reports from GA and focuses on decision making. From a human factors standpoint, commercial aviation can learn much from GA, especially when it comes to a more in-depth analysis of the decision-making process. This is because: The REC system is dedicated to collecting and disseminating this type of information to pilots and others in the aviation system. The REC approach ensures that the context of the reported decision making and actions is adequately identified, documented and reported (Benner and Rimson, 1996). It aims to avoid the retrospective fallacy that can be encountered in some investigations when the actors cannot describe their “stream of decisions” (Vaughan, 1996). Many airline pilots undertook their basic training in GA. In some public transport accident investigations, deficiencies in initial training were identified as contributing factors. Conversely, the judgment and decision making that are core parts of the training of a VFR pilot are generally not revisited in the program for commercial qualification and instrument or type ratings and can be vital to saving the day. For example, the final report of an incident in which a pilot had to perform a “dead-stick” landing in a commercial aircraft stresses: “Although he [the pilot] had never received formal training on gliding approaches, he had experienced doing power-off approaches to landing in a number of aircraft types that he had flown.”
