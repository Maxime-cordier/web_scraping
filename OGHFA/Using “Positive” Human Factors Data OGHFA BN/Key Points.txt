A potential avenue for aviation safety improvement lies in recording and disseminating decisions that have proven to be efficient in breaking a chain of events that would have led to an accident. Such a positive human factors taxonomy supports learning from successful solutions and strategies applied by others.. A positive human factors taxonomy must be as simple as possible with prescribed entries in a database system and a limited list of factors to be coded.. Pilots and other front-line operators are the sources for the positive information. It is important for them to view an incident not only in terms of its causes but also with respect to what prevented a more serious outcome.. Emphasis should be put on fine-tuning the definitions within a positive human factors taxonomy in order to achieve a common understanding of their meaning and goals.. There is much to be learned from GA decision making because it is relatively unconstrained.. The taxonomy development process should give priority to having usable and unambiguous definitions in order to support a taxonomy that would easily and consistently cope with a wide variety of situations.. The availability of a positive taxonomy would also produce a “safety exchange language” that would facilitate aviation information exchange.. The absence of any positive human factor in an occurrence could help classify the seriousness of the event and the extent to which its causal factors must be examined..
