This Situational Example describes an approach accident caused by a slam-dunk approach induced by ATC that was ignored by the crew because of its desire to push on. Understanding the particular reasons why this crew encountered problems can help realize the intricacies of being dragged into an non-stabilized approach, which is more common than one would realize. This accident was preventable if the flight crew had recognized they were driven by ATC into a high and fast situation which they could and should have refused. Addressing human factors issues in the operational situation of an non-stabilized approach after an ATC-requested runway change revealed the following: Insufficient time was taken to prepare for the essential aspects of an approach. Basic principles for slowing down — leveling off, extending the gear and configuring — before descending were omitted in preference for adapting to the display configuration by immediately increasing the descent rate and hence speed and glideslope angle. Tunnel vision under heavy workload and stress crept in, thereby disrupting judgment, critical thinking and decision making. Situational awareness was lost because of the quick succession of individual and crew-coordinated actions to try to make it to a safe landing. Teamwork to share, review and implement appropriate decisions was fragmented at the expense of PNF monitoring, respecting go-around/missed approach criteria, specific callouts, challenge response checklists, stopping performance. Pressures, stress and distractions due to unexpected events were no longer managed.
