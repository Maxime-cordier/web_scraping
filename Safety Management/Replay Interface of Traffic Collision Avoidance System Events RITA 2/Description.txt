Replay Interface of Traffic Collision Avoidance System Events (RITA) was initially developed by Centre d’Etudes de la Navigation Aérienne (CENA) in 1995 for the ACAS training of French controllers. Replay Interface of Traffic Collision Avoidance System Events (RITA 2) is a new PCbased European version whose main objectives are to include TCAS II Version 7 events and to implement modern radar and TCAS displays. A library of TCAS alert events are being assembled, selected based on their relevance to training needs.
