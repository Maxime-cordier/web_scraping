2.1 Review Terrain within 25nm 2.2 *Assess SID/STAR procedures for any possible operational issues arising 2.3 *Assess Aerodrome Operating Minima and consider carrying out at least some checking of the proprietary plates used by the operator against the State AIPs source. Check that any noise abatement requirements are included in procedures and that there is no conflict between Company power plant failure procedures and ATC Procedures. Identify the extent to which these procedures represent a radical departure from those routinely flown by the flight crew/aircraft types which would be deployed. Decide if acceptance of discretionary visual contact approaches will be permitted by the operator by day, by night or in neither case. 2.4 *If any (or even all) approaches will need to terminate with a visual final segment, review all aspects of such procedures carefully, including the day/night case and minimum in-flight visibility (IFV). 2.5 *Based upon all the above and on relevant determinations relating to aircraft performance, decide whether it is appropriate to ‘fly’ procedures in aircraft simulators to elicit any operational issues which might not otherwise be apparent. 2.6 Review overall ATC situation for any issues e.g. language(s) used on RTF and the level of English language competency beyond routine aviation English. 2.7 Establish the availability of ATC ‘safety nets’ such as Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA), Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) and Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System 2.8 *Review any increased likelihood of ‘nuisance’ Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) and Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) alerts during approach or climb out
