1.1 Make a general Airport Operator Safety Assessment covering airside WIP notification, Foreign Object Debris control, airport signage/lighting/surface marking including taxiway centreline (both standards and maintenance). Examine a copy of the Airport Safety Management System document. 1.2 *Establish that the runway and taxiway pavement surface structures and dimensions are sufficient for the intended aircraft type(s) 1.3 *Review Aircraft ground handling contractor(s) responsibilities with particular reference to aircraft loading certification, dangerous goods procedures and the ramp handling of aircraft 1.4 *Review the airside procedures of the Passenger handling contractor 1.5 *Consider arrangements for aircraft line maintenance 1.6 Review fuel supply arrangements and any possible fuel quality issues 1.7 *If appropriate, establish or review arrangements for aircraft ground de/anti icing 1.8 Review standard airport security provision and consider if there is any case for enhanced security screening of freight, baggage or passengers. In particular consider the expected passenger profile with special regard to both the potential for disruptive behaviour in flight fuelled by alcohol and any possibility of an increased propensity to attempt to smoke covertly in flight 1.9 *Review RFFS capability in relation to intended aircraft type(s) 1.10 Establish if there is any special degree of Bird Strike (or other wildlife) hazard, including seasonally, and if so assess the appropriateness of the mitigation - especially coastal sites, urban areas with poorly controlled refuse tipping and any tendency for seasonal shallow water bodies in vicinity 1.11 ATS Ground movement practices including directed taxi routing or general guidance procedures. 1.12 ATS runway use - is more than one active runway designated at any one time? If so, review any intersecting runway or runway crossing issues 1.13 *Aircraft Type specific ground issues - dimensions re taxi routes, gates, remote parking stands etc 1.14 Runway undershoot or over-run issues - establish and consider if specific flight crew awareness is warranted 1.15 Runway Surface safety - profile issues (linear and transverse); reference friction records and cleaning of rubber deposits; braking action/friction performance when wet but not contaminated; procedures for measuring and communicating braking action when surface is contaminated; surface water drainage characteristics (profile, pavement wearing surface, grooving) 1.16 Weather Record - Wind Velocity, Visibility, Temperature range and prevalence of sudden short-duration heavy precipitation
