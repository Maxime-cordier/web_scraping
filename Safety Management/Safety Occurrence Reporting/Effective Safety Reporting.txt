Effective safety reporting of hazards by operational personnel is an important cornerstone of the management of safety. Therefore, an operational environment in which operational personnel have been trained and are constantly encouraged to report hazards is the prerequisite for effective safety reporting. According to ICAO Doc 9859 Safety Management Manual, the effective safety reporting builds upon certain basic attributes, such as: a) senior management places strong emphasis on hazard identification as part of the strategy for the management of safety, and as a consequence there is an awareness of the importance of communicating hazard information at all levels of the organisation; b) senior management and operational personnel hold a realistic view of the hazards faced by the organisationâ€™s service delivery activities, and as a consequence there are realistic rules relating to hazards and potential sources of damage; c) senior management defines the operational requirements needed to support active hazard reporting, ensures that key safety data are properly registered, demonstrates a receptive attitude to the reporting of hazards by operational personnel and implements measures to address the consequences of hazards; d) senior management ensures that key safety data are properly safeguarded and promotes a system of checks and balances so that reporters of hazards feel confident that hazard reporting will not be put to uses other than for which it was implemented (the management of safety); e) personnel are formally trained to recognize and report hazards and understand the incidence and consequences of hazards in the activities supporting delivery of services; and f) there is a low incidence of hazardous behaviour, and a safety ethic which discourages such behaviour. According to ICAO there are five basic traits which are connected to the effective safety reporting systems (Figure 1). The basic attributes of effective safety reporting discussed are explained as follows:
