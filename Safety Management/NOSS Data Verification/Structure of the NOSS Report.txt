It is proposed that, as a minimum, the NOSS report comprises the following sections: a) Section 1. Introduction and executive summary b) Section 2. Threat profile of the ATS provider c) Section 3. Error profile of the ATS provider d) Section 4. Undesired state profile of the ATS provider e) Section 5. Identified good practices f) Section 6. Lessons learned by conducting the NOSS g) Section 7. Closing comments h) Appendices (may be added as required, e.g. the forms and code books used). Consideration should be given to providing a set of "raw data" (i.e. the narratives from the observations) with the report for the purpose of conducting future analyses.
