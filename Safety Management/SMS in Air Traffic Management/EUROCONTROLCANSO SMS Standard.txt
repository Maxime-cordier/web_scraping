EUROCONTROL in cooperation with Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO) have developed an SMS Standard. The standard aims to facilitate the practical implementation of ICAO safety management requirements by ANSPs. The SMS Standard consists of a ‘system enabler’ (Safety Culture), and a framework of four components - Safety Policy, Safety Achievement, Safety Assurance, and Safety Promotion. Within all of these areas, there are one or more elements. Figure 1 below depicts the interaction between these areas. Together, they are considered to constitute a mature and systematic safety framework. SMS Standard
