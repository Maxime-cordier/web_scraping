The ‘Pros and Cons’ of integrating the different management systems aviation service providers are required to implement and maintain have been studied by various organisations over the recent years. One of the main drivers for implementing an integrated management system is the efficient use of available resources. A number of models were identified by the research activities ranging from ‘discrete’ through ‘partially integrated’ to ‘fully integrated’. Many ANS providers have made the first step towards partial integration of safety and quality management by setting up a common safety & quality management unit (Directorate). The prospects for the future implementation of an integrated management system will be studied further in the R & D work to be carried out within the scope of SESAR.
