Risk Assessment is an evaluation based on engineering and operational judgement and/or analysis methods in order to establish whether the achieved or perceived risk is acceptable or tolerable. Risk is the assessed potential for adverse consequences resulting from a hazard. It is the likelihood that the hazardâ€™s potential to cause harm will be realised. (ICAO Doc 9859) Risk means the combination of the overall probability or frequency of occurrence of a harmful effect induced by a hazard and the severity of that effect. (Regulation (EU) 2017/373)
