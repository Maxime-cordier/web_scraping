Today there is a tremendous amount of normal operational data available along with many new, efficient data processing tools to effectively exploit that data. Basic risk management tells us that identifying hazards, and then evaluating the probability and severity of the hazard, enables us to determine the risk. The availability today of normal operational data and the tools to effectively use that data enables us to identify hazards previously only discovered by an accident or serious incident. To be predictive we must be able to use normal operational data and modern data processing tools to show the potential risk and identify the benefits of reducing that risk by addressing the probability or the severity of hazards identified in the data.
