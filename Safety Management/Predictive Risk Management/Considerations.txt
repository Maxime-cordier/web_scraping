Regulators and safety investigation organizations are reactive by nature, so a shift to being predictive will not be easy. Our wealth of data today enables us to not only look at past accidents and incidents, but to also see what is happening in normal day to day operations. This allows us to identify hazards and see what and where the current risk trends are, and to identify potential or new risks. There are two keys to being successful at being predictive in a reactive world: To get the decision makers support, there is a critical requirement that must happen - a change in paradigm. We now have the data to look at events – both significant and normal – to identify hazards and determine areas for potential risk reduction. However, our current safety system focuses on negative outcomes, not events. If an event does not have a negative outcome, it is rarely investigated. For example, after the Air France 447 accident several similar events were discovered. However, they were just events, and none of them had a negative outcome so they were just part of the normal operational data that was collected and the hazard, and resultant significant risk, was not identified and acted on. In another example, in a recent fatal takeoff accident the aircraft was unable to rotate for takeoff due to the controls being locked. The investigation determined that the flight crew rarely conducted pre-takeoff control checks, which would have discovered the locked controls. Since the lack of control checks were not a caution or a warning and were not an exceedence of accepted parameters, and not doing a pre-takeoff control check did not result in a negative event, it went unnoticed.
