Generally the line personnel are aware where the areas of risk are. Line managers and operational staff typically have best perceptions of where to look for risks and areas for improvement in their fields of responsibility. Surveys completed by operational personnel can provide important diagnostic information about daily operations and valuable insight into the: Perceptions and opinions of operational personnel;. Level of teamwork and cooperation among various employee groups;. Problem areas or bottlenecks in daily operations;. Corporate safety culture;. Current areas of dissent or confusion.. It is important for the organisation to fully realise that safety surveys can be obstructed by subjectivism. That is why close attention is needed when producing the safety survey report and interpreting the results from it. The bias can be found not only in the participantâ€™s opinion but also during the creation and interpretation processes.
