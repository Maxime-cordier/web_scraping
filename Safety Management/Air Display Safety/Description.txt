Whilst air safety is about the safety of both those in an aircraft and those on the ground, the usual absence of passengers except as volunteers means that the emphasis in the case of air display safety is very much on the safety of those on the ground. Whilst this is to some extent dependent on the way a display aircraft is required to be maintained and flown, it is also affected by the way in which the freedom to mount air displays is constrained. This summary will be concerned almost entirely with civil air display safety.
