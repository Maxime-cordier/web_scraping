Air displays may be subject to safety regulation by either civil or military authorities depending on the location of a display and the identity of the organising agency. In both cases a risk-based approach is required. In the case of civil air displays, the ultimately responsible regulator may elect to devolve the oversight of applicable regulations - and sometimes also their detailed formulation - to approved persons or organisations with requisite experience. Such persons would be likely to be regularly and directly involved in air displays in either a professional or voluntary capacity. A display may be an event in itself or may take place as part of another event which may or may not be an 'Air Show'.
