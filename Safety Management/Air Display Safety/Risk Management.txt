In respect of location, it is usual for any air display to require explicit permission from or on behalf of the applicable aviation regulatory authority. It is also usually necessary for the overall 'technical' responsibility for any air display to be vested in a named individual who, for the purposes of such responsibility at a specific event, will typically be accorded a title of or equivalent to 'Flying Display Director' (FDD). It is usual for relevant experience commensurate with such a role to be required for such a position. For a complex or extensive display, a Committee made up of appropriately qualified/experienced members may be formed to assist the FDD in the discharge of their responsibilities. The individual appointed as FDD will usually be expected to ensure that the risks arising from display aircraft in flight both within the display area and in its vicinity are appropriately mitigated. The UK AAIB has estimated that in the UK, "65% of display accidents involved (a single aircraft) crashing outside the area controlled by the organisers of the display" so the need to liaise with non-aviation authorities which have general responsibility for public safety is clear. In respect of the direct risk if any display aircraft follows an unexpected/unanticipated flight path, the pilot of any civil or military aircraft taking part in a display will usually be required to hold a specific personal authority which is often called a 'Display Authorisation' or DA. Explicit requirements for the issue and retention of such authorisations are usually promulgated. The overall risk inherent in a display and the appropriate mitigation of that risk will usually be directly related to the type of aircraft involved, the extent to which display by that aircraft involves aerobatic or formation manoeuvres and the competence of the pilot, particularly with respect to their experience in terms of both its relevance and recency.
