NOSS observations will not be held in on-the-job (OJT) training or check situations. In a typical observation session, lasting up to 1 hour and 30 minutes, a single controller working position will be observed, even if the controller observed is working with another controller as part of a team. Observed controllers will know that they are being observed, and they will also know the purpose of the observation. Controller participation is voluntary, i.e. a controller can refuse to be observed for NOSS purposes.
