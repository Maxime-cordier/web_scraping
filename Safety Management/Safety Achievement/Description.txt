The modern management of safety of aviation operations increasingly relies on a spectrum of dedicated organisational arrangements, methods and processes to manage proactively the risk. Worldwide, there is no uniform definition of the set of arrangements, processes, methods and procedures which, when applied in a consistent manner, will ensure achievement of the organisationâ€™s safety objectives. The scope of Safety Achievement as defined in EUROCONTROL ESARR 3 includes also the Safety Risk Management component of the ICAO SMS Framework. The framework established by ESARR 3 is generic enough and can be applied widely by the different aviation services provider organisations. The Safety Achievement domain includes the following components: The Safety Achievement components are closely interrelated and can not be implemented and applied in isolation. Only a consistent, integrated and systematic application of these processes and procedures will help increase the aviation system resistance to unsafe acts and hazardous conditions.
