EUROCONTROL - Risk Assessment and Mitigation in ATM The table below has been extracted from EUROCONTROL ESARR4 - Risk Assessment and Mitigation in ATM. It associates the severity class (determined using a severity classification scheme) with a tolerable probability (i.e., a maximum tolerable probability of ATM directly contributing to safety occurrences) to show that the more severe the effect of the hazard the less desirable it is that the hazard occurs. Note: The risk classification scheme only refers to an overall safety performance of ATM at ECAC and national level and is not directly applicable to the classification of individual hazards. To achieve this, a method of apportionment of the overall probability to the constituent parts of the ATM system may need to be developed. This apportionment may be done per phase of flight and/or, per accident types. Severity classes are defined as follows: Quantitative expressions for severity classes 2,3,4,5 are yet to be determined.
