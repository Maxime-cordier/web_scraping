As the demands on airspace are ever increasing, the point is approaching whereby the delivery of additional capacity can only be achieved by introducing significant changes in the ATM operations. Many of the airspace structures in place today were designed at a time when noise and fuel burn were not priority concerns. During later periods of intense growth in air traffic, changes in airspace structures have often been brought about in order to accommodate air traffic demand. More recently however, greater emphasis has been placed on flight efficiency, which goes hand-in-hand with environmental issues. This means that there are a variety of pressures from both the ATM community and ‘society’, driving such change forward, as well as inhibiting such change. In Europe, the Single European Sky (SES) legislative initiative has triggered a large process of change, integrated with the ATM modernisation project, SESAR. In United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched NextGen, a programme to modernize the National Airspace System (NAS).
