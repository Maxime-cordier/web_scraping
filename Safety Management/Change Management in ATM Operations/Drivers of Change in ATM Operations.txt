The drivers of change in ATM Operations can be split into two broad categories: The drivers of change are often interconnected. For example, a new process or technology will require stakeholder influence to bring about its introduction. However, the detail of a change, the way in which it is operationally implemented, is primarily driven either by a stakeholder influence, or by a new process or technology. These broad categories can be further broken down as shown below: Some changes may be driven by factors in a ‘top-down’ manner, for example the Single European Sky initiative driven by EUROCONTROL. Other changes may be driven in a ‘bottom-up’ manner, e.g. noise reductions at an airport, demanded by local residents. Whilst some changes can be brought about with quite a tight focus in one particular area (e.g. a change in a standing agreement between two adjacent ATC sectors), other changes such as the Single European Sky initiative, will have wide implications across many categories of change. These descriptions of categories are not designed to be either prescriptive or restrictive ways of thinking about change, but rather to help think about change in a systematic way. This means that important considerations are taken into account when trying to measure, understand and assess a change.
