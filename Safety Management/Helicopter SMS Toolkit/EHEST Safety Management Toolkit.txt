The Toolkit has been developed with consideration being given to the Annex III to the EU regulation on Air Operations, Part ORO Subpart GEN Section II ‘Management System’ and the relevant AMCs and GM, published in October 2012. The first Safety Management Toolkit targets Complex Operators as set out in AMC1 ORO.GEN.200(b) Management System, and will be mostly beneficial for those operators with little experience of running an SMS. The 2nd edition was published in May 2013. EHEST also released in December 2013 a Safety Management Toolkit for non-Complex Operators. The EHEST Safety Management Toolkit contains the following three components: The EHEST Company Safety Management Manual (SMM). The EHEST Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The EHEST Safety Management Database User Guide.

Download the EHEST SMS Toolkit for non-Complex Operations, 2nd Edition, October 2014 The SMM for non-Complex Operators is a sample manual designed to assist an operator in creating their own manual. It contains explanatory notes and instructions marked in italics. The SMM must be adapted to appropriately reflect the operator’s organisation and needs and should not be applied ‘as is’. Training organisations may benefit from another EHEST publication: the EHEST Leaflet (HE5) Risk Management in Training. This document was developed with major stakeholders and provides tools and methods for risk management in training. Training for autorotation is used as a practical example to illustrate the process. That process is compatible with the approach presented in the EHEST SMS Toolkits. Download the EHEST Leaflet (HE5) Risk Management in Training, March 2013
