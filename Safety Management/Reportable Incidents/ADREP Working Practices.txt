Data Analysis. When ADREP reports are collected from States, the information is first checked and then stored into a database. The stored information constitutes a data bank of world-wide occurrences to provide States with the following services: a) a bi-monthly summary of reports received, providing States with an up-to-date picture of significant occurrences on a world-wide basis, as well as with an opportunity to check their reports as processed by ICAO. States are requested to advise ICAO of any errors found; b) annual ADREP statistics, presenting statistical information under broad categories such as the types of events which took place and the phases of operation in which they occurred; and c) replies to Statesâ€™ requests for specific information. When States are requesting information for specific safety issues, they should forward to ICAO a request for information outlining the problem under study. Replies from ICAO may be sent using mail, telex, etc., depending on the urgency of the request and the amount of data to be sent. Protection of Data. Considering the sensitivity in some States regarding the dissemination of incident information, the following constraints are placed upon the use of incident data: a) ICAO will use incident information for the purpose of accident prevention only; b) ICAO will not conduct analyses based only on aircraft incident information without identifying it as such; and c) ICAO will, before publication, delete the name of the State of Registry, the registration and the name of the owner/operator
