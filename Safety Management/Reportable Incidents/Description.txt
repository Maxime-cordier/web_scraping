In accordance with provisions laid down in Annex 13 â€” Aircraft Accident Investigation, Member States shall report to ICAO information on all aircraft accidents which involve aircraft of a maximum certificated take-off mass of over 2 250 kg. ICAO also collects information on aircraft incidents considered important for safety and accident prevention. The State in which the occurrence takes place must inform the State of Registry; the State of the Operator; the State of Design; the State of Manufacture; and ICAO as soon as possible. The notification shall be in plain language and its content shall contain as many as possible items from the list provided in ICAO Annex 13, Chapter 4 "Notification". The investigation of an accident or of a serious incident is a responsibility of the State in which the occurrence takes place. This responsibility is usually exercised by the national accident and incident investigation board, which is normally a department of the transport ministry and independent of the civil aviation authority. In some States, investigation is the responsibility of the national judicial system.
