In the ADREP system, the occurrence is described by event-specific unique code identifiers. ADREP Reporting forms can be obtained here.. ADREP 2000 standard Taxonomies defined by an international working group chaired by ICAO can be obtained here.. The forms provide space for input for five pairs of events and phase of flight. Since events and phases of flight are to be stored into an electronic data base, it is necessary to use standard terms when completing the forms and to be as specific as possible. The pairs in the form must be complete; an event without its matching phase of flight is of little value to ICAO.
