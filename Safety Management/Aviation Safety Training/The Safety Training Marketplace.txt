The provision of training, including in the field of safety, is an activity run mostly on a commercial basis. A considerable number of training organisations deliver courses using either standard syllabi, or customised to meet specific organisational needs. As an example, in Europe, it is possible to acquire formal courses on European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) requirements from a range of suppliers in a range of languages. Suppliers include bespoke training companies, but also consultancy or commercial training enterprises run by aviation companies, such as major airlines, aviation maintenance organisations and even aviation-related universities. In certain cases, training courses are provided to individuals from member states of international organisations, either free or at reduced prices, as part of the benefits of membership of those organisations. International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EUROCONTROL are two examples of organisations which operate this system.
