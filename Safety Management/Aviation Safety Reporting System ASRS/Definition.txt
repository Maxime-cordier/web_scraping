Aviation Safety Reporting System The ASRS was established in April 1976 under an agreement between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration as an independent scheme for voluntary aviation occurrence reporting in the USA which would confer conditional immunity from FAA Enforcement Action as a means of encouraging reports of lapses which might otherwise not be known about.
