Safety information exchange often occurs at the following GSIP-defined levels of risk management intensity: There are a number of safety information exchanges, of varying size and complexity, operating in the commercial aviation industry. One of the most extensive is the U.S. FAAâ€™s Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) program, which connects a variety of safety data and information sources across government and industry, including voluntarily reported safety data. ASIAS works closely with the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) and the General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) to monitor known risk, evaluate the effectiveness of deployed mitigations, and detect emerging risk. ASIAS also partners with the industry-sponsored InfoShare meeting, which facilitates, in a controlled and confidential environment, the sharing of safety issues and best practices in a protected environment. Programs like ASIAS and CAST are operational and/or are being developed in other regions of the world to facilitate the exchange/sharing of safety information. Smaller, more localised efforts also have been established between stakeholders with individual countries or operating into select airports.
