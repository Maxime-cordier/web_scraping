The FSF’s Global Safety Information Project (GSIP) defines safety information as the end product of aviation safety data being collected, processed, organised and presented to make it useful to each stakeholder organisation. GSIP categorizes the most common data sources as public safety information, safety program information and reportable occurrences. Safety information exchange means sharing safety information at various levels of risk management intensity by formal agreement across organisational domains — including national and regional entities — to increase safety program effectiveness by techniques such as: Pairing different operational and safety data sets to develop a more complete risk picture;. Gaining greater insight into systemic risks identified by other domains or organizations;. Understanding the efficacy of mitigations implemented by other domains or organizations;. Identifying opportunities to implement changes that benefit the global aviation system, not just a targeted domain or stakeholder;. Holistically understanding the effectiveness of procedural and technological enhancements; and. Monitoring the integrity of end-to-end operations to identify emerging needs..
