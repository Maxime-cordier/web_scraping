Confidential Aviation Incident Reporting (CAIR) was instituted by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) in 1988 as a supplement to their mandatory reporting system, the Air Safety Incident Report (ASIR). The program’s focus is on systems, procedures and equipment, rather than on individuals. Confidential Aviation Incident Reporting (CAIR) aims to gather data that would not be reported under a mandatory system. It covers: The program is designed to capture information, no matter how minor the incident. While confidentiality is maintained, the report must not be anonymous or contain unverifiable information. The ATSB supplement in the ‘Flight Safety Australia’ magazine is the primary method of publishing a report and obtaining feedback on Confidential Aviation Incident Reporting (CAIR) issues. Publication of selected Confidential Aviation Incident Reporting (CAIR) reports on the Internet is planned. Confidential Aviation Incident Reporting (CAIR) already covers all aspects of Australian civil aviation. Air safety investigations are performed by ATSB independent of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) (the regulator) and AirServices Australia (the air traffic service provider). The ATSB has no power to implement its recommendations.
