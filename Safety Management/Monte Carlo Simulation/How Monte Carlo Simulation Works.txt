A Monte Carlo simulation performs a risk analysis of any chosen decision factor that has inherent uncertainty. It does this by building models of possible results using a probability distribution; that is, by substituting a range of values for any specific factor chosen by the decision maker. It then calculates the results numerous times, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions. Depending upon the number of factors which are considered "uncertain" and the range of possible values specified for each of them, a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands, or even tens of thousands, of recalculations. The final products of a Monte Carlo simulation are distributions of possible outcome values. By using probability distributions, variables can have different probabilities of different outcomes occurring. The probability distribution chosen for the simulation will depend upon the type of problem under investigation. Common probability distributions include: During a Monte Carlo simulation, values are sampled at random from the chosen probability distributions. Each discrete sample set is referred to as an iteration and the resulting outcome from the calculations for that sample is recorded. A Monte Carlo simulation will repeat this process hundreds, thousands or even tens of thousands of times depending upon the complexity of the problem. The compiled results from all of the iterations is a probability distribution of the possible outcomes that lie within the parameters chosen by the user. A Monte Carlo simulation thus provides a comprehensive view of not only what could happen, but how likely it is to happen.
