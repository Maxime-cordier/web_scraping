The used approach to model development allows for expansion, both by adding new aspects such as variability or dynamics and by adding new functions or further detail. The current version is static, lacking information on dynamic properties of the system. Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) is proposed to model complex socio-technical systems and is based on SADT adding two new “sides” to the function description, namely time and preconditions. These two new properties describe dynamics and thus adding these new features to the functions is a way to integrate dynamics in the existing model. The main difficulty will be to obtain this information for the existing system. Adding it in the current knowledge database will be straightforward. Variability is another FRAM characteristic associated with the system dynamics, used to explain why functions can become coupled and how this leads to unexpected outcomes. It is a function property relevant for the outputs and studies are needed to find the best way to add this knowledge to the model. The following figure depicts the existing knowledge and framework database and possible evolution plug-ins, covering the three layers: The model in green. The coded knowledge inside the dark blue box. The automated view inside the turquoise box and reliant on the coded knowledge. Notes on figure above: Green, yellow and orange boxes: Already existing. Straight line: Finished. Dotted boxes: Work started. Grey boxes: To be added..
