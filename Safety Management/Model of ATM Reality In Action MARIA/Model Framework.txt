The model framework is open allowing the easy addition of new properties to the existing descriptions, and new areas or systems, e.g. the aircraft functions. All functions, data flows, connections and hierarchy are coded in YAML, a human-readable data serialisation format. This data is considered to be a knowledge database which can be enlarged both to introduce new functions or data flows and to insert further knowledge such as function characteristics. Tools exist to automatically check the consistency of the knowledge database and to produce views. Currently the framework provides the following automated functionalities: loading, checking, filtering, and documentation production. The checking functionality automatically verifies that the knowledge database is coherent, that all flows have a start and an end, all functions and flows have a parent except for the top level ones, the functional decomposition does not lose or create flows.
