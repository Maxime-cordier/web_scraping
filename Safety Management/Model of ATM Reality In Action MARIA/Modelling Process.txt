MARIA was developed capturing the work performed daily at NAV Portugal to provide ATM services via interviews with the people actually doing the work. The questions addressed what is done to ensure safe provision of services, in line with the Safety II approach. The interviews were preceded by collection of information from existing documentation to allow a better understanding by the interviewers of the subject and thus allow for a better lead and structure of the interviews. The information was captured in a bottom-up way and afterwards consolidated in a top-down model. The achievement of this abstract view is one of the major advantages of the work carried out. A first version of the generic ATM architecture was released at the start of 2014. The local architecture descriptions were built and distributed for validation by operational and maintenance staff from the sites in the second quarter of 2014. More than fifty people were involved and over 3000 work hours were invested. MARIA is based on the day-to-day activities modelled top-down, starting with very high level functions which are systematically decomposed down to the level where the resources performing them can be identified. The level of abstraction is kept uniform at each level of function decomposition to ensure that the description covers all system parts (is complete), and facilitates verification and validation. The modularity of the model allows the addition of new blocks, derived either from new features or changes in scope. The main difficulties with the modelling were:
