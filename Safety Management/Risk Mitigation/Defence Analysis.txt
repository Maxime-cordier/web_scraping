Section 6.4.4 of ICAO Doc 9859 - Safety Management Manual suggests that defence analysis is carried out as a first step towards mitigation of risk by an organisation. Careful examination of the existing defences (often called “safety barriers” in ATM) should establish whether these defences can reduce to a satisfactory degree the probability of occurrence and/or the severity of the harmful effects (consequences) associated to the risk. According to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the defences within an aviation service provider organisation can be described as: Physical defences, including specially designed hardware and software that discourage or prevent inappropriate action, or mitigate the consequences of events (e.g., software with built in safety warning functions, warnings and alarms, switch covers, firewalls, survival equipment, etc).. Administrative defences, including regulations, procedures and practices that mitigate the probability of occurrence of an accident/incident (e.g., safety regulations, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), local procedures, supervision and inspection, training, competency schemes etc).. In case the defences fail to contain and reduce the risk, an analysis should be conducted to determine why they did not provide adequate safety protection.
