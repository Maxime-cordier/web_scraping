Section 6.4.4 of ICAO Doc 9859 - Safety Management Manual suggests that defence analysis is carried out as a first step towards mitigation of risk by an organisation. Careful examination of the existing defences (often called “safety barriers” in ATM) should establish whether these defences can reduce to a satisfactory degree the probability of occurrence and/or the severity of the harmful effects (consequences) associated to the risk. According to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the defences within an aviation service provider organisation can be described as: In case the defences fail to contain and reduce the risk, an analysis should be conducted to determine why they did not provide adequate safety protection.
