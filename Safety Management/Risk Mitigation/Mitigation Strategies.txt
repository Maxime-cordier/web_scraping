An organisation should identify the most appropriate strategy (or strategies) to control the risks associated with the services provided. Examples of such strategies are: Exposure avoidance. Risky task, practice, operation or activity is avoided if the associated risk is determined to exceed the benefits.. Loss reduction. Measures are taken to reduce the frequency of occurrence of unsafe (unwanted) events or the severity of their effects (consequences).. Control of exposure (by separation or duplication). Action is taken to isolate the risks or to ensure redundancy to protect against the risks (e.g. use of non-flammable insulation materials and partitions, back-up systems to reduce the likelihood of total system failure, etc.). Establishing effective risk mitigation strategies and measures is a challenging task. Experience and knowledge of the particular operational environment is often not sufficient to select the best possible solution. Open mind, creativity and ability to think “outside the box” are needed to overcome the rigid mindsets and biases of those who are closest to the problem. Not all risk are manageable to the extent that they are no longer a factor or it is often economically impractical to use certain strategy (the cost overcomes the benefit). Generally, risks have to be managed to a level known as “as low as reasonably practicable” or ALARP. This means that the risk must be balanced against the time, cost and difficulty of taking measures to reduce or eliminate the risk.
