As the competency requirements and safety responsibilities and accountabilities need to be defined for all safety-related positions throughout the organisation, the operators/service providers must ensure that: Competency is closely interrelated with other important aspects of safety management. Building and maintaining staff competence is an essential part of the safety planning process in the organisation. Often, recommendations for safety improvement are aimed for provision of dedicated training and/or implementation of specific competency requirements. The active dissemination of key safety messages throughout the organisation also facilitates staff competence enhancement. Although less formal than training programmes, sharing lessons learned (for example through staff briefings, safety publications, message boards or internal electronic forums, etc.) contributes to improved staff knowledge and experience. The positive safety culture is also a powerful driver for continuous staff competence improvement. It underpins the personnel self-motivation and pursuit of increased knowledge and skills.
