Safety Assessment Made Easier (SAME) is developed by EUROCONTROL as an extension of SAM. While SAM is focused on the negative contribution to risk, SAME also considers the positive contribution of the concept under investigation to aviation safety. It does this by proposing a ‘broader approach to safety assessment’, consisting of complementary success and failure approaches: The success approach seeks to show that an ATM system will be acceptably safe in the absence of failure;. The failure approach seeks to show that an ATM system will still be acceptably safe, taking into account the possibility of (infrequent) failure.. In SAME, the safety assessment is driven by a safety argument structured according to system assurance objectives and activities.
