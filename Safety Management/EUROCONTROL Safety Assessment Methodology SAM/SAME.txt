Safety Assessment Made Easier (SAME) is developed by EUROCONTROL as an extension of SAM. While SAM is focused on the negative contribution to risk, SAME also considers the positive contribution of the concept under investigation to aviation safety. It does this by proposing a ‘broader approach to safety assessment’, consisting of complementary success and failure approaches: In SAME, the safety assessment is driven by a safety argument structured according to system assurance objectives and activities.
