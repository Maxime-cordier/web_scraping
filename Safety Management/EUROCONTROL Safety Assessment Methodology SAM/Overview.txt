The safety assessment activities included in the scope of SAM can be sub-divided into: The objective of the methodology is to define a means for providing assurance that an Air Navigation System is safe for operational use. It is an iterative process conducted throughout the system development life cycle, from initial system definition, through design, implementation, integration, transfer to operations, to operations and maintenance. The iterative process consists of a Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA), a Preliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA) and a System Safety Assessment (SSA).
