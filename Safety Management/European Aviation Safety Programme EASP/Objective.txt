The objective of the European Aviation Safety Programme is to ensure that the system for the management of aviation safety in the European Union (EU) delivers a safety performance that is the best of any world region, uniformly enjoyed across the whole Union, and continuing to improve over time. In doing so the EU will use, as a measurement of success, the rate of fatal accidents per 10 million flights per world region. The strategy for aviation safety in the EU for the coming years was established by the European Commission in a Communication to the Council and the European Parliament called Setting up an Aviation Safety Management System for Europe.
