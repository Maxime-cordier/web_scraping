Quantitative safety levels are data presented in numerical terms in order to help estimate target levels of safety and measure the degree of their achievement in quantitative terms. According to ICAO Doc 9859 - Safety Management Manual, “Whenever quantitative safety performance targets are set, it must be possible to measure, or estimate, the achieved level of safety in quantitative terms. Use of quantitative data helps clarify most decisions and should be used where available.” Provisions in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1035/2011 of 17 October 2011 (see further reading), and EUROCONTROL ESARR 3 place a requirement on ATS providers in Europe to “...ensure that, whenever practicable, quantitative safety levels are derived and are maintained for all functional systems”. Consistent with ICAO standards and recommended practices the Group of Aerodrome Safety Regulators (GASR), has established safety management requirements for aerodrome operators, including: “Whenever practicable, quantitative safety levels shall be derived, maintained and improved for all aviation products and services delivered by the Aerodrome. When quantitative safety levels cannot be derived a qualitative reasoning shall be performed in order to meet the safety objectives”. Quantitative safety data is also extensively used in aircraft manufacturing industry. It is essential for determining the airworthiness of aircraft structures and employs a vast amount of mathematically derived expressions. Examples of quantitative expressions of such information are: the airframe life cycles expectancy, the results of analysis of a composite materials used in airframe and engine manufacturing, analytical fatigue estimation of the aircraft components and systems, and many more.
