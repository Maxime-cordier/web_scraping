Three SDCPS-focused GSIP toolkits were published in 2017. These toolkits are intended to assist the global aviation community elevate its safety risk management capabilities and information sharing practices. Each toolkit contains data-driven recommendations and best practices identified by industry for the development and maturation of various safety data collection systems, data analysis methods, information sharing practices, and safety information protections. The toolkits are designed for a wide range of aviation domains, including air navigation service providers, airlines/aircraft operators, airports, manufacturers, maintainers and regulators. A safety performance indicator (SPI) survey was developed to gain insight into how the aviation industry is using safety data to define safety performance targets (SPTs) and SPIs. An interactive SPI survey dashboard was developed to enable the public to conduct detailed analyses of SPI survey results.
