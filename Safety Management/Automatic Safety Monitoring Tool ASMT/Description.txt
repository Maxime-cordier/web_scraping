The ASMT (Automatic Safety Monitoring Tool) is the unique EUROCONTROL tool for the detection, storage and analysis of ATM related events with a potential relevance for safety. For each detected event, that can be ATM related safety occurrence in a defined airspace, ASMT records multiple data on a dedicated server, from which it is possible to extract and review them, through radar tracks, flight plans and safety nets data. When, according to criteria (parameters) that have been set in advance, a safety event occurs, data about the involved flights are recorded and stored in a database. The ASMT Human Machine Interface (HMI) can then be used to retrieve and replay the occurrence information, including flight plans and radar track data of involved aircraft. The ASMT also offers a module for simple statistical analyses. However, data can be queried and exported into formats that allow the use of third-party statistical tools, in case more advanced analysis should be needed. Data can be de-identified in order to keep identity of involved personnel undisclosed. ASMT development started in the 1990 decade. Since then, several versions of the tool have been developed and detection modules added (see ASMT Factsheet, 2020) Nowadays several ANSPs throughout the whole of Europe are using ASMT for different purposes.
