FAA is shifting its culture “because the aviation environment has reached a level of complexity where we cannot achieve further safety improvements by following a purely rule-based approach," the agency said. "Therefore, FAA will encourage a more proactive approach with airports, airmen, and organizations to disclose and develop measures that identify safety risks, prevent deviations, and ensure corrective actions are taken when deviations exist. At the same time, FAA is evolving its internal processes to a risk-based model that better targets our energy and resources.” (FAA, Compliance Program)
