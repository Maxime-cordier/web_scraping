The intent of a safety management system is to have in place an organised and orderly approach in the management of aerodrome safety by the aerodrome operator. The SMS shall clearly define lines of safety accountability throughout the organisation, including a direct accountability for safety on the part of senior management. Moreover, according to Doc 9774 - Manual on Certification of Aerodromes, all parties operating on an aerodrome shall comply with the aerodrome safety requirements and shall participate in the SMS. The SMS shall be documented in the Aerodrome Manual. This should include names and positions of key personnel, including their responsibilities for safety, as well as the safety interfaces (lines of communication and cooperation) with local ATM and CNS, if these are not part of the aerodrome organisation. An aerodrome safety manager shall be identified who has the overall responsibility for aerodrome safety. The Safety Manager shall be supported by airport safety committee(s).
