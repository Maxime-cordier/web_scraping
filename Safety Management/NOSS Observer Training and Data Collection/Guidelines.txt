In order to ensure that ATC operations during NOSS observations be as close to “normal” as possible, it is essential that the observers be as unobtrusive as they can be when in the operations room or tower. This means that observers should avoid discussions with the staff on duty (to the extent of not being perceived as unsociable or impolite) and should not comment on what they see. They should also not take extensive notes or fill out any type of forms during the observations. All of these and similar activities will make a particular session less normal than if the observer were not present and are therefore not desired.
