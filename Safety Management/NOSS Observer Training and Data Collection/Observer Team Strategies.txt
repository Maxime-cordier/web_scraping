The support provided to the observers during NOSS takes many forms. Some support is achieved through direct person-to-person contact and reassurance. In other instances support is achieved through more indirect means, e.g. skill training or administrative backup. To gain a better understanding of the support required for a successful NOSS, it is useful to look at some of the more specific forms support may take. The NOSS facilitator or the data analyst should constantly monitor the quality of the data in the observation reports received, as well as look for any sensitive issues that may need to be dealt with that observers may have failed to directly notify to the project manager or NOSS facilitator. The analyst in particular should frequently ascertain that the incoming data provide sufficient information so that an informative and representative report can eventually be produced. Conducting NOSS observations and completing rich observation reports over an extended period requires a very high level of observer motivation and dedication. The motivation element must be continually fostered and nurtured throughout the process. The leadership and interpersonal skills of the project manager (and NOSS facilitator) are key to achieving positive results in this area. Overall the responsibility for supporting the observers and maintaining their motivation throughout the observations falls on the project manager. The project manager should act as a mentor and provide channels for open and honest two-way communications with the team. The project manager should be responsive to the observersâ€™ needs and act quickly to resolve any issues. Sound planning and preparation are the key elements in making a NOSS successful and productive. Well-supported and motivated observers are the key to a successful end result.
