According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Normal Operations Safety Survey (NOSS) manual, the observer training usually takes no more than five consecutive days and is done in a group. The training is typically provided by the NOSS facilitator and/or the project manager. The first two days are spent in a classroom environment. Test observations (including report writing) are done on day three and day four. On day five the facilitator provides feedback to the individual observers about the content of the reports they have provided. After this feedback the observers normally are ready to conduct their actual observations. During the first “solo” observations the facilitator may continue to provide feedback to observers as and when required.
