The observers must not record the names of the individuals at the working positions in the operational environment where the NOSS is conducted. All that is to be recorded is the name of the sector or position that is observed and the start and end times of the observation. The observation form that the observer fills out may contain a code number by which the facilitator can identify the observer, but the observer's name must not be recorded on the form. This guarantees that other persons who see the forms (e.g. during data verification) will not know who wrote the form or who was working the position at the time of the observation.
