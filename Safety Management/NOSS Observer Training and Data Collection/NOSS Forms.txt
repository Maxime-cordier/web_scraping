After conducting an observation, the observers fill out a structured form to summarize the events that occurred during the observation. The information recorded on this form should convey what was seen to readers who were not present during the observation, and should consist of factual statements. The use of evaluative or judgemental expressions should be avoided. Observation reports should be written up immediately after conducting the observation, at a location other than where the observation was conducted. Care should be taken to avoid writing any information in the observation report that could be used to identify the individuals who were controlling traffic during the observation(s).
