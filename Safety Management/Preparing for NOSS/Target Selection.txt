For most ATS providers, conducting a NOSS in the entire operational environment will not be feasible as NOSS is designed to capture data in a selected part of the operation over a limited period of time. Therefore an ATS provider should determine early on in the project which specific part of the operation will be the target for the NOSS. A NOSS that covers a large array of operations may highlight more general issues, but by focusing on smaller units of analysis (e.g. conducting a NOSS within an ACC as opposed to across multiple ACCs), more detailed information about the operating environment will be captured. Results from earlier trials indicate that organisations that do not try to cast too wide a net can maximize the information derived from the NOSS that can be used during the safety change process. After conducting a NOSS in a specific area of the operation an ATS provider may decide to target a different area for another NOSS, thus potentially covering the entire operational environment over a number of years.
