During the data collection period, which to the operational staff in an ATS provider is the most visible part of a NOSS, the role of the observers is more than just that of collecting the data. Because of their proximity to the staff at the operational positions, the observers also become the “face of NOSS” in that period. Even though observers are not expected to interact with the controllers they observe, it is inevitable that some questions will be asked by the operational staff before the observation is conducted, or immediately after. Those interchanges are usually about the purpose of the observations, or the NOSS methodology in general, and may contribute significantly to the understanding and acceptance of the observation process by the workforce. It is therefore prudent to keep that aspect in mind when selecting the candidate observers for a NOSS. Attributes of suitable candidates to be selected as NOSS observers include: Observers who are not rated at the working position they observe usually produce better reports than observers who are rated at that position. An explanation for this may be that rated observers tend to become absorbed in the technical details at the working position more than non-rated observers do. Non-rated observers, in contrast, tend to focus more on the situation as a whole at the working position, which in essence is what a NOSS is looking for. Observers’ “Code of Conduct” There are generic guidelines that must be kept in mind when formulating rules of conducting the NOSS:
