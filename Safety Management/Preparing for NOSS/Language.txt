One of the NOSS trials was held in a State where English is not the first language. This did not present any problems since the level of conversational English within the observer group was high. However, it was suggested after the trial that perhaps the observer reports might have been of an even higher quality if they could have been written in the native language of the participants. Any ATS provider can of course opt to conduct a NOSS in the local language, as long as it is realised that a decision to translate the NOSS supporting material may have implications for external support, coding and potentially also for benchmarking of the NOSS results with other organisations.
