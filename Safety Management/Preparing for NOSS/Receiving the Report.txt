While areas of strength are easy for the organisation to accept, areas of unexpected weakness can potentially cause an overreaction if not properly managed. The NOSS report is merely a diagnostic overview of what is occurring during normal operations and does not indicate solutions. For meaningful safety change to occur, the organisation must determine why particular patterns of threats, errors and undesired states are occurring. To ensure that the maximum benefit is gained from a NOSS report, the organisation must prepare well in advance. At that stage the following points should be considered with the final report in mind: What does the organisation hope to achieve from NOSS? The organisation must be clear about the outcome that is sought and be confident that their expectations are realistic.. Is senior management prepared for unexpected and possibly undesired findings?. Do any groups within the organisation have strong negative agendas that could be boosted by the NOSS findings? The NOSS findings should always be seen as enlightening to all levels of the organisation and never as a political tool.. Is the organisation prepared to share all findings, good and bad, with staff?. Is the organisation committed to addressing issues highlighted by the NOSS?.
