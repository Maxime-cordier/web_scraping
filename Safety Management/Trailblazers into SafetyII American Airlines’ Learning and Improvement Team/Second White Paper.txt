A second white paper, "Charting a New Aproach: What Goes Well and Why at American Airlines," was published in September 2021. The second paper describes the work of the LIT in the year since the publication of the first paper and accomplishes three mutually reinforcing goals: To document the actions taken and decisions made when validating the initial flightdeck observations as related to the LIT language and coding.. To share the analysis and early observations from the dataset.. To offer insights into the value of a Safety-II effort in any organization and some of the developmental and growth challenges LIT encountered. AA LIT welcomes all feedback on our papers (Bogomir.Glavan@aa.com, Nicholas.Peterson@aa.com). We are happy to discuss our experience and efforts and send an open invitation to any organization, aviation or other, to reach out.
