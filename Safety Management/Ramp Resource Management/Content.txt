Previous studies performed in the area of ramp handling reveal that the target group considers personal factors (time pressure, stress, fatigue, peer pressure and motivation) and communication important factors in accident and incident causation during the aircraft turnaround. To address these issues in such a way that GSP and individual workers gain the maximum benefit, the syllabus has been designed in modules; each module covering a different subject: The modules can be used separately.

Also, RRM training aims at providing trainees with insight and changing attitudes towards safety. It is very difficult to achieve this through, for example, a one-hour course. Therefore it is recommended to provide at least four-hours training, which is the designed duration of the RRM syllabus. Of course, content can be changed or added where local situations require this.
