Not long ago the safety monitoring processes relied mainly on staff identifying existing or potential risks and hazards by using their best judgement, experience and skills. Often if unsafe practices are used regularly as a normal method of operation, it is very likely that personnel involved in these activities would not recognise the actual and potential threats. The need to improve the control of human error and develop countermeasures to error in operational environments lead to the introduction of observation-based methods, such as LOSA and NOSS and data analysis programmes, such as FDA. These methods are used to systematically capture data which reflect actual day-to-day performance and provide proactive means for safety monitoring and improvement.
