Regulatory requirements related to safety management and implementation of an SMS mandate aviation service providers to develop and maintain the means to verify the safety performance of the organisation. Safety performance monitoring and measurement enables continuous monitoring and regular assessment of the safety levels achieved by an organisation during service delivery. The safety performance shall be verified in reference to the safety policy and approved safety objectives (safety performance targets) using dedicated safety performance indicators (SPIs). Trends should be analysed and, consequently, corrective actions should be identified after detecting any deterioration of specified safety levels. Safety monitoring could be an important source of information for measuring the effective functioning of other SMS components. According to EUROCONTROL ESARR4 - Risk Assessment and Mitigation in ATM, safety monitoring and data collection mechanisms could be specifically developed and used for the validation of the safety assumptions and requirements identified in the risk assessment and mitigation processes, as well as for the validation of safety models used in risk management. Also, safety monitoring and data collection support the development of safety indicators at national, regional and global level.
