All air navigation services, including air traffic flow management and airspace management use functional systems that enable the management of air traffic. Therefore any changes to functional systems should be subject to formal evaluation and risk assessment. In Europe, Regulation 1035/2011 laying down common requirements for the provision of air navigation services (see further reading), requires that an traffic services provider conducts systematically hazard identification as well as risk assessment and mitigation for any changes to those parts of the ATM functional system and supporting arrangements within his managerial control. This formal process shall cover: the complete life cycle of the constituent part of the ATM functional system under consideration;. the airborne, ground and, if appropriate, spatial components of the ATM functional system;. the equipment, procedures and human resources of the ATM functional system, the interactions between these elements and the interactions between the constituent part under consideration and the remainder of the ATM functional system.. Any changes to ATM functional systems should be subject to a safety oversight by the national supervisory authorities. (See also "Change Management in ATM Operations")
