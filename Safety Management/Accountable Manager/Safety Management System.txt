Where a Safety Management System is in place, the managerial organogram will reflect this pattern of internal accountability to the Accountable Manager and evidence the lead overall responsibility of the Accountable Managers themselves. ICAO Doc 9859, Safety Management Manual, uses the term "accountable executive," which is defined as: "A single, identifiable person having responsibility for the effective and efficient performance of the service provider's SMS."
