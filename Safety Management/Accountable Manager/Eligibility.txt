An Accountable Manager must be the person with overall executive responsibility for the operation of the regulated organisation. In many cases, this will mean a person who also sits on the Board of the Company or on the equivalent non corporate body, but in the case of a very large organisation embracing more than one individually regulated unit, it may be that the internal line of accountability to the Company Board or equivalent is through a more senior member of such a body. In this case, a separately-designated Accountable Manager will be required for each separately-regulated operating entity. Any Accountable Manager designation required by a Regulatory Authority is likely to require submission for approval by that Authority. The Regulatory Authority will usually be the National Aviation Authority (NAA) It is unlikely that an Accountable Manager will hold any current role involving technical specialism(s) within their organisation, although they may have held such a role in the past.
