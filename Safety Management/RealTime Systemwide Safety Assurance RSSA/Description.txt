As envisioned by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), a real-time systemwide safety assurance (RSSA) is needed to provide a continuum of information, analysis and assessment that supports awareness and action to mitigate risks to safety. According to a 2018 report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, NASAâ€™s research plans state that development of an RSSA system for the national airspace system (NAS) will necessitate automating safety assurance of air transportation system components, integrating component-level systems, and reducing the safety assurance cycle time until real-time safety assurance is achieved at the system-of-systems level. The safety assurance system will combine air traffic and onboard aircraft technologies as well as automated data mining capabilities for continuous safety monitoring and threat prediction.
