ESARR 3 mandates the implementation and use of Safety Management Systems (SMS) by providers of air traffic management (ATM) services. It has been transposed into EU law by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1035/2011 of 17 October 2011 laying down common requirements for the provision of air navigation services that was repealed by Regulation 2017/373 - Requirements for providers of ATM/air navigation services and other ATM network functions and their oversight. The main components of an ATM service provider's SMS meeting ESARR 3 requirements may be assigned to the following broad domains: Safety Policy and Planning. Safety Achievement. Safety Assurance. Safety Promotion. An organisational safety effort cannot succeed just by the mechanic implementation of the referred SMS components and procedures. An effective SMS is build taking due account of the interaction between these components with the human element of the aviation system. A successful implementation and operation of an SMS is highly dependent on organisational aspects such as individual and group attitudes, values, competencies and patterns of behaviour which are frequently referred to as elements of the “safety culture”. A positive safety culture is characterised by a shared awareness of organisations’ personnel of the importance of safety in their operational tasks.
