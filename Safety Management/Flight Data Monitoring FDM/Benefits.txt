FDM strongly contributes to increased flight safety and operational efficiency by: Providing data to help in the prevention of incidents and accidents. Fewer flight accidents not only reduce material losses and insurance costs, but also keep passengers' confidence high.. Improved operational insight: providing the means to identify potential risks and to modify pilot training programs accordingly.. Improved fuel consumption: FDM provides the ability to identify and make adjustments to company operating procedures or specific aircraft with unusually high fuel burn rates.. Reduction in unnecessary maintenance and repairs: FDM data can be used to help reduce the need for unscheduled maintenance, resulting in lower maintenance costs and increased aircraft availability.. Improved ground conditions and airports: in certain cases, airlines can use the data captured from their FDM program to support requested changes to air traffic control and airport procedures.. Reduced number of ACARS messages: non-critical data (e.g. take-off reports, stable cruise reports) that are sent via ACARS messages, can be acquired, recorded and transmitted via flight data monitoring equipment. Reduced reliance on flight data recorders: flight-monitoring data can be transmitted automatically over the Internet and be analyzed without delay.. Adherence to noise restrictions: flight data monitoring helps airlines demonstrate adherence to noise restrictions in terms of being able to verify or deny actual infringement, and avoid incurring fines.. Improved monitoring of flight crew's cosmic radiation exposure: flight data monitoring can assist in tracking radiation exposure. Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) programmes provide a powerful tool for the proactive hazard identification..
