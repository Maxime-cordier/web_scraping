The recommended format presented below has been extracted from Annex 13, Appendix to Chapter 6. Additional guidance for completing each section of the Final Report can be found in ICAO Doc 6920 - Manual of Aircraft Accident Investigation. One notable area where the recommended format is widely ignored, even by otherwise reputable agencies, is that 'Personnel Information' is rarely given for any directly involved person except flight crew even when their actions have been found to have had much more bearing on the outcome of the event investigated than those of the flight crew.
