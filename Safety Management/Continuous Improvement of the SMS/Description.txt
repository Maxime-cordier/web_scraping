According to ICAO Doc 9859 - Safety Management Manual this is one of the three elements of the safety assurance component of the SMS. Assurance builds on the principle of the continuous improvement cycle. In much the same way that quality assurance facilitates continuous improvements in quality, safety assurance ensures control of safety performance, including regulatory compliance, through constant verification and improvement of the operational system and services. These objectives are achieved through the application of similar tools: internal evaluations and independent audits (both internal and external), strict document control and ongoing monitoring of safety controls and mitigation actions.
