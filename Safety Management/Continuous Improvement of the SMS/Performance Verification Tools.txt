Internal evaluations involve the evaluation of the operational activities of the organisation as well as the SMS-specific functions. The evaluations must be conducted by persons or organisations that are functionally independent of the technical process being evaluated (i.e. a specialist safety or quality assurance department or another unit as directed by senior management). The internal evaluation function also requires auditing and evaluation of safety management functions, policymaking, safety risk management, safety assurance and safety promotion. These audits provide the management officials designated responsibility for the SMS to inventory the processes of the SMS itself. Internal audits are an important tool for managers, used to obtain information with which to make decisions and to keep operational activities on track. Thus internal audits are an essential tool for safety assurance, to help managers in charge of activities supporting the delivery of services to control that, once safety risk controls have been implemented, they continue to perform and are effective in maintaining continuing operational safety. External audits of the SMS may be conducted by the regulator, code-share partners, customer organisations, or other third parties selected by the organisation or the regulator, for example a Qualified Entity. These audits not only provide a strong interface with the oversight system but also a secondary assurance system.
