The International Air Transport Association (IATA) established the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) Programme, now internationally recognised and accepted, as an evaluation system designed to assess the operational management and control systems of an airline. The aims of the IOSA programme are: IOSA is based on industry-proven quality audit principles, and is designed to ensure that each audit is conducted in a standardised manner to achieve consistent results. All IATA members are IOSA-registered and must remain registered to maintain IATA membership. Conversely, IATA membership is not a requirement to undergo an IOSA audit. According to IATA, there are dozens of airlines on the IOSA registry that are not IATA members.
