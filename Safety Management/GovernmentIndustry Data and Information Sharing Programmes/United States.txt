One of the longest running and, arguably, most successful government/industry partnership is the U.S. Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST), which was established in 1997. CAST’s initial goal was to reduce the commercial aviation fatality risk in the United States by 80 percent from 1998 to 2008. By 2008, CAST was able to report that by implementing the most promising safety enhancements, the fatality risk of commercial air travel in the United States was reduced by 83 percent. CAST’s goal over the next decade is to transition to prognostic safety analysis. CAST aims to reduce the remaining U.S. commercial fatality risk by 50 percent from 2010 to 2025 and to continue to work with our international partners to reduce fatality risk in worldwide commercial aviation. The Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing Program (ASIAS) connects a wide variety of safety data and information sources across government and industry, including voluntarily provided safety data. ASIAS works closely with CAST and the General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) to monitor known risk, evaluate the effectiveness of deployed mitigations, and detect emerging risk. ASIAS currently has nearly 50 large airline members, as well as participation by dozens of business aviation operators, universities, manufacturers and repair stations.
