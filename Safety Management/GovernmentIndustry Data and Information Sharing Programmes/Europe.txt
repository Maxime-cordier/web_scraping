Data4Safety (D4S) is a data collection and analysis programme that aims at collecting and gathering data that support the management of safety risks at the European level. This includes, but is not limited to, safety reports (or occurrence reports), flight data (i.e., data generated by the aircraft via the flight data recorders), surveillance data and weather data. The programme is intended to allow stakeholders to better identify risks, determine the nature of these risks, and verify whether safety actions or mitigations are delivering the needed level of safety. The programme also aims to develop the capability of discovering vulnerabilities in the system across terabytes of data. D4S is, in essence, a collaborative partnership programme, or a public-private partnership between public bodies like the European Union Aviation Safety Agency or national aviation authorities and the private sector (e.g., airlines and manufacturers) that aims at inferring safety intelligence. This is done by organising a massive collection of safety data and organising the analytical capacity amongst all European aviation safety system stakeholders. D4S is currently in the proof-of-concept phase, which involves a limited number of stakeholders and is intended to confirm the expected benefits while testing the programmeâ€™s technical and governance models. D4S is expected to enter its operational phase in 2020. This article will be updated with details on more programmes as information becomes available.
