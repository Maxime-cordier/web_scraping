At the international regional level ICAO’s Regional Aviation Safety Groups (RASGs) serve as a regional cooperative forum integrating global, regional, sub-regional, national and industry efforts in continuing to enhance aviation safety. RASGs develop and implement work programmes that support a regional performance framework for the management of safety on the basis of GASP. RASGs build on the work already done by states, and other sub-regional entities. The following RASGs have been established: Regional Aviation Safety Group – Europe (RASG-EUR);. Regional Aviation Safety Group – Asia Pacific (RASG-APAC);. Regional Aviation Safety Group – Africa (RASG-AFI);. Regional Aviation Safety Group – Middle East (RASG-MID); and,. Regional Aviation Safety Group – Pan America (RASG-PA)..
