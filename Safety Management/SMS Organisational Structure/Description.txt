Fundamental to a successful safety management is the application of a systems approach based on established safety policy, safety planning and a dedicated organisational structure. The effective organisational structure requires unambiguous definition and description of safety management roles, accountabilities and responsibilities of management and personnel involved in safety related tasks. Several important considerations must be taken into account by operators/service providers when establishing the SMS structure: Note: Responsibility and accountability are closely related concepts. Safety responsibility is delegated within the area of job responsibilities, provided such delegation is documented. Safety accountabilities define to whom the responsible person needs to demonstrate the satisfactory discharge of their safety responsibilities. There is no single solution for the establishment of a coherent SMS structure. The size of the organisation, its mission, complexity of operations, operating environment and its organisational safety culture will all influence the structure and functioning of its safety management system. Any changes to the organisational structure should be assessed to determine whether they might have any effect on safety responsibilities and accountabilities. Any necessary amendments to previous responsibilities and accountabilities should be properly documented.
