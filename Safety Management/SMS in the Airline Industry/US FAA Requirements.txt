The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) website, as of 2021, defines SMS, and cites the national policy order and regulatory requirements for FAA and U.S. Part 121 air carriers to implement an SMS. Governing the FAA’s own airline-oversight practices, “SMS is the formal, top-down, organization-wide approach to managing safety risk and assuring the effectiveness of safety risk controls. It includes systematic procedures, practices, and policies for the management of safety risk.” (FAA National Policy Order 8000.369C, Safety Management System, June 24, 2020). The same definition applies to airline SMSs in the SMS Part 5 regulation, and the relationship functions as follows: The FAA regards SMS as a critical element of its regulatory authority and safety oversight responsibility regarding increasingly diverse aviation product/service providers, including “airports, manufacturers, operators [e.g., air carriers in this article], maintenance organizations, training organizations, air traffic service providers, and others;” and,. FAA emphasises, however, that its SMS expectations for Part 121 air carriers avoid prescriptive, one-size-fits-all checklists. Instead, the agency’s guidance to these airlines says, “SMS Part 5 specifies a basic set of processes integral to an effective SMS but does not specify particular methods for implementing these processes. … This design is intentional, in that the FAA expects each air carrier to develop an SMS that works for its unique operation. … These methods, however, are not the only means of compliance.”. The basic set of processes in SMS Part 5 — the rule titled Safety Management Systems for Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental Operations Certificate Holders — focuses on these components: Safety policy;. Safety risk management;. Safety assurance;. Safety promotion; and,. SMS documentation and record keeping..
