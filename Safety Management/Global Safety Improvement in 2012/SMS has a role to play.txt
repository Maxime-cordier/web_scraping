A great deal of work continues on further improving safety in Europe through the European Plan for Aviation Safety (EPAS), which is managed by EASA and the European Aviation Safety Programme (EASP), which is a high-level document managed by the European Commission. The synergy of these two documents working together provide the basis of the European safety management system (SMS). The present plan, which covers the four‐year period between 2012 and 2015, is now in its third issue with the first plan having been issued in 2010. The key safety risks addressed in the EPAS are determined and identified through the following ways: The analysis of safety issues raised by the National Aviation Authorities (NAA),. The analysis of EASA’s safety data along with analysis carried out by the European Network of Analysts (NoA).. The NoA brings together safety analysis departments based in EASA Member State NAAs and Investigation Authorities in order to analyse safety risks and issues at the European Level. The EPAS also connects the identified safety issues with the actions and initiatives that have been launched to address the underlying risks. Solutions are developed by a range of organisations and groups in the European Aviation Community.
