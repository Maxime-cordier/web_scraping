Defining the scope and boundaries of the Safety Case is an essential first step in the development of the Safety Case. It should explain what the Safety Case covers (and does not cover), boundaries of responsibility with respect to managerial control and other stakeholders, applicability and compliance with safety regulations and standards and any assumption made in defining the scope, boundaries or safety criteria. A Safety Case may be temporarily restricted to the safety of a new concept, and therefore be conditional on the subsequent complete and correct implementation of that concept by the responsible organisation. Such Safety case is classified as Preliminary Safety Case. It should be supported by guidance material for the subsequent implementation of the Safety Requirements and for the development of a full Safety Case.
