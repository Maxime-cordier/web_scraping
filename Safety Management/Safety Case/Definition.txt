A Safety Case is the documented assurance, including argument and supporting evidence, of the achievement and maintenance of safety. The development of a Safety Case is not an alternative to carrying out a Safety Assessment. It is a means of structuring and documenting a summary of the results of a Safety Assessment, and other activities (e.g. simulations, surveys etc.), in a way that a reader can readily follow the logical reasoning as to why a change (or ongoing service) can be considered safe.
