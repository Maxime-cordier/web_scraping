Safety Cases may come in many forms, but most can be thought of as falling into one of the two categories, as follows: Unit Safety Case: an Air Traffic Services Unit (or other major, safety-related service/facility) may decide to produce and maintain a Unit Safety Case (USC) in order to show that the on-going, day-to-day operations are safe and that they will remain so indefinitely. An USC would include typically an a priori safety assessment, together with the results of safety audits, surveys and operational monitoring. Project Safety Case: an Air Traffic Services Unit (or other responsible organisation) may also decide to produce a Project Safety Case (PSC) when a particular substantial change to an existing safety-related service/systems to be undertaken. A PSC would normally consider only those risks created or modified by the change and rely on an assumption (or evidence from the corresponding USC) that the pre-change situation is at least tolerably safe.
