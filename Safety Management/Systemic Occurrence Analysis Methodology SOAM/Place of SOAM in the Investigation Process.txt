The main focus of SOAM is on two key phases of the investigation process: These activities are distinct from, but follow logically from: In using SOAM, the preparation of a final chart of contributing factors and the development of recommendations are activities which are best conducted "manually" by the investigator(s), rather than with the aid of a software or database tool. However, the output of findings and recommendations produced using SOAM is suitable for subsequent uploading into a tool like SOFIA. This has the benefit of clearly separating the very distinct investigation activities of event reconstruction, causal analysis and preparation of recommendations. Recommendations from a SOAM-based investigation will be directed towards remediation of contributing systemic factors and failed barriers, a process that is not dependent on an exhaustive analysis of underlying cognitive error mechanisms.
