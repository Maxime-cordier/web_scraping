A safety record is any information, which can be used to support a safety claim and demonstrate the degree of acceptability of the safety performance of the services provided by an organisation. Safety records are to be created and maintained throughout the SMS operation. Appropriate procedures should determine their format and, in each case, specify the form in which records have to be made and who is responsible for ensuring that this is done. Safety records could be perceived as a negative and bureaucratic element. However, safety records are needed not only to demonstrate that SMS is operating but also to provide data and traceability which can be used to identify and solve actual safety problems. The information items building the list of safety records in an organisation will depend on the scale and complexity of the operations. As the scale of operation increases more items will be put on this list. Some records may be qualitative, for example training records, safety analyses, etc. Other may be quantitative, for example statistics derived as a result of safety monitoring. There is a need to identify the safety records to be kept for each SMS process, ensuring that only those critical to safety are maintained. Also, international or national regulations and standards may require specific safety records as a basis for providing regulators with safety assurance. The effort that goes into record keeping should be balanced against the value of data. In particular, special effort should be made to ensure proper recording and documenting of safety assurance processes (safety surveys, safety monitoring). One should not confuse safety records with recorded operational safety data, such as communications between pilots and controllers. ‘Safety records’ is the documented output of the safety management processes and activities, such as: Safety records should be maintained in sufficient detail to ensure traceability of all safety-related decisions.
