The Basic Aviation Risk Standard Program (BARS Program) was developed by the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) in conjunction with the onshore resource sector to provide a system of oversight for the contracted aviation sector. The program consists of four key elements: a risk based Standard, the audit Program, Training and Data analysis. The program has expanded to also support government, humanitarian, and offshore operations and corporate and insurance sectors in their management of risk associated with aviation activities.
