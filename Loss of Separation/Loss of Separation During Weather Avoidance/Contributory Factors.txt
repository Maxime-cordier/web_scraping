Surprise – the first adverse weather avoidance action of a subsequent sequence may be unexpected by the controller;. Traffic complexity - and the corresponding controller workload - is increased due to the non-standard routes being used and the dynamic conflict points;. Communication – safe operations during weather avoidance require increased air-ground (with pilots) and ground-ground (with adjacent sectors) communication;. Frequency congestion - may be caused by the significant increase in air-ground communication exchange;. Unpredictable avoidance manoeuvres – different airlines have different SOPs regarding weather avoidance..
