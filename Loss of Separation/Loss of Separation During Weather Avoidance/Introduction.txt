This article provides a general overview for controllers of some typical scenarios involving loss of separation (LOS) during weather avoidance. It offers some suggestions to help controllers provide as much support as possible to the aircraft concerned and considerations for maintaining the safety of other aircraft in the vicinity of the potential conflict. In the context of this article, the term ‘weather avoidance’ is used to describe avoiding actions taken by a pilot to circumnavigate weather which may be considered by the pilot in command to be prejudicial to either the safety of their aircraft or to the comfort of its passengers such as a Thunderstorm, Cumulonimbus (Cb) (CB) or Towering Cumulus (TCU) cloud and the severe turbulence and hail which may be associated with them. There is no set of ready, out-of-the-box rules which can be universally applied. Controllers should aim to exercise their best judgment when dealing with LOS risks. The advice and illustrations provided in this article are not intended to be exhaustive and should not prejudice the application of local ATC procedures.
