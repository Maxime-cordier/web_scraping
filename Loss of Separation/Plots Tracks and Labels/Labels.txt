Labels can be attached to both plots and tracks but plot labels contain less information. When correlated with a flight plan, track labels contain much more information and become more interactable (i.e. the controller is able to input the clearances issued to the aircraft). Also, CPDLC is generally performed using the fields in the correlated label. Note that flight plans are only correlated with tracks and not plots. Labels can be moved around so that they do not overlap. Some systems have automated decluttering feature that tries to rearrange the labels without controller input. The contents of the label depend on the ATS system design but some common principles are followed: Example of a track and an aircraft label, containing callsign, current Flight level, climb indicator (arrow), Ground speed, Cleared flight level and eXit flight level.
