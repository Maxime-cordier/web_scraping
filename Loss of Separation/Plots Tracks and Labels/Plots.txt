Plots are obtained from surveillance data using a plot extractor. This is a device (or an algorithm) that processes the raw data from a surveillance sensor. The plot extractor needs to distinguish target data (aircraft) from: Depending on the sensor plots can be primary (coming from a PSR), secondary (coming from an SSR) or combined (when a primary and a secondary plot are considered to be from the same aircraft). Primary plots provide only 2-D position information (unless the radar has the ability to determine the level of the targets but this is rarely the case in civilian ATS). Secondary plots add SSR code and aircraft level (if mode C information is available).
