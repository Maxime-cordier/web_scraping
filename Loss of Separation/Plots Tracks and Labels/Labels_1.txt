Labels can be attached to both plots and tracks but plot labels contain less information. When correlated with a flight plan, track labels contain much more information and become more interactable (i.e. the controller is able to input the clearances issued to the aircraft). Also, CPDLC is generally performed using the fields in the correlated label. Note that flight plans are only correlated with tracks and not plots. Labels can be moved around so that they do not overlap. Some systems have automated decluttering feature that tries to rearrange the labels without controller input. The contents of the label depend on the ATS system design but some common principles are followed: Labels need to be concise, i.e. contain all important information while at the same time are not superfluous. These requirements are somewhat exclusive which is usually solved by having two versions of the label - simple (basic information) and extended (full information). Switching between the two requires little effort from the controller (e.g. hovering the cursor over a simple label converts it into an extended one and moving the cursor away auto-shrinks it). The most common shape is a rectangle consisting of several rows (usually between 2 and 5). Each row contains one or more data fields.. ICAO Doc 4444 requires that the label includes information relating to the identity of the aircraft (e.g. the SSR code or the callsign). This information is usually presented in the top row, and in the leftmost data field (if there is more than one of those).. Labels are associated (connected) with their position indications in a manner that makes it easy for the controller to understand which track the information refers to. This is an ICAO Doc 4444 requirement. It is usually met by linking the label and the corresponding track symbol using a line called "leader line".. ICAO Doc 4444 requires that level information (pressure-derived) is displayed, if available. It may be obtained from a Transponder and/or from Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B). In addition, information for climb or descent is provided in most cases in the form of an arrow next to the level information.. While SSR codes may not be visible at all times, clear indication that emergency codes (7500, 7600, 7700) are selected is presented on the situational display. This may either be done by displaying the codes themselves or by a short warning message (usually above) the aircraft label. Dedicated colour (e.g. red) may be used to highlight the code/message or the entire label to draw the controller's attention.. Correlated labels may be presented in different colours to help the controller build and maintain situational awareness. Examples of this may be the labels of aircraft on the frequency, those who are expected to enter area of responsibility (AoR), those that have been instructed to contact the next sector (or unit), the ones that are passing near, but are not going to enter, etc.. Labels for flights on the frequency usually have interactable fields so that controllers can
