The main difference between surveillance-based control and procedural control is the way the controller builds and maintains a picture of the air situation. Note that, by definition, the use of procedural control does not mean that surveillance data is not available at all nor does it preclude the use of such data. However, this is only to be done for enhancing the controllers' situational awareness and is by no means intended (or allowed) to assist in providing separation between aircraft. The methods that can be used for separation provision are explicitly stated in local instructions (e.g. manuals of operations). The main tool in procedural control is Flight Progress Strips. Controllers use these in order to: Strips being in the same strip bay are then sorted by some criteria, e.g. estimated time, level, etc. Aircraft position determination and position updates are made by either pilot reports or visual observations, the latter being applicable in the CTR or on the manoeuvring area by tower and ground controllers. Position reports are also used to update the estimates for next points on the route. Position estimates are then used to determine if there is a conflict between aircraft being at the same level and also for issuing clearances for level changes.
