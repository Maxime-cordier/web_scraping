Procedural separation is to be provided during procedural control. Traffic on the manoeuvring area is usually separated by use of standard positions that have been assessed to provide adequate spacing. A typical example is the holding point of a taxiway. An aircraft is supposed to proceed after such a point only after obtaining an explicit clearance (including a conditional one). Aerodrome lighting may also be used for this purpose. For complex aerodromes, specific holding points are defined before crossing other taxiways. The following methods are usually used for en-route procedural control: The methods above are also applicable for other ATS units providing procedural control. Also, aerodrome controllers may provide reduced separation provided that each aircraft is continuously visible to them. For example, an aerodrome controller may clear an aircraft to cross above a runway at a right angle after a departing traffic has passed the intersecting point of the two flight paths.
