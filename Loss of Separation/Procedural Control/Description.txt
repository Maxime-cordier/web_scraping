The general principles of air traffic control are the same regardless of whether procedural or surveillance methods are used (i.e. the controller monitors the traffic situations, detects and solves conflicts by providing separation, and ensures orderly flow of the air traffic). The difference lies in the way situational awareness is built and updated (by pilot reports, estimates and visual observation), the separation minima themselves (as described in ICAO Doc 4444, Chapter 5) and the support tools (flight strips instead of a situational display).
