Typical applications of procedural control include: In airspace where surveillance cover is not available (e.g. oceanic airspace or sparsely populated areas). In terminal movement areas (TMAs) if the traffic levels are such that they do not warrant the installation and maintenance of a surveillance system. In aerodrome control zones (CTRs), especially if the traffic density is relatively low and the aerodrome layout is not complex (e.g. only one runway, one apron and a few taxiways). Backup solution in case of complete failure of all surveillance-based systems.
