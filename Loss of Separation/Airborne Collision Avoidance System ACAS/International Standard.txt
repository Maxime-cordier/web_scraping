The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is responsible for the global standardisation of ACAS based on the Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) prepared by RTCA and EUROCAE. ACAS equipment is available from four vendors (ACSS, Garmin, Honeywell, Rockwell Collins). While each vendorâ€™s implementation is slightly different, they provide the same core functions and the collision avoidance and coordination logic contained in each implementation is the same. In order to be certified, ACAS equipment must meet the Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) laid down in RTCA and EUROCAE documents. TCAS II version 7.1 Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) have been published by RTCA as DO-185B and by EUROCAE as ED-143.
