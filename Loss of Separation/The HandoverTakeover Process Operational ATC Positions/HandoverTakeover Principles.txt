The procedures for handover-takeover are usually different depending on the workplace (TWR, APP or ACC) and vary significantly from one ANSP to another. There are however some common principles that are adopted in most cases: Handover commences in "clean" situations, i.e. there is no emergency or abnormal situation developing and the conflicts are either solved or a plan for their resolution has been made.. The relieving controller is supposed to arrive earlier and the relieved controller is supposed to remain near the working position until they are certain that the new controller's situational awareness is at the desired level.. Check-lists are used so that vital information is not neglected or omitted.. The handover-takeover process is not supposed to coincide with a change of the ATC sector configuration..
