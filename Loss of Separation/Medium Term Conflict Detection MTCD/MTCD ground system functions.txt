Within the MTCD application several functions are identified at the level of the ground system: Trajectory prediction: responsible for creating, in the system, future trajectories for each aircraft/target. (Note: due to performance requirements the system may be required to compute more than one single future trajectory for each aircraft/target);. Conflict detection: responsible for identifying in the system potentially conflicting trajectories. Potentially conflicting trajectories are those trajectories for which the future position of 2 or more aircraft might fall below specified minima (not necessary the separation minima), given the uncertainty in the prediction;. Trajectory update: responsible for updating in the system the predicted trajectories whenever this occurs â€“ this functions is performed following an external input (i.e. human intervention) or due to a change in aircraft trajectory and/or automatic integration of detected aircraft position;. Trajectory edition: responsible for allowing the human interaction with the predicted trajectory of one or more aircraft/targets..
