Improvements in ATS mean that with one exception - large parts of the ICAO Africa Indian Ocean (AFI) Region - TIBA procedures are now more likely to be encountered as temporary rather than long term arrangements. The AFI situation has been dealt for many years now by promulgation of the IATA In-Flight Broadcast Procedure (IFBP), which is endorsed by ICAO. The IATA AFI IFBP advises the application of IFBP when flying in any of the following group of contiguous FIRs in Africa using frequency 126.9 MHz: Asmara. Brazzaville. Kano. Khartoum. Kinshasa. Luanda. Mogadishu. Niamey. N'Djamena. Tripoli. IATA regularly reviews whether the included FIRs remain appropriate and notifies any changes to them. It is noted that the Libyan authorities have mandated IFBP throughout the Tripoli FIR i.e. to include that part of it north of 30° N. Other applications by IATA of their IFBP procedure have included in the Yangon FIR (Myanmar) since 2003 due to numerous reports indicating that Myanmar’s fixed and mobile communications had been operating below the appropriate level of reliability. TIBA as a contingency measure was briefly implemented in New Zealand after the 2011 earthquake which resulted in the evacuation of the Christchurch ACC and the procedure has been used on various occasions in Australia since 2008 due to temporary controller shortages and more recently in Class G airspace within the Kota Kinabalu FIR (Malaysia).
