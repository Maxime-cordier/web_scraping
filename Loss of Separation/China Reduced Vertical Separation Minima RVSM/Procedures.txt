To ensure compliance, the operator shall ensure that the pilot has been trained on China RVSM Flight Level Allocation Scheme (FLAS) before operating in China airspace. Procedures for the RVSM airspace include (but are not limited to): Equipment - Altimeters must allow the aircraft to be flown in feet. Aircraft must be equipped with: two primary altimetry systems one automatic altitude-keeping device; and one altitude-alerting device.. two primary altimetry systems. one automatic altitude-keeping device; and. one altitude-alerting device.. Clearance - Altitude clearances will be provided in metres. Conversion - Pilots will convert the cleared altitude in metres to feet using ONLY an approved China RVSM Conversion Table. As some rounding of values has been incorporated into the table, using any other means to convert values can lead to compromised vertical separation between aircraft.. Execution - The value in feet, as extracted from the conversion table, is the flight level to be flown. Note that aircraft with both feet and metric altimeters MUST NOT fly the cleared level in metres. The conversion MUST be made and the aircraft flown referencing feet..
