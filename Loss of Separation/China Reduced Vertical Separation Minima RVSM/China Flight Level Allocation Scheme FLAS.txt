The China FLAS was designed to satisfy their military requirements of applying metric flight levels while at the same time mitigating the relatively big altitude difference between RVSM metric flight level and feet flight levels of neighbouring countries. It also eliminates the phenomena of 900 feet vertical separation associated with metric RVSM flight levels and makes the vertical separation between aircraft 1000 feet or more. To accomplish this, clearances are provided in metres, converted using a specific China RVSM table and flown in feet.
