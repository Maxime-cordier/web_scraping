The transition to China RVSM levels will normally happen outside Chinese airspace in the adjacent FIR. When flight planning, pilots or dispatchers should identify the transition area on their proposed route of flight and file the appropriate level change. Note that a clearance to change from ICAO RVSM levels to China RVSM or from China RVSM to ICAO RVSM levels must be received and acknowledged before any level change is executed.
