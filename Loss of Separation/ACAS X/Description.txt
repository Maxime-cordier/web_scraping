The FAA has funded research and development of a new approach to airborne collision avoidance (which has become known as ACAS X - pronounced “Ay-cas eks” rather than “Ay-cas ten") since 2008. This new approach takes advantage of recent advances in ‘dynamic programming’ and other computer science techniques (which were not available when TCAS was first developed) to generate alerts using an off-line optimisation of resolution advisories. It is the intention that ACAS X will eventually replace TCAS II (ACAS II). TCAS II has been in operation for many years and has demonstrated its value in preventing mid-air collisions on numerous occasions. In Europe it is estimated to have reduced the risk of a mid-air collision by a factor of at least about 5.
