The PASS (Performance and Safety Aspects of Short Term Conflict Alerts (STCA), full Study) project was launched by EUROCONTROL in October 2007 and delivered its results in November 2010. Its objective was to study the performance and safety aspects of STCA, including human performance and consideration of interactions between operational use of STCA and Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS). The projectâ€™s finding allowed to establish quantified performance requirements for STCA, and to define a consistent overall concept for ground-based and airborne safety nets.
