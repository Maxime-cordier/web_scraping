routines to increase the number of available levels.. Allocation of levels at the border between RVSM and non-RVSM airspace. Contingency FLAS (often abbreviated as cFLAS). An example of this is the temporary suspension of RVSM operations due to a wide area affected by severe turbulence. In such case, neighbouring ATS units may agree to the use of the available levels (e.g. Unit A would use FL 310, FL 350 and FL 390 and Unit B would use FL 330m FL 370 and FL 410). Having appropriate arrangements in place (e.g. written down in a Letter of agreement) would ease the transition process in such situations..
