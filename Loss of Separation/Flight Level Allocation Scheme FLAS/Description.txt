The flight level allocation scheme (FLAS) sets out the main principles of flight level allocation within a portion of airspace, or at the border between two airspaces. FLAS is described in relevant documents, such as Letters of agreements between ATS units, AIPs, AIMs, etc. The tactical application of similar solutions (e.g. temporary use of opposite flight levels after coodination between two controllers from different units) is not considered as FLAS. The goal of FLAS is to establish basic, robust rules to be followed in order to achieve safe operations in terms of vertical separation. The controllers may, after a successful coordination, deviate from the FLAS (e.g. regarding a particular flight, for a period of time, etc.). Applications of FLAS include:
