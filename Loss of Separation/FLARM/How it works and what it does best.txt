FLARM obtains its own-aircraft position from an internal Global Positioning System (GPS) unit and a barometric sensor and this is updated every second. The data is then broadcast by a low power RF transmitter (868.2 MHz) along with a 30 second projection of likely 3D flight path. Its receiver searches for other FLARM devices within range and processes the information received. Data on potential conflicts with up to 50 other participating aircraft are stored and aural and visual alerting is used to warn the pilot. The FLARM Unit will provide an alert in respect of the greatest current danger by means of a 'buzzer' or 'beep') and illumination of a Light Emitting Diode (LED) indicator. The display will show the threat level and the lateral and vertical bearing of this threat. If a suitable database is installed, FLARM can also warn of the presence of static aerial obstacles such as masts and cables. Unlike ADS-B, FLARM has a low power consumption and is relatively inexpensive to buy and to install. The range of transmitted and detected signals varies from 3-5 kilometres for the original FLARM equipment to over 10 kilometres for the latest versions. If the detection of proximity to other similarly-equipped and slow moving which are manoeuvring is the main requirement, FLARM is an attractive solution. Gliders and in some cases small helicopters have become popular FLARM platforms in Europe and also to some extent in the USA and in South Africa and Australia /New Zealand. Since the design of ACAS is predicated on the need for a safety net for fixed wing aircraft on relatively stable tracks, it is of little use in preventing gliders from colliding with each other because they are frequently close to each other without being in danger of collision. In these circumstances, ACAS would generate give many nuisance advisories, whereas FLARM only gives selective alerts to similarly-equipped aircraft posing a collision risk.
