FLARM (an acronym based on 'flight alarm') is the proprietary name for an electronic device which is in use as a means of alerting pilots of small aircraft, particularly gliders, to potential collisions with other aircraft which are similarly equipped. The most recent versions, which are supplied under the proprietary name 'PowerFLARM', have options which, if taken, allow them to also detect aircraft fitted with ADS-B capable transponders and to provide estimated range and altitude difference (only) on other aircraft fitted with mode C/S transponders. The system is also capable of being used to alert pilots to obstacle proximity subject to use of a suitable database. The idea was inspired by the concept of broadcasting position which led to the concept of ADS-B. The 'problem' with FLARM is, however, that it does not transmit any signal detectable by ACAS or ADS-B. This means that small aircraft which rely exclusively on FLARM for collision avoidance will be invisible to aircraft which rely on ACAS as a safety net against mid air collision. The FLARM serial data protocol is public, while the prediction engine of the FLARM radio-protocol is proprietary and licensed to various OEMs. The prediction engine itself is subject to a patent held by Onera (France).
