Range and bearing lines are manual tools and thus the result heavily depends on the controller's proficiency with them. The following list contains some examples where the numbers presented may be misleading: when measuring the distance between the tips of the speed vectors, the snap feature is normally not available. Therefore, imperfect clicking may lead to a false perception of the expected separation. Even a few pixels on the screen may equal a full nautical mile, depending on the range being used.. CopyrightSKYbrary correctly judging where the CPA is requires some experience. CopyrightSKYbrary the aircraft track may not coincide with the direction of the range and bearing line when a turn is expected before the trajectory intersection point.. CopyrightSKYbrary in order to reduce screen clutter with unnecessary information, the time displayed is often calculated to a minute. In almost all cases this means that some rounding is done. Consequently, a time difference of one minute between two aircraft flying to the same waypoint may mean anything between 4 and 10 miles for a common 420-450 kt groundspeed scenario (these groundspeeds correspond to 7-7.5 NM per minute, i.e. a difference of 3.6-3.8 NM (a little more than half a minute) will be rounded up to 1 minute and a difference of 10 NM (a little less than 90 seconds) will also be rounded to 1 minute). It is therefore advisable to either cross-check this reading with another method/tool (e.g. TCT, manual speed/distance calculation, etc.) or to assume the worst-case scenario.. CopyrightSKYbrary
