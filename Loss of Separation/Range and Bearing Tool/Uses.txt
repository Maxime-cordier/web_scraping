The range and bearing tool has a variety of practical applications, including: Measuring distances between points on the screen (e.g. waypoints, navaids, obstacles, towns, specific points of SUAs, airways, trajectories, etc.).. CopyrightSKYbrary Measuring the distance between an aircraft and a point, e.g. to calculate an estimate. CopyrightSKYbrary Measuring the distances between two aircraft and the point where their trajectories intersect. This information may then be used for conflict detection. CopyrightSKYbrary Measuring the distance between the ends of two aircraft speed vectors, e.g. at the CPA to determine whether horizontal separation will be ensured. CopyrightSKYbrary
