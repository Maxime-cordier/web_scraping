ICAO require the establishment of AIRPROX reporting and investigation procedures and these are specified in national procedures. Typically, national authorities establish a special committee to investigate AIRPROX reports which allocates the actual risk classification and to recommend further action. Some States use their Annex 13 Accident Investigation Agency to also investigate all AIRPROX, not just those which are considered to be a Serious Incident. Very few states freely publish their AIRPROX investigations - Switzerland and the UK are notable exceptions. An AIRPROX should be reported as soon as possible to facilitate investigation of the incident. If circumstances allow, the pilot should report the incident immediately to ATC using RTF, the details will then be reported by ATC to the appropriate body. If it is not possible to report an AIRPROX in flight (e.g. because the frequency in use is too busy) the pilot should report the incident as soon as possible after landing. ATS units to whom AIRPROX incidents are reported should also report the circumstances of which they are aware to the appropriate body. In all cases, initial verbal reports should be followed up by full written reports using any prescribed form which may be in use for that purpose. Depending on circumstances, an AIRPROX may qualify as a Serious Incident which will then require that it be reported to and investigated by the National Accident Investigation Agency under the terms of ICAO Annex 13, Chapters 4 and 5. Non-Annex 13 AIRPROX investigations are usually a special case of State Mandatory Occurrence Reporting and most are followed up by or in association with the applicable Regulatory Authority under the terms of ICAO Annex 13 Chapter 8, in contrast to one which is deemed to have also been a Serious Incident to whereas an Investigation carried out in accordance with the principles of ICAO Annex 13 must be independent of any Regulatory or other influence.
