An AIRPROX is a situation in which, in the opinion of a pilot or air traffic services personnel, the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and speed have been such that the safety of the aircraft involved may have been compromised. (ICAO Doc 4444: PANS-ATM). ICAO defines a series of classifications for AIRPROX events which have been reported and subsequently investigated by an appropriate body. It is required that this classification should be assigned on the basis only of actual risk, not potential risk. This means that only the residual risk after any avoiding action is considered. The available classification categories are: The definition and classification of an AIRPROX given above was agreed prior to the introduction of ground radar and airborne systems (ACAS) capable of measuring accurately the actual separation of the aircraft involved. An AIRPROX may occur as a result of a Level Bust or Airspace Infringement. Safety nets such as ACAS and STCA mitigate the resultant risk of collision. An AIRPROX is commonly referred to as a Near Midair Collision (NMAC) in the USA; however, they are not precisely the same as a comparison of their definitions demonstrates. Whereas an NMAC is always an AIRPROX, an AIRPROX is not necessarily an NMAC.
