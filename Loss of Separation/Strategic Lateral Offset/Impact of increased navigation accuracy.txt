The increasing accuracy of en route navigation on designated ATS routes has had the effect of increasing the probability of loss of separation: Route or track centrelines are now routinely flown over long distances to within a few tens of metres of lateral and vertical accuracy, and often much better than that, and therefore a clearance error from any source has a reduced margin for occurrence entirely attributable to that accuracy. This includes unplanned changes of level due to clear air turbulence and intentional variation in route to avoid the worst effects of wake vortex turbulence. The Mid-Air Collision which occurred in 2006 over Amazonia, Brazil between a BOEING 737-800 and an opposite direction EMB135 Legacy Business Jet occurred in the end because both were flying precisely on the centreline of the ATS route involved.
