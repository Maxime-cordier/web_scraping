The increasing accuracy of en route navigation on designated ATS routes has had the effect of increasing the probability of loss of separation: Between traffic which is not operating in accordance with the correct air traffic control clearance, or. Where an error has been made in the issue of an air traffic control clearance, or. In case of loss of vertical separation between aircraft on the same route, in particular where movements take place outside areas covered by ATC surveillance service. Such areas may be encountered during transit over oceans or remote continental areas.. Route or track centrelines are now routinely flown over long distances to within a few tens of metres of lateral and vertical accuracy, and often much better than that, and therefore a clearance error from any source has a reduced margin for occurrence entirely attributable to that accuracy. This includes unplanned changes of level due to clear air turbulence and intentional variation in route to avoid the worst effects of wake vortex turbulence. The Mid-Air Collision which occurred in 2006 over Amazonia, Brazil between a BOEING 737-800 and an opposite direction EMB135 Legacy Business Jet occurred in the end because both were flying precisely on the centreline of the ATS route involved.
