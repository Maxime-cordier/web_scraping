EUROCONTROL in 2003 launched the Feasibility of ACAS RA Downlink Study (FARADS) Project. The aim of this project was to investigate the technical feasibility and the operational benefits of providing the RA information to the controller in a comprehensive way. The FARADS project was not the first initiative investigating the possibility of displaying RA information at the Controller Working Position (CWP). Studies on the feasibility and operational benefits of RA downlink have been conducted in the USA, in France, and in Japan. In 2005 and 2006, a number of RA downlink real-time simulations were conducted (RADE-2 simulations). The simulations provided evidence that RA downlink can increase controllers’ situation awareness and limit the likelihood of controller’s issuing a clearance to the aircraft responding to the RA. In contrast, no negative effects of RA downlink on the controller’s performance were found (e.g. over-focusing on the RA event). The FARADS Study, completed in 2007, concluded that RA downlink is technically feasible and may deliver safety benefits. However, these benefits could not be quantified due to insufficient data. Since the completion of FARADS, EUROCONTROL and other organisations have undertaken monitoring work to provide that data and examine the interactions between ground based and airborne safety nets (STCA vs. ACAS). That has been done in the scope of EUROCONTROL Pass Project (completed in 2009) and further investigated by SESAR.
