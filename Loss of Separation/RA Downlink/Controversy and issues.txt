While displaying ACAS RAs to the controller would generally enhance their situational awareness, there also are a few issues causing concern: In accordance with ICAO SARPs, a controller is expected to continue to issue clearances and instructions to separate aircraft until the pilot reports an RA. Therefore, if ACAS RAs are to be presented on the controller working position, a clear and unambiguous description of the controllers' obligations is necessary.. Not all ACAS RAs must be reported (only those that require a deviation from the current ATC clearance). Therefore, many RAs will be displayed to controllers which otherwise would not need to be reported by the pilot. The pilot is not aware when an ACAS RA is downlinked.. It is possible (while unlikely) that the pilot may have no RA displayed in the cockpit and yet the controller is seeing an RA.. The information presented to the controller might be outdated at the moment it appears on the situational display (due to surveillance latency) which would make it outdated and therefore potentially unsafe. Even if the controller is only using the RA "for information" regarding the direction of the level change, this information may be not up to date (due to e.g. an RA reversal) at the time it is presented to the controller. Even a delay of a few seconds could be significant. However, the same limitation applies to any surveillance information presented on controller's screen..
