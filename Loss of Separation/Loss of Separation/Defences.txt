Pilot situational awareness of the location and intent of other aircraft gained from listening to radio traffic, visual identification and monitoring and ACAS, especially when not in receipt of an ATS radar or procedural control or when operating outside controlled airspace;. Standard Operating Procedures, both on the flight deck and in the Air Traffic Services Unit (ATSU), which detail procedures to be followed to reduce the risk of loss of separation;. Aircraft onboard equipment which warns of potential collision with other aircraft (ACAS) and allows an appropriate procedural response to risk. However, note that not all aircraft are required to be fitted with ACAS - only civil turbine-powered aircraft having a maximum certified takeoff mass in excess of 5,700 kg, or a maximum approved passenger seating configuration of more than 19.(ICAO Annex 6 Part I Chapter 6 Para 6.18 and EASA IR-OPS CAT.IDE.A.155, EU-OPS 1.668);. Ground-based equipment designed to warn of potential collision with other aircraft (STCA).. Ground-based equipment designed to verify that the current clearances provide adequate separation in the short term (Tactical Controller Tool (TCT)).. Ground-based equipment designed to warn of potential conflict between aircraft in flight (MTCD).. Use of high quality communication systems and Transponder (Mode C and Mode S);. Improve standard of pilot and ATCO training, especially in: Air-ground communications safety; Loss of separation awareness; Crew resource management;. Air-ground communications safety;. Loss of separation awareness;. Crew resource management;. Provide more and improved ATC safety nets, e.g. Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA). Safety Nets must be set up so as to generate low levels of Nuisance alerts whilst providing useful warning time.. Safety Nets must be set up so as to generate low levels of Nuisance alerts whilst providing useful warning time.. Use of structured scan by air traffic controllers..
