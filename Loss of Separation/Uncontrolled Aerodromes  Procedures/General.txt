There is no substitute for situational awareness while in the vicinity of an uncontrolled aerodrome. It is essential that pilots be aware of, and look out for, other traffic, and exchange traffic information when approaching or departing from an uncontrolled aerodrome. Use of the appropriate radio frequency and communications protocols is critical to the safety of both IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) and VFR (Visual Flight Rules) traffic at an uncontrolled aerodrome.
