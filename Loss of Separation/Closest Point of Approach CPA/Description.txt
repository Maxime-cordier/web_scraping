The adherence to separation standards is an essential part of aviation safety. In a surveillance environment, this is usually expressed in a minimum distance that is allowed between aircraft if no (or not sufficient) vertical spacing is provided. Since the distance at the CPA is crucial in deciding whether or not a safety occurrence has happened it is important that it can be determined (a) accurately and (b) well in advance, so that corrective action is taken if needed. The most popular means to obtain the CPA are: Extending the speed vectors and trying to determine the CPA. It is obviously somewhere at the end of the fourth minute but the precise moment is difficult to pinpoint.
