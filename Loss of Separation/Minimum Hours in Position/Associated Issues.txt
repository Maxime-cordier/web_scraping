All the cases described in the previous section are generally beneficial to the ATM system. Combining the expertise and experience from different (but relevant) fields can synergise and produce excellent results. For example, an ATM expert designing procedures or airspace features may experience them first-hand as an end-user as well. An instructor in theoretical training can enrich the training by adding current situational examples or identify gaps in the training process. On the other hand, special care must be taken to balance the two worlds so that safety is not compromised. The primary risks are: Not being there. If a person is currently acting as a controller but his primary occupation is something else it is possible that their mind remains focused on tasks other than the provision of ATS, especially in situations that seem like low or medium workload. Such circumstances are conductive to complacency and human error and may eventually contribute to an incident.. Erosion of practical skills. Sector and unit capacity definitions are based on the assumption that controllers are able to execute routine tasks in an expeditious manner. Therefore, a person that only seldom works in the ops room (or in the tower) may find it more demanding to perform e.g. simple interactions with the ATM system. This may, depending on the circumstances, result in the person being overloaded with traffic that could have been safely handled by a regular controller that only works at that position.. Not being up to date. The ATM environment is constantly evolving. While it may sometimes appear that this happens at a slow pace, the truth is that small changes, such as an updated letter of agreement, new sectorisation or a new/updated procedure appear quite frequently..
