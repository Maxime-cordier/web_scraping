All the cases described in the previous section are generally beneficial to the ATM system. Combining the expertise and experience from different (but relevant) fields can synergise and produce excellent results. For example, an ATM expert designing procedures or airspace features may experience them first-hand as an end-user as well. An instructor in theoretical training can enrich the training by adding current situational examples or identify gaps in the training process. On the other hand, special care must be taken to balance the two worlds so that safety is not compromised. The primary risks are:
