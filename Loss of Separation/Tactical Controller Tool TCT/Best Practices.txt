The advice given in this section is derived from experience and common sense. It provides general recommendations regarding the use of TCT and is not expected to supersede or replace local instructions. Lock headings – when aircraft are about to pass at near-minimum separation, an instruction to continue on the present heading is likely to prevent an undesired deviation at an improper time.. Traffic Information – as an alternative to heading “locking”, traffic information may be given to the flight crews to enhance their situational awareness.. Avoid over-reliance – just like any other software tool, the TCT has some limitations or may fail at times. For example, surveillance-based TCT are not reliable for climbing/descending aircraft whose ground speed may change by more than 100 kt depending on the circumstances.. Take into account the reduced margin of error – while “softer” interventions and “tighter” separations provide efficiency, they also offer limited room for error (e.g. due to deviation or non-compliance with the clearance)..
