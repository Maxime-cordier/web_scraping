When parallel runway centrelines are separated by more than 9000'/2745 m (9200' if airport elevation is above 5000' MSL), no specific restrictions are imposed on simultaneous approach procedures once the aircraft is established on the final approach course. However, when centrelines are spaced by 9000' or less, special procedures must be put in force to help preclude Loss of Separation between aircraft conducting simultaneous approaches. ATC procedures permit ILS/RNAV/GLS instrument approach operations to dual or triple parallel runway configurations. ILS/RNAV/GLS approaches to parallel runways are categorised as either Dependent approaches or Independent approaches. Simultaneous approaches to parallel runways with centerline spacing of 9000' or less fall into one of the following three classes: RNAV approach procedures that are approved for simultaneous operations require GPS as the sensor for position updating. VOR/DME, DME/DME and IRU RNAV updating is not authorized.
