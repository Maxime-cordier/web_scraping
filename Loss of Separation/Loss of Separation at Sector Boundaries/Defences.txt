Controllers should be pro-active and: Search for and obtain information about uncorrelated aircraft approaching the sector and verify without undue delay intentions ;. Verify entry flight levels in case of doubt;. Ensure increased separation in “suspicious” situations (e.g. if an aircraft appears to climb higher than the previously coordinated level). See the picture below;. Avoid the combination of clearance and frequency change in one transmission;. Watch out for call sign confusion;. Controllers should initiate timely and pro-active coordination as applicable: Make sure all potentially conflicting aircraft are on the same frequency;. If necessary, request earlier transfer on frequency, release for climb/descent etc.;. If appropriate, ask the upstream sector controller to issue an ATC clearance to the aircraft (vector, direct routes, climb/descent);. Coordinate as soon as possible with the adjacent sector’s controller avoiding actions given to own traffic which may take it close to or into the adjacent sector’s airspace;. Coordinate with the other sector/unit when it is known or suspected that different separation minima are in use..
