An operator shall not operate an aeroplane in defined portions of airspace where, based on regional air navigation agreement, a vertical separation minimum 300 m (1000ft) applies unless approved to do so by the Authority (RVSM Approval). EASA IR-OPS SPA.RVSM.100 and SPA.RVSM.110, EU-OPS 1.241 See also EU-OPS 1.872.. Prior to granting the RVSM approval... the State shall be satisfied that:. a) the vertical navigation performance capability of the aeroplane satisfies the (laid down requirements); b) the operator has instituted appropriate procedures in respect of continued airworthiness (maintenance and repair) practices and programmes; and c) the operator has instituted appropriate flight crew procedures for operation in RVSM airspace. Note: An RVSM approval is valid globally on the understanding that any operating procedures specific to a given region will be stated in the Operations Manual or appropriate crew guidance. (ICAO Annex 6 Part I Chapter 7, Para 7.2.5.) An operator shall ensure that aeroplanes operated in RVSM airspace are equipped with: Two independent altitude measurement systems; An altitude alerting system; An automatic altitude control system; and A secondary surveillance radar (SSR) transponder with altitude reporting system that can be connected to the altitude measurement system in use for altitude keeping. (IR-OPS SPA.RVSM.110, EU-OPS 1.872). Two independent altitude measurement systems;. An altitude alerting system;. An automatic altitude control system; and. A secondary surveillance radar (SSR) transponder with altitude reporting system that can be connected to the altitude measurement system in use for altitude keeping.
