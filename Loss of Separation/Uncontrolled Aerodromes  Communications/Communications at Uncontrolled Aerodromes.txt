There are different levels of service provision for air to ground radio communications at uncontrolled aerodromes. These range from no service to provision of an Air/Ground radio service to an Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS) or Flight Service Station (FSS) with the nomenclature varying by country. The procedures associated with the various levels of service are as follows: The normal callsign is “Radio” after the station name. When operating in the A/G environment, the basic principle is that aircraft announce their position and separate themselves from other aircraft in accordance with the Rules of the Air and any published aerodrome procedures. Only carry out a manoeuvre (such as taxiing, take-off or landing) if you are satisfied if it is safe to do so and will not conflict with other traffic.
