Communications procedures vary from country to country and also can vary in accordance with the level of service provisions at the aerodrome in question. The following lists provide reporting protocols for most situations. The following procedures apply when flights are conducted under Visual Flight Rules (VFR). NOTE: In the interest of minimizing possible conflict with local traffic and minimizing radio congestion on the MF or ATF, pilots of en-route VFR aircraft should avoid passing through MF or ATF areas whenever practical The following applies to an aircraft operating under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) in both Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) and in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The pilot-in-command of an IFR aircraft who intends to depart from an uncontrolled aerodrome shall: The pilot-in-command of an IFR aircraft who intends to conduct an approach to or a landing at an uncontrolled aerodrome shall report on the appropriate frequency: They will also report the aircraftâ€™s position: In addition to these requirements, pilots operating aircraft under IFR into an uncontrolled aerodrome, when the weather conditions at the aerodrome could permit VFR circuit operations, are expected to approach and land on the active runway that may be established by the aircraft operating in the VFR circuit unless that runway is not suitable for the IFR aircraft. Pilots operating aircraft under IFR at an uncontrolled aerodrome do not establish any priority over aircraft operating under VFR at that aerodrome. Should it be necessary for the IFR aircraft to approach and/or land on a runway contrary to the established VFR operation, it is expected that appropriate communications, between pilots or between pilots and the air-ground facility, will be effected in order to ensure there is no traffic conflict.
