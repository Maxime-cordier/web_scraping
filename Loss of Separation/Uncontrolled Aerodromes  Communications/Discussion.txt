There is no substitute for alertness and situational awareness while in the vicinity of an uncontrolled aerodrome. It is essential that pilots look out for, and be aware of, other traffic and exchange relevant information when approaching or departing an uncontrolled aerodrome. To achieve the greatest degree of safety, it is essential that all radio-equipped aircraft monitor and transmit on a common designated frequency and follow the appropriate reporting protocols. Designated frequencies can include a Mandatory Frequency (MF) or an Aerodrome Traffic Frequency (ATF) which will be published in the Flight Supplement or on an approach chart for the airport in question. In the absence of a specified MF or ATF frequency, the country specific frequency for use at uncontrolled airports should be used. In the UK, this is referred to as "SafetyCom" callsign "traffic" is currently assigned the use of VHF frequency 135.475 MHz. In Canada, the published Universal Communications (UNICOM) frequency should be used in the absence of a published MF or ATF frequency or, if there is no UNICOM, 123.2 MHz.
