Speed control is used to facilitate a safe and orderly flow of traffic. This is achieved by instructions to adjust speed in a specified manner. Speed adjustments should be limited to those necessary to establish and/or maintain a desired separation minimum or spacing. Instructions involving frequent changes of speed, including alternate speed increases and decreases, should be avoided. Aircraft should be advised when a speed control restriction is no longer required. The flight crew should inform ATC if unable to comply with a speed instruction. The future position of an aircraft (and, consequently, separation) is determined by the ground speed. Since it is impractical to use it directly, the indicated airspeed (IAS) and Mach number are used instead to achieve the desired ground speed. At levels at or above FL 250, speed adjustments should be expressed in multiples of 0.01 Mach. At levels below FL 250, speed adjustments should be expressed in multiples of 10 kt based on IAS. It is the controller's task to calculate the necessary IAS or Mach number that would result in the appropriate ground speed. The following factors need to be taken into account: Aircraft type (range of appropriate speeds). Wind speed and direction (in case the two aircraft are not on the same flight path). Phase of flight (climb, cruise, descent). Aircraft level (especially if the two aircraft are at different levels). Restrictions on the use of speed control: Speed control is not to be applied to aircraft in a holding pattern.. Only minor speed adjustments not exceeding 20 kt IAS should be used for aircraft on intermediate and final approach.. Speed control should not be applied to aircraft after passing 4 NM from the threshold on final approach..
