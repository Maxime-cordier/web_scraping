Separation adjustment (e.g. two successive aircraft are separated by 9 NM and the required separation over the FIR exit point is 10 NM). Separation preservation (e.g. two successive aircraft have the necessary separation but this may change if one of them or both change their speed). Delay absorption (an alternative to flying a holding pattern). Avoid or reduce vectoring: in some situations speed control may be used instead of vectoring in some situations speed control may be used in combination with a vectoring instruction, in order to reduce the time an aircraft flies on heading and/or the heading change.. in some situations speed control may be used instead of vectoring. in some situations speed control may be used in combination with a vectoring instruction, in order to reduce the time an aircraft flies on heading and/or the heading change..
