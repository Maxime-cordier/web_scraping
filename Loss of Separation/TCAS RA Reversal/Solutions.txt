Technologically, the improved reversal logic of TCAS Version 7.1 already has been a major step forward. This upgraded software monitors RA compliance in coordinated encounters (i.e., as noted, when both aircraft are TCAS II equipped). When the system detects that an aircraft is not responding correctly to an RA, TCAS II issues a reversal RA to the aircraft pilot, requiring manoeuvres in accordance with the RA. EUROCONTROL guidance explains: “In single-equipage encounters (i.e., when only one aircraft is TCAS II equipped), Version 7.1 will recognise the situation and will issue a reversal if the unequipped threat aircraft moves in the same vertical direction as the TCAS II–equipped aircraft. Although the reversal logic change is transparent to flight crews, it will, nevertheless, bring significant safety improvements.” Procedurally, TCAS RA reversals have long been an element of international technical standards and practices. These include ICAO standards and recommended practices (SARPs) and European Commission Implementing RuIes–Operations (IR-OPS) and European Commission EU OPS 1, which requires that, “An operator shall establish procedures to ensure that: ... When undue proximity to another aeroplane (RA) is detected by [ACAS/TCAS II], the commander or the pilot to whom conduct of the flight has been delegated must ensure that any corrective action indicated by the RA is initiated immediately, unless doing so would jeopardize the safety of the aeroplane; The corrective action must: Never be in a sense opposite to that indicated by the RA; and,. Be in the correct sense [e.g., climb or descend] indicated by the RA, even if this is in conflict with the vertical element of an ATC instruction.”.
