Each ATS unit (or sector if the unit is split) operates on a separate frequency. Therefore, when an aircraft approaches the boundary, the pilot needs to change the operating frequency to that of the next unit or sector. This process is called transfer of communication and is effected either by The transfer of communication is done in accordance with the procedures established in Letters of Agreement or in local procedures (e.g. operations manuals). Within controlled airspace it usually happens a few minutes before the Transfer of Control is effected. This creates a potenially dangerous situation where one controller is responsible for the safety of the flight (but is unable to issue instruction) and another is in contact with the crew (but the aircraft is not yet within the area of responsibility). It is therefore important that the accepting controller does not introduce flight profile changes before the aircraft passes the transfer of control point unless these are coordinated with the transferring controller or a release has been obtained. This does not mean that no communication is to be carried out. There are a number of things that can be safely communicated, e.g.: Another risk with communication transfer is that for a (usually short) period of time no controller is in contact with the flight crew. It is therefore crucial that aircraft being transferred are clear of any potential conflict. While this is applicable to air traffic control in general, the transfer of communication phase is an inherently riskier situation and therefore extra vigilance should be exercised. Also, the risk of Loss of Communication should be taken into account. The accepting unit (or sector) is normally not supposed to inform the transferring unit (or sector) that communication with the aircraft has been established. However, if communication has not been established as expected, the accepting unit (or sector) should notify the transferring unit (or sector). While not mandatory, it is generally safer not to combine communication transfer with other instructions, e.g. level changes. The controller may not be able to correct an errorneous instruction (or a wrong readback) if the pilot changes the frequency quickly enough. If this happens, the situation may quickly deteriorate while neither controller is in contact with the aircraft and both are therefore unable to issue corrective instructions. The situation can be further compounded if there is an issue with the frequency change (e.g. wrong frequency being set) or if the next frequency is congested. Transfer of communication of several aircraft one right after the other may cause frequency blocking (due to simultaneous transmissions) in the downstream sector (or unit). This risk can be mitigated (but not elliminated since most sectors and units have more than one neighbour) by: In case the flight time within a sector (or unit) is very short (e.g. 1-3 minutes) communication may be transferred directly between the two adjacent sectors (or units). This procedure is sometimes called "skipping". The following aspects need to be considered if it is to be used: Special attention
