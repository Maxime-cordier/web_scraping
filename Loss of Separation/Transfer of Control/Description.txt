The transfer of control (TOC) is effected at the transfer of control point. This is usually the point where the flight trajectory crosses the boundary between two adjacent areas of responsibility. This may be a published or a non-published point. An example of the latter is the transfer of control between vertically split sectors where the TOC point position may depend on the vertical speed of the aircraft. TOC is not to be confused with Transfer of Communication. An important ATM principle is that a controlled flight must be under the control of only one ATC unit at any given time. The objective is to establish a clear criterion for the responsibility for flight safety. It is possible, however, that a flight is in contact with one ATC unit whilst being in another units area of responsibility. This may happen for a number of reasons, e.g.: In all the situations above the flight is in contact with one ATC unit while being in the area of responsibility of another controller. This is a potentially dangerous situation because the controller that communicates with the aircraft may not be fully aware of the traffic situation but has the means to issue instructions to the pilot. Therefore, local procedures usually state that the receiving controller may only do this after an appropriate coordination has been effected (e.g. a Release Procedure). The flight crew does not actively participate in the TOC. Consequently there is no controller-pilot message exchange, unlike the transfer of communication procedure. The TOC and the associated procedures are described in Letters of Agreement.
