When properly used, vertical speed control helps to achieve continuous climb/descend (fewer level offs), therefore better efficiency. descents starting close to the top-of-descent. timely accommodation of climb (mostly) and (sometimes) descend requests. reduced workload due to reduced need for vectoring. A proper vertical speed ensures that horizontal separation will be preserved at least until vertical separation is achieved..
