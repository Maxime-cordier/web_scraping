The vertical speed clearance may be a part of a vertical clearance or a separate one. It specifies the required rate of climb/descent, usually in feet per minute and may also contain: upper or lower limit of the vertical speed, if applicable. The phrases "or greater" and "or less" are used in this case. If no limit is specified, then the aircraft is expected to maintain an exact vertical speed.. a condition, if applicable (e.g. until passing a level or a point). further information (e.g. reason for the restriction, e.g. traffic, special use area, etc.). Note: Vertical speed instructions may also be given in meters per second. 1000 ft equals 5 meters per second. Examples: PRE078 climb FL 370 at 1000 feet per minute or greater until passing FL 360 due crossing traffic. EKR365 descend FL 120 at 1500 feet per minute or less. SNA031 descent at 2500 feet per minute or greater due traffic. SLV015 climb at 1500 feet per minute or greater until passing FL 220 due danger area ahead.
