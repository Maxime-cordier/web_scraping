The requirement that air traffic controllers accommodate, in the same airspace volume, a mix of civil and State military flights, often performed in formations, has significant operational consequences. In RVSM airspace there is a requirement to selectively apply two distinct vertical separation minima, 1000 ft and 2000 ft respectively. This requirement necessitates that air traffic controllers have full awareness of the status of aircraft operating in the same airspace volume or in close proximity. The selective application of a set of separation minima increases controllerâ€™s workload considerably.
