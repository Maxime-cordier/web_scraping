ICAO Doc. 7030/4 clearly stipulates: “Except for State aircraft, Operators intending to conduct flights within the volume of airspace specified where RVSM is applied shall require RVSM Approval either from the State in which the Operator is based or from the State in which the aircraft is registered”. However, in order to reduce the workload impact on controllers of handling non-RVSM approved State aircraft, national/military authorities are strongly encouraged to make their transport/tanker fleets compliant with RVSM MASPS[1]. This recommendation relates in particular to those State aircraft which operate on a regular basis as General Air Traffic (GAT) in the RVSM airspace. The amendment to the ATM chapter of the NATO ATM Committee Handbook contains: "National and military authorities are encouraged to make their transport State aircraft fleet compliant with MASPS. However, this retrofit action is technically complex, needs time, and has significant financial consequences”. Currently, the majority of State aircraft are non-RVSM compliant.
