Loss of separation between aircraft sometimes occurs as a result of an aircraft deviating from the cleared track or level without clearance. This may happen for a variety of reasons, captured in the following scenarios: Due to pilot inattention, equipment malfunction or the mis-setting of aircraft equipment. An example of this is flying with the transponder switched off or in standby mode.. Action to avoid a visually-perceived loss of separation from another aircraft.. Action to avoid severe weather if IFR or to remain in VMC if VFR.. Pilot failure to follow ATC clearance or delaying their actioning of an accepted clearance.. Instruction not received or not understood by pilot due to ineffective air-ground communications.. Pilot taking a clearance intended for another aircraft due to callsign confusion.. Pilot receiving a TCAS RA but fails to follow it correctly.. Pilot entering notified airspace without clearance..
