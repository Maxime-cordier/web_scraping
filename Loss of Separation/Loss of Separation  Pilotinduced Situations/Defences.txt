A number of activities are performed so that the risk of loss of separation due to pilot actions is reduced or the consequences of such loss are mitigated so that collision is avoided. The most notable of them are: Standard Operating Procedures, on the flight-deck, which detail procedures to be followed to reduce the chance of loss of separation.. Onboard aircraft equipment designed to warn of potential collision with other aircraft (TCAS).. Pilot training, especially in: Air-ground communications safety; Loss of situation awareness; Use of TCAS.. Air-ground communications safety;. Loss of situation awareness;. Use of TCAS.. Development and improvement of safety nets, e.g. STCA.. Air traffic controller training emphasizing the importance of: Air-ground communication. Appropriate communication reduces the risk of misunderstanding and, consequently, unexpected traffic behaviour. Monitoring pilot compliance with the issued clearances. This allows early detection of aircraft deviation which may help prevent a loss of separation. Appropriate planning, especially in emergency/abnormal situations and weather avoidance scenarios..
