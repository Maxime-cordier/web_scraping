the crossing point are needed to achieve 5 NM at the CPA.. As a result, 5.6 NM at the crossing point are needed to achieve 5 NM at the CPA.. A crossing angle of 120 degrees means that separation will be reduced by 50% between the crossing point and the CPA. As a result, 10 NM at the crossing point are needed to achieve 5 NM at the CPA.. As a result, 10 NM at the crossing point are needed to achieve 5 NM at the CPA.. A crossing angle of 150 degrees means that separation will be reduced by 75% between the crossing point and the CPA. As a result, 20 NM at the crossing point are needed to achieve 5 NM at the CPA.. As a result, 20 NM at the crossing point are needed to achieve 5 NM at the CPA..
