Generally, ATC defensive controlling prior to go-arounds and subsequent ATC prevention of conﬂicts were the barriers with the highest spread of applicability. ATC ad-hoc conﬂict resolution and independent pilot conﬂict resolution are the barriers with the highest spread of applicability to mitigate a conflict. Nevertheless, each airport and ATC unit have different risk levels of exposure to the six scenario outcomes leading to a conﬂict on or after low-level go-around. Therefore, a method of weighting the potential eﬀectiveness of each barrier could be considered which takes account of the prevalent types of runway configuration and traffic mix at individual aerodromes. For instance, an airport with a single runway does not need to consider conflicts involving parallel or crossing runways. Airports with a broad traffic mix of IFR/VFR traffic may wish to consider the risk level of conflict with other aircraft in the vicinity of the airport to be high. Airports with a complex multi-runway operation may wish to consider the risk level involving more than one runway to be of significance. ATC units could carry out their own study of the severity/repeatability of conﬂicts on/after low level go-arounds and use an appropriate method to identify what might be the most eﬀective barriers applicable in their operational environment. The analysis may include assigning different weighing values to the different scenarios depending on the local circumstances.
