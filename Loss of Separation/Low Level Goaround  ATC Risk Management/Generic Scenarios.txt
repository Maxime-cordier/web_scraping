There are no defned separation minima infringement measurements in the aerodrome control environment. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use the term "erosion of safety margins" rather than "loss of separation" in such cases. A go-around event in which all parties (i.e. pilots and controllers) act within the bounds of normal operating procedures is not considered a conflict. A dedicated study carried out by the EUROCONTROL Safety Improvement Sub-Group (SISG) defined a set of six generic scenarios of unsafe low level go-around and tested them against applicable safety barriers (discussed in next section): Conﬂict with departing aircraft from the same runway. Conﬂict with other traffic on the same runway. Conﬂict with departing aircraft from another parallel runway. Conﬂict with departing aircraft from another crossing runway. Conﬂict with other aircraft in the vicinity of the aerodrome, such as crossing or arriving traffic. Conﬂict with other go-around traffic. Not all low level go-arounds lead to conflicts and turn into serious incidents. However, an analysis of reported CTR and TMA safety occurrences has shown that a disproportionally high number of events solved by providence (i.e. good luck) developed as a consequence of missed approaches initiated below 400 ft.
