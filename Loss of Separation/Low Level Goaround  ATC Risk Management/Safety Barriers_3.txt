air traffic monitors and also by early knowledge of the go-around. Examples of situation where controllers prevent a conflict: Advanced coordination between ATCOs in control of other runways and/or approach control. Tactical prevention of post-go-around conﬂicts by individual ATCOs.. Advanced coordination between ATCOs in control of other runways and/or approach control.. Tactical prevention of post-go-around conﬂicts by individual ATCOs.. Pilot prevention of conﬂict. An example of this is the pilot's awareness of potential conflicts and taking independent action in such a manner as to prevent safety margins being eroded. Conflict prevention by pilot is generally limited to VMC ﬂight conditions in order to allow for visual contact with the potentially conﬂicting traffic to be acquired and maintained.. These barriers, when deployed and employed correctly, are capable of alerting ATC, pilots and drivers to the initial stages of a low-level go-around conﬂict in sufficient time to act in order to prevent a collision. ATC ad-hoc conﬂict resolution. This is an improvised last-minute action, once safety margins have already been eroded, by one or more controllers in order to remove the risk of collision and achieve as big a safety margin as practical. Examples: A single ATCO issues an ad-hoc collision avoidance instruction. After coordination ATC implements ad-hoc collision avoidance instructions..

ATCO receives an alert that an aircraft is carrying out a go-around which was previously unknown, perhaps because of poor visibility, line of sight, focus elsewhere, e.g. by a Go-Around Detection System (GARDS). The ATCO is thus able to take early action to mitigate the outcome of an immediate conﬂict. ATC actions (both ad-hoc and system supported) may be limited by the ability to maintain visual contact or by the use of air trafc monitors and also by RTF frequency commonality.. ATC best practice. ATC actions and consequent ﬂight profles for each appropriate scenario on each runway are documented, understood and practised among ATCOs. This may provide faster amd more effective conflict resolution. Best practice however can only be identifed for the most common situations and are generally not available for complex situations.. Pilot provides own conﬂict resolution. This barrier is generally limited to VMC ﬂight conditions in order to allow flight crews to acquire and maintain visual contact with the conﬂicting traffic. Examples of pilot actions providing conflict resolution: Pilot ﬂies own tactical trajectory to increase distance horizontally and/or vertically between aircraft. Pilot/s obtain visual acquisition of conﬂicting traffic and take visual avoidance manoeuvres.. Pilot ﬂies own tactical trajectory to increase distance horizontally and/or vertically between aircraft.. Pilot/s obtain visual acquisition of conﬂicting traffic and take visual avoidance manoeuvres.. Pilot follows TCAS conﬂict resolution. An example of this is the correct response to TCAS resolution advisories. This mitigation is limited by functionality inhibiting RAs below 1000 ft AGL and may also be limited by the level of TCAS fitted to conﬂicting traffic in the aerodrome control environment..
