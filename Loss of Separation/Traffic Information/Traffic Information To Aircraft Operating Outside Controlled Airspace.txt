Due to the variety of factors influencing the nature of the flight information services and particularly the provision of information on possible collision hazards to aircraft operating outside controlled airspace, it is not possible to specify standard texts for these types of messages. In provision of AFIS, EUROCONTROL Manual of Aerodrome Flight Information Services specifies that the following information shall be provided as appropriate: a) direction of flight of aircraft concerned b) type and wake turbulence category (if known) of aircraft concerned; c) level of aircraft concerned, including eventual changes; d) relative bearing of the aircraft concerned in terms of the 12-hour clock as well as distance from the conflicting traffic; or 1) actual or estimated position of the aircraft concerned; or 2) estimated times; and e) any other information considered relevant (e.g. approaching, crossing the traffic information area/traffic information zone (TIA/TIZ), estimated take-off or landing time).
