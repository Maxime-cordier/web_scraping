A number of tools have been developed to assist controllers in determining and calculating conflicts, the most popular being: Range and bearing lines. These are simple elastic vectors used to measure distances and bearings between aircraft, or between an aircraft and a point in space. Their use is based on the assumption that a level flight will maintain its speed and therefore the determination of the separation at the crossing point (or at the CPA) is a matter of simple calculation.. Tactical Controller Tool (TCT). This tool is part of some ATC systems and is often used to automate the calculation described above. It is normally activated by the controller to check an aircraft pair for a potential conflict. Additionally, it may include a suggestion for vectoring one (or both) aircraft.. Medium Term Conflict Detection (MTCD). This tool examines the trajectories of aircraft and is activated automatically. If a situation is detected, a special warning (normally in the aircraft label) is presented to the controller.. What-If (Probe). This is a tool that helps the controller evaluate a planned (but not issued) clearance..
