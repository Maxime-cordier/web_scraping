The Cleared Level Adherence Monitoring (CLAM) warning provides indication to the controller when the transponder-derived level information differs from the controller-input cleared level. The alert is activated automatically when the necessary conditions are met. The CLAM warning is one of the features that warn the controller about a level bust. This is important for two reasons: While some ATS systems consider CLAM to be a safety net, others regard it as an advisory (monitoring) tool as the underlying event (level bust) does not necessarily require an immediate response (as is the case with STCA, MSAW and APW). The indication on the situation display] may take various forms, e.g. the "CLAM", "BUST" or another string on top of the aircraft label, specific colour for the cleared and/or actual level, etc. The choice of colour has to be conspicuous, e.g. yellow, orange, magenta, red, etc. so that controller attention is immediately attracted. CopyrightSKYbrary Examples of CLAM representations: the orange string CLAM above the label (left) and pink background of the cleared flight level field in the label (right). The examples are not taken from a real life system and are for illustrative purposes only. The CLAM logic normally includes features that reduce nuisance alarms. For example, a warning is normally not displayed if: Limitations of the CLAM warning:
