Formation OAT flights are a major concern as they are usually performed by fast-moving aircraft at higher levels (compared to general aviation). Upon each initial report on a new radio frequency, the formation leader is to indicate to ATC that the flight is a formation and the number of aircraft it consists of. Similarly to GAT, a formation flight is to be considered as a single aircraft in regard to navigation and position reporting and clearances issued by ATC. Separation within the formation is responsibility of the participants. Additionally, if the operation requires two (or more) formation flights to operate below prescribed IFR separation minima, the leaders are responsible for the safety distance between the formations. Two types of military formations are defined. In a standard formation each element (aircraft) must remain within 1 NM horizontally and 100 ft vertically from the formation leader (as opposed to a GAT formation where the horizontal limit is 0.5 NM). Only the lead aircraft is to use the transponder as directed by ATC. Elements that are outside the horizontal and/or vertical limits are considered a non-standard formation. These flights represent an unusual aerial activity that must be pre-coordinated between the flight leader and the ATC unit concerned in due time prior departure. It is an ATC decision to approve or disapprove a non-standard formation and to determine special conditions for conducting the flight. For non-standard formations, each individual aircraft is to squawk as directed by ATC.
