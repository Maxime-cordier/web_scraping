When surveillance systems are used (based on radar, ADS-B or MLAT) the minimum separation prescribed by ICAO Doc 4444 is 5 nm (unless otherwise stated by the appropriate ATS authority). This minimum may be reduced by the appropriate ATS authority but not below: The separation minimum or minima based on radar and/or ADS-B and/or MLAT systems to be applied are to be prescribed by the appropriate ATS authority based on the equipment used. Therefore, higher than 5 nm horizontal separation minima may be applied in certain parts of the airspace and/or at certain times.
