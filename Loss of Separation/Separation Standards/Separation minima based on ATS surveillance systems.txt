When surveillance systems are used (based on radar, ADS-B or MLAT) the minimum separation prescribed by ICAO Doc 4444 is 5 nm (unless otherwise stated by the appropriate ATS authority). This minimum may be reduced by the appropriate ATS authority but not below: 3 nm when the surveillance systems' capabilities at a given location permit this;. 2.5 nm between succeeding aircraft which are established on the same final approach track within 10 nm of the runway threshold. A number of additional criteria must be met in order to apply this separation minimum (described in detail in ICAO Doc 4444, 8.7.3.2 b)).. The separation minimum or minima based on radar and/or ADS-B and/or MLAT systems to be applied are to be prescribed by the appropriate ATS authority based on the equipment used. Therefore, higher than 5 nm horizontal separation minima may be applied in certain parts of the airspace and/or at certain times.
