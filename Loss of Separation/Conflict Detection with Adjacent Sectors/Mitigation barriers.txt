Mitigation barriers are intended to reduce or eliminate the impact of a problem after it has happened. These are general mitigation barriers against loss of separation and are not specific to the conflict detection with adjacent sectors. Therefore, they will only be listed and not explained in detail: Routine Structured Scan – this barrier has the potential to resolve a situation after e.g. a conflicting clearance has been issued.. Operational TRM – a colleague warning may be a very effective way to spot and resolve a conflict situation.. Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) is a system tool that warns the controller of imminent loss of separation.. ACAS is an airborne equipment to warn or advise the pilots to take appropriate collision avoiding action.. See and Avoid relies on the pilots to detect the conflicting traffic visually and thus to avoid collision.. Providence – good luck..
