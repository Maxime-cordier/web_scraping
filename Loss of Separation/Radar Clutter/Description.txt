The electromagnetic signals processed by the radar receiver (especially for PSR) consist of three main components: If the combined signal (useful+noise+clutter) is shown on the situation display directly, two problems occur: The main objective of radar data processing is to separate the useful signals (i.e. the aircraft) from noise and clutter. While both phenomena have the same effect on the equipment (reduce the probability of finding a real targer and increase the chance of false alarms), they are created differently, and, therefore, are mitigated using different techniques. Internal noise is reduced by using high quality equipment and external noise is mitigated by increasing the transmitter's power. This leads to stronger reflected signals, and therefore, better detection, since external noise is not affected. It should be noted, that power cannot be increased indefinitely. Increasing transmitter power will have no (or even detrimental) effect on clutter suppression, as the undesired signals will also become stronger. Therefore, more spohisticated methods are used to mitigate clutter, e.g.: It should be noted that, depending on the purpose of the equipment, the clutter described above may be considered as useful signal, e.g.:
