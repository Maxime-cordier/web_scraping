There is no internationally agreed definition of a "Very Light Jet” (VLJ) category. Several definitions may be found in specialized publications which do not differ significantly from one another. In general "Very Light Jets” is a term used to describe a group of small jet aircraft with capacity of 4-8 seats and a maximum take-off mass below 3000 kg. In ICAO classification they are considered as "Light aircraft”. In some sources instead of VLJ the terms “micro jet”, “entry-level jet”, “very light personal jet” or “personal jet” can also be met referring to the same category of small jet aircraft. In principle VLJs have different performance characteristics compared to commercial jet aircraft, notably: Optimum cruising levels FL210 – FL390;. Final approach speed of less than 100 knots;. Cruising speed of Mach.55 – Mach.62;. Rates of climb and descent between 2000 ft/min – 4000 ft/min.. In contrast the performances of commercial jet aircraft are the following: Optimum cruising levels FL330 – FL390;. Final approach speed of more than 140 knots;. Cruising speed of Mach.74 – Mach.78 (medium) and Mach.80 – Mach.86 (heavy);. Rates of climb and descent between 2000 – 4000 ft/min..
