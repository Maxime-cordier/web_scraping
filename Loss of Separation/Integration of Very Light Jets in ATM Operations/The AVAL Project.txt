The introduction of VLJ, and other Light Jets (LJ) that are currently not required to be equipped with the ACAS II is raising questions about their integration within the current ATM system. The AVAL (ACAS on VLJs and LJs â€“ Assessment of safety Level) project has assessed the impact of these operations on the safety benefits delivered by ACAS II, and whether it would be appropriate to extend the ACAS II mandate to include these aircraft. The project findings support the conclusion that modifying the criteria for ACAS II equipage in Europe so as to include at least the mainstream VLJs, and preferably all light jets under 5700 kg, is the best option for safe and effective VLJ operations in Europe. The project also concluded that equipping VLJs and other LJs with TCAS I is the less preferred option and no ACAS equipage of these aircraft is better. The project recommended extension of the European ACAS II mandate to include all civil fixed-wing turbine-engined aircraft with a maximum cruising speed of over 250 kt. The final AVAL project report is accessible from "Further Reading" below.
