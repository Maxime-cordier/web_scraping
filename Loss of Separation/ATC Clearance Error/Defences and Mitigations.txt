Common and efficient defences against ATC clearance errors as well as mitigations to reduce their impact are listed below: Two controllers working at the same sector (or unit). Human beings make mistakes often but having an additional person at the same sector not only increases capacity but also allows cross-checking between the two controllers. As a result, most ATC clearance errors are detected and rectified well before the situation escalates. By contrast, in single person operations, this important safety net is not available.. Procedures, e.g. pattern for Flight Progress Strips placement and moving.. Airspace design, e.g. different waypoints used to separate departing and arriving traffic flows.. Software enhancements - e.g. Medium Term Conflict Detection (MTCD), Tactical Controller Tool (TCT), Probe (what-if) for area controllers.. Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System for aerodrome controllers.. Safety Nets act as mitigation measures, applicable both in the air and on the ground.. Structured scan. This technique is an important part of any ATCO training.. Vigilance. Although it is not possible to directly measure or assess it, this remains one of the best defences against errorneous ATC clearances. Procedures to reduce the impact of fatigue, distraction and stress generally provide the foundation of high levels of vigilance..
