At an organizational level, this includes: Standard Operating Procedures in the ATSU, which detail procedures to be followed to reduce the chance of loss of separation.. Implementation of controller support tools, e.g. Tactical Controller Tool (TCT), Probe (What-if), MTCD, etc.. Implementation of ground-based equipment designed to warn of potential collision with other aircraft, e.g. Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA).. Use of two-person teams on one sector (normally designated a planner and an executive controller). Having two controllers handling the same traffic increases the likelihood of error detection.. Improved standard of ATCO training (including refresher training), especially in: Air-ground communications safety; Loss of situation awareness; Use of structured scan; Response to safety net warnings.. Air-ground communications safety;. Loss of situation awareness;. Use of structured scan;. Response to safety net warnings.. In order to reduce the likelihood of making errors that lead to loss of separation, controllers should: Follow the standard procedures (but be ready to deviate from them if the situation requires it).. Perform routine structured scan to detect potential conflicts well in advance and mitigate the "blind spot" effect.. Make use of the support tools available which would allow them to do more in less time, thus freeing up precious seconds.. Resist the urge to accommodate crew requests if unsure about their impact on the overall traffic situation. Naturally, this does not mean that such requests are to be disregarded.. Quickly assess a safety net warning, create a simple plan and only then execute it (without delay). Starting to speak without having decided what to do is likely to make the situation worse.. ACAS/TCAS is an onboard aircraft equipment designed to warn of potential collision with other aircraft. This barrier is meant to mitigate the consequences of a separation loss.
