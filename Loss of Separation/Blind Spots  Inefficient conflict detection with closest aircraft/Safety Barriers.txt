Preventing any of the other contributing factors would not reliably prevent the blind spot occurrences but would only reduce the chance of them to happen. Albeit unreliable, the following may be one of the most efficient risk reduction strategies. Generally, two types of safety barriers exist: The following barriers can help prevent loss of separation caused by Blind Spots: The following mitigation barriers could mitigate the consequences of a loss of separation due to inefficient detection of conflict with the closest aircraft: These barriers are generic (i.e. not specifically designed to mitigate a particular risk). Their presence and effectiveness are independent of the blind spot as a reason for the loss of separation. Therefore, they will not be described in detail in this article.
