ICAO Doc 4444 PANS-ATM Chapter 12 defines the following phraseology to be used in parallel offset operations: ADVISE IF ABLE TO PROCEED PARALLEL OFFSET - used by the controller to determine whether such a manoeuvre is feasible.. PROCEED OFFSET (distance) RIGHT/LEFT OF (route) (track) [CENTRE LINE] [AT (significant point or time)] [UNTIL (significant point or time)] - the instruction format for starting a parallel offset. Example: PRE0405 proceed offset 5 miles left of track until abeam SNA VOR. Example: PRE0405 proceed offset 5 miles left of track until abeam SNA VOR. CANCEL OFFSET (instructions to rejoin cleared flight route or other information) Example: PRE0405 cancel offset, proceed direct to SNA VOR. Example: PRE0405 cancel offset, proceed direct to SNA VOR. REQUEST OFFSET (distance) RIGHT/LEFT OF (route) (track) [CENTRE LINE] [DUE TO WAKE TURBULENCE/TO AVOID WEATHER] - a pilot request to perform a parallel offset. Note that while this is commonly used format it is not a part of the ICAO Standard Phraseology and therefore variations do exist. Example: PRE0405 request 2 miles left of track due to wake turbulence. Example: PRE0405 request 2 miles left of track due to wake turbulence.
