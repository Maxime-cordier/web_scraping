The International Civil Aviation Organizationâ€™s (ICAO) PBN Manual identifies seven navigation specifications under the RNP family: RNP4, RNP2, RNP1, Advanced RNP, RNP APCH, RNP AR APCH and RNP 0.3. RNP 4 is for oceanic and remote continental navigation applications. RNP 2 is for en-route oceanic remote and en-route continental navigation applications. RNP 1 is for arrival and initial, intermediate and missed approach as well as departure navigation applications. Advanced RNP is for navigation in all phases of flight. RNP APCH and RNP AR (authorisation required) APCH are for navigation applications during the approach phase of flight. RNP 0.3 is for the en-route continental, the arrival, the departure and the approach (excluding final approach) phases of flight and is specific to helicopter operations.
