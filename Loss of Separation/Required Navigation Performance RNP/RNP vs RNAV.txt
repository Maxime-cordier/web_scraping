Under the PBN concept, in addition to the RNP navigation specifications there exists the area navigation (RNA) family of navigation specifications. RNAV and RNP navigation specifications are substantially very similar; they only differ in relation to the performance monitoring and alerting requirement which applies to RNP navigation specifications. This means that if the RNP system does not perform the way it should then an alert should be provided to the flight crew. In practical terms what this means is that air traffic control (ATC) can have greater confidence in the track keeping performance of the aircraft and this greater confidence translates into being able to place routes closer together.
