Sectors cannot be split indefinitely â€“ there is no strict rule about this but a sector with less than e.g. 5 minutes of flight time is considered inefficient with present day equipment.. ATM sector management is useful when there are peaks and drops in traffic flow. If the traffic distribution is uniform within the day other options should be used.. Splitting sectors reduces the traffic-related workload (there are less aircraft on the frequency) but also increases inter-sector coordination. This must be taken into account when choosing the sector configuration..
