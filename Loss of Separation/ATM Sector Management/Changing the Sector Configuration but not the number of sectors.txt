Sometimes traffic flows shift in such a way that a different configuration with the same number of sectors is considered preferable than opening a new sector or merging existing sectors. For instance, a configuration of one upper and two lower sectors (which managed a high number of departing and arriving traffic) may need to be replaced by three vertically split sectors (lower, middle and upper) in order to cope with the expected increase of overflying aircraft. As in the other cases, the decision for changing the sector configuration is made by the supervisor based on the traffic demand. The procedures to be followed are described in the ATSU manual of operations and typically include: Risks, associated with changing the sector configuration while preserving the number of sectors:
