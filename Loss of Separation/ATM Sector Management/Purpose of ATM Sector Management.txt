There are several ways to respond to increased traffic demand: Introduction of new equipment that helps the controllers handle more traffic while preserving the attained levels of safety and efficiency (e.g. Mode S, RVSM, OLDI, MTCD, etc.). This option is a part of the strategic development of any ANSP and is used at regular intervals or when a new technology becomes available. Not usable at tactical level (day-to-day and intraday use).. Imposition of flow control measures, i.e. restricting the number of aircraft that can enter the sector airspace. This is the last line of defence against traffic overload and is usually used when other options have been exhausted. Usually causes delays and can even lead to the disruption of normal operations in case of improper and widespread use.. Opening more ATM sectors so that the traffic (and workload) is split over more controllers. This option is used to handle daily traffic fluctuations better, making optimal use of the personnel available.. The purpose of ATM sector management is to ensure that optimal sector configurations are used at all times. A sector configuration is to be considered optimal if no excess sectors are open and no sector is subject to over-delivery for a prolonged period of time.
