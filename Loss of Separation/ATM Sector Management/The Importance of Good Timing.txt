The main benefits of ATM sector management are the optimal use of personnel and the ability to handle traffic peaks safely and efficiently. These tasks can only be achieved with good timing, which means that: New sectors are usually to be open 10 to 20 minutes before the increased traffic demand to allow controllers to safely perform the procedures;. Sectors should be merged only when there is reasonable assurance that the same sectors will not have to be reopened within a reasonable period of time (at least 30-40 minutes). Too frequent openings/closings of sectors should be avoided, as this may lead to: poor coordination with adjacent units; aircraft being transferred to wrong frequencies; overall increase of the controller workload, associated with the procedure.. poor coordination with adjacent units;. aircraft being transferred to wrong frequencies;. overall increase of the controller workload, associated with the procedure..
