The ADS-B standardisation work is now completed for the initial ADS-B applications, namely all “ADS-B out” and ATSAW applications. It has delivered the Safety, Performance and Interoperability Requirements for: ADS-B in Non Radar Airspace (ADS-B NRA). ADS-B in Radar Airspace (ADS-B RAD). ADS-B for Airport Surface Surveillance (ADS-B APT). ATSAW In-Trail Procedure in oceanic airspace (ATSAW ITP). ATSAW Visual Separation in Approach (ATSAW VSA). ATSAW during Flight Operations (ATSAW AIRB). ATSAW on the Airport Surface (ATSAW SURF). In addition, the standardisation of the first spacing application has also been completed with the delivery of the Safety, Performance and Interoperability Requirements for: Flight Deck Interval Management (ASPA-FIM). Furthermore, work on the future ADS-B applications (spacing, separation and self-separation) is ongoing or planned by SESAR (Europe) and NextGen (USA). The standards of future applications will be developed also by EUROCAE/RTCA joint work.
