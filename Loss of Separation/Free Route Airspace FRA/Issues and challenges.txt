As any new technology and procedure in aviation, FRA poses a number of challenges to the users. These do not outweigh the benefits but need to be addressed properly in order to gain the best of FRA. Such issues and challenges are: Conflicts may become harder to detect due to the spread and increased number of possible conflicting points.. Changes to the separation provision methods used by ATC (e.g. direct routes are less an option for solving conflicts since most aircraft are using the most direct route available anyway).. Vectoring aircraft that have planned their route using points with geographical coordinates can lead to issues when instructing the flight crew to resume own navigation.. Conflicts occurring shortly after entering the area of responsibility of an ATC sector require controllers to be even more vigilant during transfer/acceptance of control.. Need for coordinated approach to FRA implementation – the efficiency benefits will only be achieved if FRA is deployed over large areas and appropriated measures are taken so that aerodromes do not become bottlenecks.. Need for enhanced (system supported) coordination between ANSPs in case FRA extends beyond the state borders.. Use of odd/even levels, usually determined in the respective AIPs, may not follow the standard assignment (i.e. odd=eastbound, even=westbound).. Aircraft flying along the sector boundaries – the probability of loss of separation in case of deviation from the planned route (e.g. due to weather) shall be given due consideration.. Aircraft flying near special use areas (danger areas, TRAs, TSAs, etc.) that have no built-in safety buffer.. Sectorisation may need to be optimized to better accommodate the new traffic flows. This is a particularly challenging task in case of time limited FRA implementation.. The lack of fixed routes increases the risk of blind spots, both within the area of responsibility and near the borders..
