Operation of an aircraft without a transponder, or with a dysfunctional one, constitutes a single threat with the potential to “pass” through all the existing safety barriers up to “see and avoid”. Transponder failure can occur due to a number of reasons. These can include incorrect input data, electrical faults, and simple SSR-transponder communication problems, such as a bit flip (a random and unintended change of an information bit value from 0 to 1 or vice-versa).
