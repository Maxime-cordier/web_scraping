Mitigation barriers are designed to reduce the impact of the event after it has already happened. A mitigation barrier is called “repairable” when a failure has reduced the effectiveness of a barrier in the system, but certain actions may still be able to restore the effectiveness of this barrier. The main repairable mitigation barriers types are: Application of transponder code validation procedures on first contact;. More effective flight plan data;. Tactical conflict management: Regular air situation scanning by ATCO; Use of primary radar data, if available; Detection of transponder failure by flight crew; Built-in alerting functions for the transponder failure at the flight deck Built-in alerting function in the automated ATM system issuing warning when under specific circumstances the surveillance track data, and respectively, the track to flight plan correlation is lost.. Regular air situation scanning by ATCO;. Use of primary radar data, if available;. Detection of transponder failure by flight crew;. Built-in alerting functions for the transponder failure at the flight deck. Built-in alerting function in the automated ATM system issuing warning when under specific circumstances the surveillance track data, and respectively, the track to flight plan correlation is lost.. The total loss of transponder information may sometimes be mitigated by the availability of primary radar data. However, if false primary tracks appear too often, a “real” track may be considered to be fake. This is especially true when no other data is available (e.g. information from the previous sector).
