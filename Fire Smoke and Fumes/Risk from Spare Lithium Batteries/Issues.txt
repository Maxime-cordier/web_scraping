Two characteristics of lithium batteries explain how passengers and cargo must be protected from harm during commercial air transport flights. Cells within all lithium batteries are capable of self-ignition and entering a thermal runaway state. Moreover, recent trends in aircraft incident data show that technological advancements and new uses of lithium batteries require continual attention. Aviation professionals, passengers and other stakeholders must periodically update their knowledge and skills to effectively mitigate this risk. This article supplements Aircraft Fire Risk from Battery-powered Items Carried on Aircraft to increase awareness of the following cabin-safety issues. Beginning around 2015, these issues emerged separately and led to new or revised international rules and guidance on best practices: As with previous generations of lithium batteries, PEDs and entirely new categories of devices, education and training on any unfamiliar subject become essential for stakeholders directly engaged in flight operations — especially aircraft crewmembers — and recommended for those who have indirect responsibilities. The scope of such new information includes current rules of carriage; awareness of the significance of a power rating (Watt-hours) of a battery or power bank; safe battery handling, charging and storage; enforcing safe passenger handling of lithium batteries; awareness of any national security regulations that prohibit power banks and spare lithium batteries in airliner cabins; and practicing current skills approved for fighting lithium battery fires in the cabin.
