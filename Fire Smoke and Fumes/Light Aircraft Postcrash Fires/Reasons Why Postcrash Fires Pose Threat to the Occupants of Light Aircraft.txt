While PIFs are generally a threat for the occupants of any aircraft, they are especially dangerous when light aircraft are involved because of the: High volatility and low Flash Point of aviation fuel – it is very easy for the fire to start and spread;. Close proximity of fuel to occupants - fuel tanks can be literally centimetres away from passenger compartments;. Limited escape time (less than 20 seconds) - as a consequence of the two points above;. Limited energy-absorption characteristics of small-aircraft airframes in crash conditions;. High propensity for immobilizing injuries (especially when combined with the limited time for leaving the aircraft);. Inability of airport firefighters and emergency response personnel to suppress PIFs in sufficient time to prevent fire-related injuries and fatalities;. Onboard handheld fire extinguishers being generally useless – they can be difficult to reach due to the damage the aircraft receives on impact and are not likely to contain sufficient quantity of chemical to extinguish an intense fuel-fed PIF;. Possible absence of cabin crew to help occupants escape;. Possible insufficient knowledge of occupants to perform actions that enable survival..
