The most effective defence against PIFs is to prevent a fire from occurring at, or just after, impact. This can be done by: Containing the fuel (e.g. designing the aircraft in such a way as to prevent the fuel from spilling into the cabin or the cockpit or by using reinforced fuel tanks). Ignition prevention (e.g. by using cut-off switches to render electrical components inert);. Both. Other defences include design concepts to: Provide adequate occupant restraint (reducing impact injuries);. Reduce deceleration forces applied to occupants by designing the airframe with more robust energy absorption criteria (reducing impact injuries);. Design passenger compartments to reduce or prevent occupant entrapment (providing easier egress);. Provide mechanisms for rapid egress.. Dissemination of information relevant to PIF risks can be helpful to amateur-built aircraft and ultralight communities.
