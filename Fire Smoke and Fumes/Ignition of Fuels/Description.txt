The flash point of a volatile liquid is the lowest temperature at which it can vaporise to form an ignitable mixture in air. Transportation regulations distinguish fuels as either flammable or combustible depending upon their flashpoint. Flammable fuels have a flashpoint below 38°C. and combustible fuels have a flashpoint above 38°C. As an example, diesel fuel flashpoints range from about 50°C. to around 100°C making it relatively safe to transport and handle. Gasoline, by comparison, has a flashpoint of minus 43°C. Sparks and static electricity can easily ignite gasoline fumes. Aviation fuels fall mainly into two categories, aviation gasoline - commonly abbreviated to “avgas” - and the variants of paraffin (kerosene) used by all gas turbine engines and loosely described as "jet fuel".
