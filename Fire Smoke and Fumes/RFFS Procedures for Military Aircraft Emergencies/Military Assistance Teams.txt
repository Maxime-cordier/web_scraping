In addition to general procedures, when an accident involving a military aircraft has occurred, the appropriate (usually the nearest) military installation should be notified. Once notified, the Military authorities will normally dispatch assistance teams which will include some or all of the following personnel, as appropriate: Base fire department personnel. Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel (tasked with disarming, removing and recovery of weapons, parts and residue). Military police. Medical personnel. Bio-environmental personnel (helps with the management of radioactive materials and decontamination). Mortuary personnel (assists with the recovery and identification of human remains). Information officer (releases information to news media representatives). Accident investigation board (depending on the situation this could be the only investigative body). Legal officer (advises and assists citizens in their claims against the government). Heavy equipment personnel (to remove the wreckage of military aircraft).
