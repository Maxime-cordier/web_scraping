Detection is achieved by means of linear pneumatic sensing systems, often referred to as fire loops, which are gas filled pipes routed around potentially abnormal heat sources. If the temperature in the vicinity of the sensing element rises, the electrical resistance of the core material decreases and a warning indication can be triggered. They are duplicated to allow for continued detection if a single loop in the system becomes faulty. An open loop due to a short circuit fault will be detectable during daily pre flight testing or by annunciation of a fault in service. Physical damage to a loop such as a ‘pinching’ may lead to a false fire warning but would also produce an independent fault annunciation. The same principles apply to the protection of auxiliary power units (APUs).
