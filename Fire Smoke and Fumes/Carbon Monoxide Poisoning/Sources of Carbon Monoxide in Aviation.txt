In aviation the most typical sources of CO are exhaust from: internal combustion engines (piston-driven aircraft, airside vehicles and ground servicing equipment); aircraft turbine engine exhaust; and, Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) exhaust. Although odourless and tasteless, CO produced from these sources will usually be mixed with other, compounds, gases and vapours that can be detected through smell and taste. CO will also be created from combustion of materials during an aircraft emergency involving fire. Whilst on the ground, CO produced externally to an aircraft can enter cabins and flight decks via open doors and hatches. It is also possible that exhaust gases from other aircraft (e.g. positioned in front whilst taxiing or waiting for departure) can enter unfiltered via the bleed air and air-conditioning system. Poorly designed and/or maintained aircraft, as well as damaged aircraft can result in CO, and other gases, entering the cabin and flight deck; either directly or via the air-conditioning system. This can occur both on the ground and in-flight.
