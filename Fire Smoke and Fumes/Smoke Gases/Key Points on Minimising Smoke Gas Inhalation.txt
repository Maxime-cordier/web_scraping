The resistance to inhalation of toxic gases is known to vary widely between individuals. However, as well as prompt ground evacuation (if available), the principal defences against succumbing to the effects are the same for everyone and are: Avoid inhalation of smoke as much as possible - keep head below any obvious (visible) accumulation of smoke gases;. Hold a piece of wet material over nose and mouth to filter out water soluble gases during inhalation. As well as some irritant gases, this will also be effective against one of the two immediately dangerous gases, hydrogen cyanide;. Minimise unnecessary activity so as to keep respiration levels as low as possible..
