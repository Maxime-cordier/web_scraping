Many battery types are categorised as Dangerous Goods in the applicable International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods (Doc 9284),and also in the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR). The DGR are intended as a field document and have no legal standing but have been developed from the ICAO Technical Instructions which are the legal framework and are compatible with them, although sometimes more restrictive. This categorisation as Dangerous Goods has been made because of the risk of fire from spontaneous battery ignition, whether batteries are installed in equipment at the time or not, and also because in some cases it is not possible to control any such ignition which might take place on aircraft using the fire control methods available. However, most of the batteries types carried by passengers for their personal use are routinely permitted under the “excepted quantities” provisions. The exact limits of such concessions may be more restrictive than the minimum provided by ICAO according to the domicile of a particular carrier, or according to rules set by the carrier itself. Permitted carriage is usually predicated upon quantity, type of flight (passenger or non-passenger) and, for passenger flights, whether the items are the cabin or checked baggage of passengers travelling on the same flight. Where spare or loose batteries are permitted, they must be carried or packed in such a way that they are protected from damage and short circuit. Short circuiting of any charged battery and subsequent overheating or sparking can occur if a metallic path capable of conducting electricity is established and maintained between terminals of opposite polarity.
