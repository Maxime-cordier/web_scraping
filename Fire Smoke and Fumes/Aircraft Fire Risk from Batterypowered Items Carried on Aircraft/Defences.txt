Carriers must make every effort to ensure that passengers are aware of the requirements for carriage of batteries in their cabin or checked baggage. This can be difficult to achieve and carriers are advised to have appropriate checks in place to detect the degree of non compliance. Particular attention should be given to the appropriate packing of spare batteries which must be individually not loose packed or in their original packaging. This can limit the hazardous effect of a single - and unpredictable - single battery internal fault.
