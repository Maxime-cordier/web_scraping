Although the majority of battery-powered wheelchairs carried in holds are powered by a gas-electrolyte which is non-spillable, incident experience suggests that the loading supervision associated with their carriage may not always achieve the necessary minimum standards. The essential requirements for hold stowage must be met if hazardous outcomes are to be avoided: It should be noted that the applicable ICAO Instructions do not require disconnection of non-spillable batteries because it is often very difficult to do and, if not done properly, can increase the risk of a fire. Only if deactivation cannot be achieved should disconnection be considered. If this is done, the battery terminals must be protected against short circuit, for example by the effective insulation of exposed terminals. If spillable batteries are encountered, reference should be made to the restrictions detailed in the Technical Instructions.
