be considered if the emergency response procedures of the aircraft operator provide for this.. Manoeuvring the aircraft after touchdown (or a rejected take off) so as to stop the aircraft into wind or beyond may be important since it can materially delay propagation of a wing fire towards the fuselage. This strategy is equally applicable to a fire that is still confined to the engine/nacelle since it could quickly spread to the wing. Consideration should be given to the ability of fire and rescue services to access the aircraft. It may also be preferable to deploy evacuation slides onto the runway rather than an uncertain surface at the side of the runway.. Some of the above advice on aircraft handling is contentious; if you have an opinion regarding this, please contact the Editor: editor@skybrary.aero The strategy adopted to survive a wing fire is very much a matter of judgment for the pilot in command at the time considering aircraft type-specific issues and procedures as well as the flight crew's best information or guess as to what is actually happening.
