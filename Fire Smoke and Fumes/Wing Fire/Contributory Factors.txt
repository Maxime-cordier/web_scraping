Engine Fire. An engine fire is normally detected and extinguished satisfactorily by the fire detection and extinguishing systems. However, if an associated engine failure or malfunction is explosive to the extent that it is not contained within the engine casing (i.e., an Uncontained Engine Failure), then a fire may spread to the wing and/or fuselage.
