Fire in the air is one of the most hazardous situations that a flight crew can be faced with. A fire can lead to the catastrophic loss of that aircraft within a very short space of time. Once a wing fire has become established, it is unlikely that the crew will be able to extinguish it. The article "Fire in the Air" deals with the subject of fire on board an aircraft, particularly hidden fires. This article considers the quite different subject of external fires, specifically wing fires, which are thankfully less common but equally as dangerous and about which there is very little guidance for crews. Most modern aircraft carry the majority of their fuel in wing tanks. If those fuel tanks or the associated pipes leak, or they are damaged, and fuel comes into contact with an ignition source, then fire can break out within, on, or under, the wing. While this article is titled "Wing Fire", the discussion is equally applicable to fires associated with tail mounted engines, undercarriage bays, and bomb bays - external to the cabin and usually inaccessible to the crew. It should also be borne in mind that whilst the liquid fuel that is often the primary cause of continuing wing fires, the risk of fuel-related ignition is generally considered to be much greater in respect of the fuel vapour which is given off by liquid fuel in the presence of adjacent free space, particularly if this is a confined space such as the ullage of partly filled fuel tanks.
