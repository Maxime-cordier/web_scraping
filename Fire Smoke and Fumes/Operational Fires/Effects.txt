The effect of an operational fire on an aircraft, its passengers and crew can vary from inconsequential to catastrophic depending upon the type and location of the fire, the success of the crew's attempts to identify the source of the fire, the success of the fire suppression equipment and procedures, and the ultimate outcome of any post landing event such as an Aircraft Evacuation.
