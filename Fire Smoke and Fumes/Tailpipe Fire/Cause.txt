A tailpipe fire is caused by an excess of fuel in the combustion chamber, the turbine or the exhaust nozzle that ignites. It can result in significant flames coming out of the engine exhaust or in smoke from either the exhaust or engine inlet. Although a tailpipe fire can be very dramatic, it rarely results in engine damage as it occurs in a part of the engine that is designed for very high temperatures. However, it is possible that the flames from a significant tailpipe fire could damage other aircraft components such as the flaps.
