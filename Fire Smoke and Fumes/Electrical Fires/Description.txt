Electrical fires on aircraft originate from electrical components. An imminent electrical fire often can be detected by indirect indications or alarm-system sensors before the fire ignites. It is also possible that electrical fires will remain hidden to the flight crew or cabin crew for a prolonged time. in those situations, the electrical fire may become apparent too late for crewmembers to take action to eliminate the threat. Because modern commercial transport aircraft typically contain miles of wire inside electrical cables, looms and wiring harnesses (most of them in hard to reach places) the most frequent cause of electrical fires is some type of insulation issue, such as: Worn insulation — Mainly due to ageing and exposure to heat, worn insulation may be more susceptible to catching fire from overheating; worn insulation also may fall off wires, exposing the metal conductor to short-circuiting risks;. Torn insulation — Tearing is typically due to improper cable installation that may lead to the cable being repeatedly under mechanical stress, ultimately resulting in the conductive metal being exposed;. Contaminated insulation — When soaked with oil from any source, insulation is also more likely to catch fire (e.g. from electrical overheating); and,. Breaks in insulation — Exposed metal conductors (wires touching) inside cables may result in a short circuit or an electrical arc or spark.. Imminent or smouldering/burning electrical fires may be indicated directly or indirectly by the following clues: Over-voltage warning. Higher than normal electrical load. Popped circuit breaker. White smoke and acrid smell of hot or burning insulation; note, however, that these clues may also be caused by cable/wiring insulation being burned by some other type of fire..
