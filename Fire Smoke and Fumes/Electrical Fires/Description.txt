Electrical fires on aircraft originate from electrical components. An imminent electrical fire often can be detected by indirect indications or alarm-system sensors before the fire ignites. It is also possible that electrical fires will remain hidden to the flight crew or cabin crew for a prolonged time. in those situations, the electrical fire may become apparent too late for crewmembers to take action to eliminate the threat.
