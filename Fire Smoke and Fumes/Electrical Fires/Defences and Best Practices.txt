Prevention is the best countermeasure against electrical fires, including these actions: When an in-flight electrical fire is suspected or indicated, common flight crew responses consider: (Note that this procedure may have the effect of recreating the original problem. On the other hand, lack of electrical power would require a no-flap landing, manually lowering the landing gear, no normal communication capability and no navigation capability, which could increase risk factors, especially if flying at night or instrument meteorological conditions. See Further Reading below for current best practices in designing emergency checklists for smoke-fire-fumes events.)
