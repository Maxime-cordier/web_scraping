Foam is the primary agent used for extinguishing aircraft fires. Foam fire suppressant consist of a combination of bubbles of a lower specific gravity than that of hydrocarbon fuels or water. The foam has strong cohesive qualities and is capable of covering and clinging to vertical and horizontal surfaces. Aqueous foam cools hot surfaces by its high water retention ability and can flow freely over a burning liquid surface to form a tough, air-excluding blanket that seals off explosive and flammable vapours from access to air or oxygen. Good-quality foam should be dense and long lasting, capable of resisting disruption by wind or draft, stable to intense thermal radiation, and capable of re-sealing in event of mechanical rupture of an established blanket.
