In general there are other special-use fire extinguishing agents available to airport fire fighting services. In particular, those agents used to combat Class D fires (Combustible metals), such as magnesium fires, are referred to as combustible metal agents. Under certain fire situations “wetting agents” also may be appropriate. These agents can be either in the form of liquid or powder. A wetting agent is defined as a chemical compound that, when added to water in proper quantities, materially reduces its surface tension, increases its penetrating and spreading abilities, and might also provide emulsification and foaming characteristics. These agents should not be mixed in any primary agent tanks.
