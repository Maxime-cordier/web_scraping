Firstly identify the type of fire. This is determined by the fuel being combusted. SOLID fuels such as paper/wood, fabric, plastic are best extinguished by H2O/Glycol extinguishers that will smother/saturate/cool the fuel. LIQUID fuels such as petroleum based fluids are best extinguished by smothering agents such as Dry Powder, CO2, Foam, BCF. But not water extinguishers. GAS fires are extinguished by smothering agents such as CO2, BCF or Fire Blanket. METAL fires e.g. batteries once burning are extremely difficult to control and can only be extinguished using specialized Gel agents that smother and cool after first attacking the fire with BCF. Aggressive fire fighting and timely communication is essential. In some airlines, the flight attendant who discovers the fire "owns" the fire - they are the primary fire fighter. The second flight attendant on the scene assumes the role of "communicator". The communicator's first responsibility is to make the rest of the cabin crew aware of the problem and they respond by bringing all of the fire fighting equipment to the site to back up the fight. Second (immediate) priority is to advise the flight crew. As soon as the flight crew is made aware of smoke in the cabin, they will go into the QRH Smoke/Fire checklist. Immediate actions may include turning off the cabin recirculation fans and going to override on the avionics blower and extract valves, in order to start eliminating the smoke, and turning the power to the galleys and cabin accessories off. Most critically, if the source of the smoke cannot be positively identified or the fire immediately extinguished, the flight crew may initiate diversion, ditching or landing off-airfield .
