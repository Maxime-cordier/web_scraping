Smoke may originate within the cabin in either open or hidden areas, from elsewhere in the pressure hull (holds, equipment bays), from an external ground fire source which either takes advantage of a structural breach of the pressure hull or a similar source which creates such a breach itself. Smoke, but more usually oil-based fumes, can also enter the cabin via the air conditioning system. However, this system is normally an essential element of smoke removal until either smoke generation reduces or ceases altogether or evacuation becomes possible. Switching it off during a cabin fire without introducing ram air has aggravated cabin fire smoke build up in past accidents and incidents; see for example the NTSB report on the Air Canada DC9 fire: DC93, en-route, Cincinnati OH USA, 1983
