Smoke within an aircraft fuselage during normal operations may arise from a number of causes. These include: failure of electrical equipment and short circuits in electrical wiring;. overheating of equipment due to malfunction of thermostats or other controlling devices;. leakage of very hot air from pneumatic ducts;. spillage of combustible fluid (hydraulic oil, glycol) on a hot surface;. overheating of galley ovens with subsequent spillages of hot food oils, fats and greases.. Smoke from fires which are the result of ground impact are usually fuel fed. Since the supply of fuel may be large, consequential smoke build up in the cabin can be rapid.
