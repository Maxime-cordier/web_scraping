The heat generated by any fire causes gases in the vicinity to increase in temperature and therefore to also expand. The forces which this creates are responsible for what is termed "buoyancy" in which the hot gases rise and flow away from the fire. Buoyancy is why hot gases in hidden areas are sometimes expelled through ventilation openings or any similar ‘leakage’ path. As hot gases rise up from a fire due to buoyancy, they begin to mix with ‘local’ air and cool down. This reduces buoyancy and therefore the upward mobility of the gases which tend to become layered or stratified. The pattern of smoke buoyancy and stratification in any particular fire can be affected by many variables, for example the ‘fuel’ which is feeding the fire, the burn rate of the fire, local environmental conditions, the geometry of the space containing the smoke and the extent of opportunities for smoke leakage.
