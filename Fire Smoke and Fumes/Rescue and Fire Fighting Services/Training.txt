ICAO Annex 14 directs that “All rescue and fire fighting personnel shall be properly trained to perform their duties in an efficient manner and shall participate in live fire drills commensurate with the types of aircraft and type of firefighting equipment in use at their aerodrome, including pressure-fed fuel fires”. It further states that the training curriculum should include initial and recurrent instruction in at least the following areas: a) Airport familiarisation; b) Aircraft familiarisation; c) Rescue and fire fighting personnel safety; d) Emergency communications systems on the aerodrome, including aircraft related alarms; e) Use of the fire hoses, nozzles, turrets and other appliances; f) Application of extinguishing agents; g) Emergency aircraft evacuation assistance; h) Fire fighting operations; i) Adaptation and use of structural rescue and firefighting equipment for aircraft rescue and fire fighting; j) Dangerous goods; k) Familiarisation with fire fighter’s duties under the aerodrome emergency plan; l) Protective clothing and respiratory protection. ICAO does not provide guidance on either training frequency or competency standards. As a consequence, there is variation in the type and frequency of training events among member States and there is likely to be a variance in the overall RFFS competency as well. It is also the case that in some parts of the world, inspections of fire fighting equipment sometimes find that the reductions in the serviceability of equipment, which reduce the Category of cover actually available, have not been followed by the required promulgation. The aircraft manufacturers provide detailed aircraft rescue and fire fighting charts for each of their products.
