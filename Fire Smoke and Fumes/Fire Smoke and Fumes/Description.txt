Confirmed Fire on board an aircraft, especially when it is in flight, represents one of the most feared hazards in aviation. Fire in the air can ultimately lead to loss of control, either as a result of structural or control system failure, or again as a result of crew incapacitation; Fire on the ground can take hold rapidly and lead to significant casualties if evacuation and emergency response is not swift enough. Smoke or Fumes, whether they are associated with Fire or not, can lead to passenger and crew incapacitation and will certainly raise concern and invite a response. Finally, a Post Crash Fire, following an aircraft accident, accounted for approximately half of all fatalities in in the period 1999 - 2007 (UK CAP 776).
