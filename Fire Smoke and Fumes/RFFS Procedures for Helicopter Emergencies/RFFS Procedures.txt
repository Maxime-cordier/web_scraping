The information in this section is derived from RFFS handbooks. It is offered as suggested best practice and is not intended to supersede local instructions and procedures. All general RFFS procedures apply when dealing with a helicopter emergency. As well as those, there are a number of precautions to be followed to reduce helicopter-specific hazards: A helicopter should be approached in a crouching position, to avoid the main rotor, if the engines are running.. The presence of a ladder can be very helpful when dealing with a helicopter that is on its side.. If the pilot is conscious and able to give instructions, the helicopter should be approached in full view of the pilot following their guidance.. As a general rule a helicopter should not be approached from behind due to the danger that the tail rotor presents. An exception to this rule is the Chinook helicopter where, due to the pitch of the blades, the safest way to approach is from behind.. Under crash conditions when the pilot has been incapacitated it may be advisable to approach from the rear. In such cases RFFS personnel should keep to the opposite side of the tail from that of the stabilising rotor.. Engine air intake and exhaust efflux areas should be avoided.. On elevated terrain the helicopter should be approached from the downhill side.. Any tools should be carried low: ideally below waist level and never above the shoulder.. The helipad should be kept clear of loose articles that can be dislodged by rotor wash and potentially cause damage or injury..
