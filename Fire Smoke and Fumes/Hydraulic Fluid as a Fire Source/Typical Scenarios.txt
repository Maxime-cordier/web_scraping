After a high speed rejected takeoff, brake temperatures on a large, heavy aircraft exceed 700 degrees C. Hydraulic fluid from a crack in a brake line leaks onto the hot brake and ignites. The fire is extinguished by the RFFS that had responded to the rejected takeoff.. An undetected “dragging” brake during the takeoff roll results in very hot brake temperatures once the landing gear has been retracted. Hydraulic fluid from a leak in the landing gear actuator assembly ignites. The ensuing wheel well fire results in the structural failure of the wing before the aircraft is able to land..
