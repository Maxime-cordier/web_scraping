A hydraulic drive system consists of the hydraulic fluid plus three major mechanical components. These components are the “pressure generator” or hydraulic pump which can be driven by an electric motor, an engine or a manual pump, the system “plumbing” consisting of valves, filters and pipes and the “motor” which could be a hydraulic motor, hydraulic cylinder or hydraulic actuator. Virtually all aircraft have hydraulic systems of some description. In small, general aviation aircraft, the hydraulic components may be limited to wheel brakes. In larger aircraft, hydraulic systems can also provide the motive power for many other systems including nose wheel steering, landing gear retraction/extension, flap and slat retraction/extension, flight control actuation, emergency electrical generation and other ancillaries such as airstairs and cargo doors.
