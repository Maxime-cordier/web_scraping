The search for Halon alternatives for use on aircraft has been in progress for at least 20 years and has only recently led to potential success in the form of the product marketed as 'Halotron'. Extinguishing agents in common use generally are either formulations based on sodium bicarbonate - suitable only for fires involving flammable liquids and gases - or those known as ‘ABC’ which are usually based upon ammonium phosphate and are suitable for use on fires of all origins. Both types may be used safely on fires where electrical circuits are present. However, although these types are the most effective fire extinguishing agents in general use, they both leave a very fine, powdery residue after discharge which includes particles of sub-micron diameter which is difficult if not impossible to clean up. This makes them unsuitable for use on or in the vicinity of complex and often sensitive aircraft electrical systems. The ‘option’ of returning to the use of the far less effective dual extinguisher-type solution of Carbon Dioxide and Water Glycol has not found favour either. Although Carbon Dioxide, as an extinguishing agent, is both ‘clean’ and much cheaper than both Halon or potential Halon replacements, its overall effectiveness per unit of stored volume is significantly worse than that of Halon. In addition, it cannot be used on solid material fires and the method of achieving effective discharge on other fires is also more complicated, requiring a tube to horn delivery rather than nozzle discharge. Halon 1301, historically used in extinguishing systems on all Engines/APUs fitted to civil transport aircraft is no longer manufactured and has been banned (for new systems) since 1994; often they are now replaced by HFCs (Hydrofluorocompounds).
