The uncontrolled loss of bleed air from the pneumatic system or from any of the pneumatically powered services has the potential to cause: damage to aircraft wiring. components to overheat. damage to aircraft structures. inflight fire.. Even after the the bleed air leak has been secured using the appropriate electronic centralized aircraft monitor (ECAM), quick reference handbook (QRH) or aircraft flight manual (AFM) procedure, secondary effects of the original fault may occur. Isolating part of the bleed air system will inevitably lead to some degradation in the operation of other aircraft systems such as: pneumatically-operated control surfaces. air driven hydraulic pumps. air conditioning/pressurisation systems. anti-icing systems.. Managing the remainder of the flight with the loss of some or all of these systems will require careful thought and planning. Having a comprehensive knowledge of the pneumatic systems in the aircraft will help in the decision making process. It is essential that the pilots understand what is working and what is not as well as the consequent limitations to the operation.
