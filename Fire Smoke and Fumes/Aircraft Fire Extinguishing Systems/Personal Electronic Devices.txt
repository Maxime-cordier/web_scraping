Equipment has been introduced designed to deal specifically with lithium battery fires in PEDs; lithium ion batteries (Li-ion) are used to power PEDs such as cellular phones, portable tablets, EFBs and digital cameras; Li-ion batteries are rechargeable. Non-rechargeable lithium batteries (Li-metal) are similar to Li-ion, but use a different electrode material – metallic lithium. All lithium batteries present a potential fire hazard. These batteries are carried on aeroplanes as cargo, within passenger baggage, and by passengers directly. Like some other batteries lithium batteries are capable of delivering sufficient energy to start an in-flight fire. Lithium batteries present a greater risk of an in-flight fire than some other battery types because they are also unable to contain their own energy in the event of a catastrophic failure. Once extinguished, a lithium battery fire – or a fire in a PED powered by lithium batteries – requires containment and continued cooling. Halon 1211 or water fire extinguishers are effective at extinguishing the fire and preventing its spread to additional flammable materials. After extinguishing the fire, dousing the electronic device with water or other non-alcoholic liquids cools the device and prevents additional battery cells from reaching thermal runaway. Containment devises are now available and where these are equipped, crews should receive specific training in how to use them to greatest effect. These issues are discussed in some detail in the RAeS document "Smoke, fire and fumes in transport aircraft, past history, current risks and recommended mitigations - Part 1:References".
