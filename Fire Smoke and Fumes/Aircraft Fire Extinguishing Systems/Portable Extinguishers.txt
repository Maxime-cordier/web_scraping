Fires on board aircraft which occur within the aircraft cabin or flight deck - or are potentially directly accessible from them - arise in one of three ways: Portable extinguishers present a special challenge since they must be capable of extinguishing a range of fire types - solid materials such as cabin fixtures and furnishings, flammable liquids and electrical fires. Halon 1211 extinguishers have entirely replaced the previous combination of two different types of portable extinguisher - carbon dioxide and water gycol - on new-build aircraft and no other single extinguisher-type has yet been identified as a satisfactory alternative to it. NOTE: Crews must be aware that the toxicity of the Halon gases, especially the combination which makes up Halon 1211, is such that use in confined spaces requires care to minimize any inhalation of the discharged gases. Where a portable Halon extinguisher is used by cabin crew, it is usually recommended to consider donning a smoke hood before discharge to eliminate this risk, but for flight crew use on the flight deck, this will not be an option and risk awareness is the only defence. Where the dual fit of extinguisher is encountered on older aircraft, it is essential that Water Glycol extinguishers are used on solid material fires and Carbon Dioxide extinguishers on liquid or electrical equipment fires. The minimum dispatch requirement for aircraft portable fire extinguishers is determined by the capacity of the aircraft cabin and is specified in the Aircraft MEL. Relevant authorities (e.g. the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in the EU, FAA in the US) specify the requirements for hand held fire extinguishers in terms of:
