The most important basic function of any smoke hood is the ability to convert toxic carbon monoxide to relatively harmless carbon dioxide through a catalytic process. Most smoke hood designs also use some form of activated charcoal filter to screen out corrosive gases, such as those of ammonia and chlorine, and acid gases, such as hydrogen chloride and hydrogen sulphide. The temperature of inhaled gases must also be maintained within acceptable limits.
