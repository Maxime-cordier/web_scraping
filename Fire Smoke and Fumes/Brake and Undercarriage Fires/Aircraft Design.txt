Brake systems must be designed with sufficient capacity to absorb the amount of kinetic energy that the aircraft type can generate in the worst case situations. The design must consider and test the following scenarios throughout the defined wear range of the brakes: Following these high kinetic energy stop test scenarios, with the parking brake promptly and fully applied for at least 3 minutes, it must be demonstrated that for at least 5 minutes from application of the parking brake, no condition occurs, including fire associated with the tire or wheel and brake assembly, that could prejudice the safe and complete evacuation of the airplane. Means must also be provided in each braked wheel to prevent a wheel failure, a tire burst, or both, that may result from elevated brake temperatures. This requirement is normally met by installing a fusible plug in the wheel.
