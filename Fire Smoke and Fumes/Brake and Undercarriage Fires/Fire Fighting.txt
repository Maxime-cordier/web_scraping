Whilst the usual strategies for cooling "hot" brakes include use of a remote location, parking into wind, chocking the nose wheel, releasing the parking brake, and use of brake fans when available, should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Declaration of an emergency, shut down of the aircraft and evacuation of passengers and crew will normally take place. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly both laterally and in a fore and aft direction. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted obliquely on a 45 degree angle to the tyre sidewall. Most manufacturers recommend water misting to cool an overheated wheel assembly but, in the event of a fire, more aggressive intervention such as water cannon, foam or halon might be used.
