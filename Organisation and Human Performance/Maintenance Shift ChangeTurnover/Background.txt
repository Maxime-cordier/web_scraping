Shiftwork is used extensively in commercial air transport maintenance operations. Many operations run two — usually eight or nine hour — shifts per day, although large airline operations may run three shifts per day. In situations in which aircraft maintenance technicians or engineers are working shifts or duty periods that conflict with their natural circadian rhythm, or if they work more than one shift in succession, or multiple shifts in just a few days, fatigue is a significant risk. Another risk to be considered and mitigated involves the passing of incomplete work tasks or assignments from an outgoing shift to the incoming shift. Without effective shift change procedures and communications, the risk of errors increases and can threaten the safety of subsequent flight operations.
