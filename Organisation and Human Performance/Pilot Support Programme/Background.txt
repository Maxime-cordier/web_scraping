The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) convened a Task Force after the Germanwings accident in March 2015. Recommendation 6 of the Task Force’s report published on 16 July 2016 (see Further Reading below) stated ‘The Task Force recommends the implementation of pilot support and reporting systems, linked to the employer Safety Management System within the framework of a non-punitive work environment and without compromising Just Culture principles. Requirements should be adapted to different organisation sizes and maturity levels, and provide provisions that take into account the range of work arrangements and contract types’. A requirement for operators to implement and maintain a pilot support system was introduced through Commission Regulation 2018/1042 of 23 July 2018 (amending Regulation (EU) No 965/2012).
