The size and diversity of an airlineâ€™s fleet, or the range of aircraft a maintenance organisation is contracted to work on have a direct impact on workload. It is common for airlines to operate several types, models and generations of aircraft. This requires a broad-range of skills, knowledge and experience. Ageing aircraft require increased inspection activities and maintenance tasks which increases workload whilst new aircraft present ever-increasing complex and new technologies.
