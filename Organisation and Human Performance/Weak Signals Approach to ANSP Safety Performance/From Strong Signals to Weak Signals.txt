Every organisation, especially those in safety critical environments, has a particular interest in finding out whether it operates within an acceptable level of safety. A common approach is to take “after the event data”,especially data that strongly reflect what just happened, typically an accident or an incident. These are situations where the variability of daily performance exceeds a normal range and therefore becomes a strong signal, visible to everyone. This data is commonly compressed into safety indicators, frequently labelled as lagging indicators. This type of safety approach remains reactive and the conclusions are biased by hindsight. Most of the data comes from events that occur very rare, sometimes never and most of the effort and resources are spent for those events. However, only very little information is being taken to analyse everyday scenarios that happen all the time. Following this approach, the distribution of safety data will be inverted because the validation of every day events will now become the prevailing safety data. EUROCONTROL set up a project called ”Weak Signals in ANSP´s safety performance” which started at the end of 2011 and is a collaborative work of EUROCONTROL, DFS, various universities and research institutes. The aim is to evaluate a new safety performance paradigm leading to a pro-active approach in safety management. According to the literature, "weak signals" can be seen as a kind of early signs providing information about the local adaptations and the system status. One of the main objectives of this research project is the development of a framework and to test its application and the possibilities of integration into an ANSP´s monitoring system. According to the RE point of view this will give the opportunity to act pro-actively before malfunctions or serious harm happens.
