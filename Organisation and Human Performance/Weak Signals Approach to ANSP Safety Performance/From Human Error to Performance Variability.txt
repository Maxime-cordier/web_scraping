Human error can only be seen as a failure when the outcome is known and considered unwanted. As long as the outcome suits the expectations and remains within the prescribed safety margins, the decision that is undertaken is not considered wrong or an error. RE acknowledges the under-specification that operational employees are often confronted by and attempts to gain a deeper understanding which is oversimplified by a label such as “Human Error”. Working conditions are characterised by changing demands and degraded modes of the system, requiring the ability to react flexibly under changing conditions. Due to these characteristics, human performance has to vary in order to meet actual demands and challenges. Not every situation can be covered by a procedure or a rule. Adjustments are vital and necessary. Contrary to this notion, technical systems do not vary widely because they basically work or do not work. In the case of a malfunction, the component in question will be replaced by another technical component. However, complex systems do not function in a bimodal way. What is valid for technical components does not apply to the nature of complex socio-technical systems. Performance variability is necessary and crucial. And because the adjustments of tasks and activities are shadowed by uncertainty and under specification, they are inevitable approximate. These human adjustments are the reason why in the everyday operational work, things often turn out well and sometimes they do not. As far as humans or organisations are concerned, the bimodal notion of functioning is not only inappropriate but also wrong. Ernst Mach (1905) summarized the idea of performance variability over 100 years ago in his book “Erkenntnis und Irrtum”: “Knowledge and error flow from the same mental sources, only success can tell one from the other”
