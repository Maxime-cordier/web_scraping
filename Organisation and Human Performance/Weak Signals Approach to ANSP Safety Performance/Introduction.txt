“Creating foresight”, “anticipating future threats” and “how to be prepared for possible future surprises” are fundamental issues in managing today’s complex socio-technical systems. Traditional safety approaches use after-the-event data to evaluate the organisation’s safety level. This is based on the theoretical understanding that safety is seen as the absence of unwanted consequences. Consequently, managing safety is seen as the avoidance or elimination of negative outcomes. This safety approach follows the credo of improving safety by learning from errors and mishaps. Organisations with this understanding may learn from past events, but hardly pro-actively anticipate future threats. In the current complex socio-technical systems, traditional theories of safety that follow a structural view and focus only on the negative limit the understanding of the interactive complexity and dynamics are inherent in such systems. Only finding and counting human errors, failures or breakdowns is no appropriate way to get a better insight of how today´s systems work and possibly fail. A better understanding of the interactions and couplings of system components is necessary. The following presentation illustrates the traditional approach of managing safety.
