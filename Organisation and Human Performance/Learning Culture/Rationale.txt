An organisation, a company or a flight department, that has a Learning Culture is one that encourages continuous learning. The resultant environment of continual learning elevates the individual employee as a person, as a worker and as a professional. This, in turn, can open opportunities for the organisation, the company or the flight department, to continuously evolve for the better.
