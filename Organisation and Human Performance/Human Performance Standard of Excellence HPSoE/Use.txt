Initial assessments against the HPSoE have been undertaken by 14 ANSPs of differing sizes encompassing different scale and complexities of operations. They believe that the HPSoE will help them to determine: Their current level of human performance. Their target level of human performance. The actions required to sustain and / or improve human performance. The HPSoE could therefore be a useful tool for ANSPs to assess their human performance status and to show the general level of human performance for the industry.
