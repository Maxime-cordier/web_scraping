NOSS is intended as a safety management tool for the SMS of the organisation. NOSS is founded on scientific principles and, in particular, on the Threat and Error Management (TEM) framework. NOSS is a method developed for application in the operational environment. Rather than being a tool to assess individual controller behaviour or controller productivity, NOSS will provide the organisation with a picture of the most pertinent threats and errors in a specific operation, how they are managed and how effectively any resulting undesired states are managed during normal ATC operations.
