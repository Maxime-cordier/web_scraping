Normal Operations Safety Survey (NOSS) is a phrase which has been applied to a methodology for the collection of safety data during normal air traffic control (ATC) operations. A "normal" ATC operation is defined as an operation during which no accident, incident, or event takes place which would require reporting and/or investigation under existing legislation or regulations. Training and check shifts are considered to be outside the scope of normal operations. By conducting a series of targeted observations of ATC operations over a specific period of time, and the subsequent analysis of the data thus obtained, the organisation is provided with an overview of the most pertinent threats, errors, and undesired states that air traffic controllers must manage on a daily basis. One feature of NOSS is that it identifies threats, errors and undesired states that are specific to an organisation's particular operational context, as well as how those threats, errors and undesired states are managed by air traffic controllers during normal operations. The information thus obtained will enhance the organisation's ability to proactively make changes in its safety process without having to experience an incident or accident.
