CISM is an interlocking and comprehensive peer-based programme to support colleagues after experiencing a critical incident. The aim is to manage the stress reactions caused by the critical incident and restore the individual's ability to work. A critical event is not defined by the severity of the event, but always refers to the individual reactions of the person affected. The internationally recognized definition of a critical incident is therefore: A critical incident is any situation that causes a person to experience unusual strong stress reactions that the person perceives as disturbing or disabling.
