By using the HFACS framework for accident investigation, organisations are able to identify the breakdowns within the entire system that allowed an accident to occur. HFACS can also be used proactively by analyzing historical events to identify reoccurring trends in human performance and system deficiencies. Both of these methods will allow organisations to identify weak areas and implement targeted, data-driven interventions that will ultimately reduce accident and injury rates. HFACS provides a structure to review and analyze historical accident and safety data. By breaking down the human contribution to performance, it enables the analyst to identify the underlying factors that are associated with an unsafe act. The HFACS framework may also be useful as a tool for guiding future accident investigations in the field and for developing better accident databases, both of which would improve the overall quality and accessibility of human factors accident data. Common trends within an organisation can be derived from comparisons of psychological origins of the unsafe acts, or from the latent conditions that allowed these acts within the organisation. Identifying those common trends supports the identification and prioritization of where intervention is needed within an organisation. By using HFACS, an organisation can identify where hazards have arisen historically and implement procedures to prevent these hazards which will result in improved human performance and decreased accident and injury rates. The US Navy was experiencing a high percentage of aviation accidents associated with human performance issues. Using the HFACS framework, the Navy was able to identify that nearly one-third of all accidents were associated with routine violations. Once this trend was identified, the Navy was able to implement interventions that not only reduced the percentage of accident associated with violations, but sustained this reduction over time.
