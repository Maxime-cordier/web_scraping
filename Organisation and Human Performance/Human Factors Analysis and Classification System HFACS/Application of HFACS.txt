While the first use of the HFACS framework occurred in the US Navy where it originated, the system has spread to a variety of industries and organizations (e.g. mining, construction, rail and healthcare). Over the years, the application reached civil and general aviation. Organizations such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration have explored the use of HFACS as a complement to pre-existing systems.
