Present findings on night and shiftwork prove a higher risk of physical and mental impairments for employees working in atypical shift systems as compared with employees with regular working hours. The increased risk of impairments arises from the following factors: The de-synchronisation of working time combined with different working requirements. The capability according to the physiological and social conditions.. The study established that: The risk increases from early to late shift and is highest during the night shift.. The risk increases until the seventh successive shift.. During day shift, a break is due, at the latest, after four hours. Tasks demanding high levels of vigilance should be followed by a break after two hours. The minimum duration of a break should be ten minutes plus five minutes for every hour worked.. During night shift, the risk of fatigue is even more enhanced since the employee is working against the circadian rhythm. Special considerations might be taken into account for breaks that may allow napping and enough time to overcome the subsequent inertia.. The design of night shifts generally should take into account the variability of real life settings compared to laboratory settings - this for example refers to experiments measuring reaction times (laboratory) which do not fully reflect the variability of work demands in the actual night work situation.. The demands for designing rosters for night shift support the European Directive 93/104 which restricts the night shift to eight hours..
