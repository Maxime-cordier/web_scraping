There are reliable scientific findings that working at night causes a de-synchronisation of body functions. Human beings are day-active creatures, who are programmed to perform and be active during the day and to recover during the night. The problem arising from rotating shift systems, especially if night shifts are included, is the activation of the employees against their body clock. They have to work during the nights and to rest during the day. The increased physical stress by working nights manifests itself in: The reduced efficiency leads to: Night shiftworkers frequently mention troubles with body functions that are related to the circadian rhythm. The following are often expressed: A workerâ€™s age is another crucial factor. The older employees are, the more difficult is the adaptation to night work. A phase model developed by EUROCONTROL describes shiftwork throughout a working career: The following list summarises the problems faced by shiftworkers in working shift:
