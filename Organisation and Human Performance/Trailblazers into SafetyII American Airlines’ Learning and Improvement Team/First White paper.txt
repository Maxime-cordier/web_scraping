To catalog its journey, learned experiences, and challenges, LIT members authored a paper titled, “Trailblazers into Safety-II: American Airlines Learning and Improvement Team (LIT).” During initial discussions with Professor Erik Hollnagel, it was agreed that LIT develop its own language and model for data collection to provide initial direction and a vector for development efforts. LIT’s language comprises the four resilience potentials (Hollnagel, 2017) and each is specified in terms of a subset of proficiencies. The language is rooted deeply in Safety-II and accounts for aspects unique to American Airlines and the modern airline flight deck environment. The proficiencies are observable performance indicators that can be captured during flight deck observations. This data collection allows flight operations and individual pilots to learn from everyday operations. LIT continues to collect flight observations (over 100 captured) on regularly scheduled flights. Data collected has been analyzed and used to improve the flying operation, including providing content for a new Captain Leadership Development course. In addition to flight deck observations, another set of data collection includes facilitated discussions with line pilots. Known internally as Shop Talk, these informal discussions between a LIT member and line pilot occur in a one-on-one setting and provide a forum for pilots to share experiences and learning between each other. The format serves as an opportunity for American to learn about the challenges facing front-line pilots and how they address them. AA sees tremendous opportunity and value in this data stream. The white paper concludes with work completed in December 2019 and the subsequent paper will highlight progress made since the first paper. Some of the challenges and lessons learned are highlighted below.
