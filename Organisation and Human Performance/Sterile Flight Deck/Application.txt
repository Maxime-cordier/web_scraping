Regardless of regulation, many operators have chosen voluntarily to apply similar rules within their company. Where introduced, these proactive moves have been widely adhered to and recognised as a valuable contribution to operational flight safety. Some operators use surface to 18,000 feet as the "sterile zone", while others apply the sterile cockpit principle from Top of Descent/Pre-Descent checklist, in the descent, and up to Top of Climb/En-Route checklist, on departure. Exact interpretation of what constitutes the "sterile zone" is influenced by aircraft type, role, and operating environment. In military transport operations, a similar philosophy is applied from "combat entry" to "combat exit".
