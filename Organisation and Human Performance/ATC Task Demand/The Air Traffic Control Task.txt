On the basis of different information sources (e.g., radar screen, paper or electronic flight progress strips, radio and interphone communication), air traffic controllers have to control complex, dynamic, and time-constrained traffic situations in order to identify potential conflicts and risky relationships between aircraft and to be able to resolve them. Therefore, they have to perceive, comprehend, and anticipate multiple characteristics and flight paths of many aircraft while new incoming aircraft create new traffic relationships for evaluation. Diagnosis, decisions on future cognitive activities, and actions are based on these insights into current and anticipated structures of the changing situation. In an ATC environment, the term situation awareness describes the mental representation of the current and future traffic situations. There have been numerous studies conducted in the past years analysing the relations between ATC task demand factors and human performance in ATC. The results of this research is summarised in guidelines which are used by many ANSPs to derive absolute values, such as “controller workload” or “sector capacities”.
