The role of the ATCO is to ensure the safe and expeditious flow of air traffic through the airspace for which they have responsibility. A controller must remain alert and effective throughout that part of their assigned shift which involves operational duty, ready to cope with unexpected or unforeseen situations such as the consequences of aircraft emergency declarations or extreme weather conditions. The workload of a controller must be accurately assessed to permit optimum efficiency. If it is too high for too long, they may be overstretched. If it is too low for too long, this not only constitutes an inefficient application of resources but is likely to increase the chances of a controller becoming distracted from their primary task.
