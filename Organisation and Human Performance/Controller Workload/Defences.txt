Airspace is divided into sectors of responsibility sized according to the capability of a single controller.. These sectors must be capable of being combined or split, on a tactical basis, where traffic levels are subject to significant variation from the sector design assumptions.. Controllers are provided with Safety Nets and back-up teams to support their work.. Shift patterns are designed to ensure that controllers can have sufficient rest and to reflect the different off duty rest issues for night-time and daylight duties.. Each working duty contains appropriate breaks to allow controllers to rest and, if necessary, to recover after periods of high workload.. SOPs properly define hand-over procedures so that an on-going controller is fully briefed before taking over a position.. Ensure that all aspects of on the job training (OJT) are governed by effective SOPs.
