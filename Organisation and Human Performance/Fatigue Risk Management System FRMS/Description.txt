Historically, the aviation industry has taken a regulatory approach to fatigue prevention through the specification of flight and duty time limitations in a Flight Time Limitations (FTL) Scheme. This is done by limiting the number of hours aircrew can work and specifying the minimum rest time which is required before commencement of each flight duty period. The purpose of an FRMS is to support the safe application of such FTL Schemes by recognising the need for aircrew be adequately rested before commencing and during flying duties by facilitating both proactive and reactive interventions in relation to the implementation of FTL Schemes. It has been recognised through research that there are a number of causes of fatigue including: A fatigue risk management system allows operators to effectively utilises their FTL Scheme whilst taking into account the above effects. Fatigue models may be used to proactively. Demonstrated safety benefits have included increased crew member alertness, better work life balance amongst crews and a reduction in absenteeism attributed to fatigue. In addition to this, an FRMS may facilitate increased productivity and rostering flexibility. Computer models can be used to predict average performance capability from sleep/wake history and normal circadian rhythms. They can help operators understand the likely effects on performance of sleep obtained before and during trip patterns. An effective FRMS is data-driven and routinely collects and analyzes information and reports related to crew alertness as well as operational flight performance data. It helps to control the risk associated with both transient and cumulative fatigue. The FRMS can be established as a standalone system or as a part of the Safety Management System (SMS). Several examples of successful FRMS are in place today:
