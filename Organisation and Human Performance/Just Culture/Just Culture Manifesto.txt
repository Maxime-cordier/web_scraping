The Just Culture principles need to reach every country and every industry to help making Just Culture a reality in all organisations and societies. The Just Culture Manifesto presents five commitments critical for the need to balance safety and the administration of justice and invites people who agree with the Just Culture principles to commit to them. More information about the Just Culture Manifesto and the list with the people who have already joined it can be found at Just Culture Manifesto.
