In the years that have passed since the introduction of RVSM, the RMA has reported and assisted in the resolution of many ASE investigations. Between 2008 and 2010 alone, the RMA has had reason to investigate 157 individual airframes for non-compliant or aberrant ASE performance as well as 12 generic investigations into aircraft types. The most common causes of ASE to date include: Damage to static ports and pitot tubes. Pressure leaks in pitot/static pipes. Air data computers out of tolerance. Poor paint finish in static port sensitive areas. Adequacy of RVSM inspection procedures. Component life span. Non-optimised Static Source Error Corrections. Pressure variation caused by skin waviness effects.
