Flight level or altitude confusion is usually the result of the combination of two or more of the following factors: A common example of this is confusion between FL 100 and FL 110 (i.e. the pilot is cleared to fly at FL 110 but levels at FL 100, or vice-versa). ICAO standard phraseology is "FLIGHT LEVEL ONE ZERO ZERO" and "FLIGHT LEVEL ONE ONE ZERO"; Alternative non-standard phraseology used with success by a number of European air navigation service providers (ANSPs) is "FLIGHT LEVEL ONE HUNDRED", and some states have extended this phraseology to include "FLIGHT LEVEL TWO HUNDRED" and "FLIGHT LEVEL THREE HUNDRED". As a result, Regulation 2016/1185 stated that flight levels containing whole hundreds are to be pronounced as "FLIGHT LEVEL (NUMBER) HUNDRED". Similar confusion can occur at other flight levels or between altitudes, although it is much less common and FL100/110 confusion is both the most common and the most hazardous flight level confusion seen in Europe and North America.
