Actual or potential loss of separation sometimes occurs because an air traffic control (ATC) instruction is difficult or impossible to comply with in time, or is incorrect or inappropriate (e.g. the air traffic controller (ATCO) instructs the pilot to level at an altitude which creates a potential confliction). Strictly speaking, such an occurrence is not a Level Bust because the pilot does not fail to follow a received clearance. However, because the effect is the same, these situations are considered below for completeness.
