Pilot Workload. For example, the pilot confuses the altitude with another element of the message, for example: Flight is cleared to climb to FL220 at an airspeed of 200 kt and climbs to FL200; or, Flight is given a radar heading of 210 deg. and descends to FL210.. Flight is cleared to climb to FL220 at an airspeed of 200 kt and climbs to FL200; or,. Flight is given a radar heading of 210 deg. and descends to FL210.. ATC Expectation Bias: The pilot is expecting clearance to a particular flight level or altitude, because that was the level requested or because that is the usual clearance given. The pilot does not consciously notice the difference and climbs or descends to the expected level even though the correct level was read back. This can even happen when the cleared level has been written down.. Interruption or Distraction. For example, the pilot is distracted by irrelevant talk on the flight deck, bad weather, or an abnormal or emergency situation.. Poor cross-checking The normal crew cross-checking procedure does not take place so that, for example, the PNF fails to notice that the PF is levelling the aircraft at the wrong flight level or altitude. This can occur if a vertical clearance has been received while the PNF (or other flight deck crew member with monitoring responsibilities) is off-frequency (perhaps making a company call or visiting the washroom)..
