Selected altitude is one of the downlink data items transmitted in Mode S enhanced surveillance. Representation of selected altitude differs from one system to another but in most cases the data is shown in the track label (either as a separate field or hidden "under" another value, e.g. the cleared level but available by cycling between the two by e.g. the right mouse button). There is usually a warning (e.g. using a different colour) in case of mismatch between the cleared level and the selected altitude.

Availability of selected altitude information is beneficial in a number of ways: Notwithstanding the numerous advantages, the availability of selected altitude data is by no means a complete solution and overreliance should be avoided. In case of discrepancy between the Mode S selected level and the cleared level, the controller should clarify by the phrase "[CALLSIGN], CHECK SELECTED LEVEL, CLEARED LEVEL IS [level]".
