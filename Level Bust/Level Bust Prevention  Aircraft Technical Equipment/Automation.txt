Modern aircraft are equipped with automatic systems of various types. Automatic flight guidance (autopilot) and flight management systems vary widely between aircraft types and even between examples of the same aircraft type. Not only does equipment vary, but the underlying philosophy may differ from one system to another. Automatic systems carry out a number of complex tasks without direct pilot intervention, such as levelling the aircraft at a pre-set level and maintaining that level, or descending the aircraft to follow an instrument approach procedure. In carrying out these tasks the automatic system may adjust the aircraft power to maintain a constant speed. The safe and efficient operation of automatic systems relies on clear understanding, by the pilot, of the capabilities and the design philosophy of the equipment. Failure in this regard has resulted in several fatal accidents.
