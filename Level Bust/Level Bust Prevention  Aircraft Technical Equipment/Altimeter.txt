Requirements: These altimeters must be entirely independent so that the failure of any component in one system does not affect the other system. In modern flight decks the EFIS altitude displays are completely different to conventional altimeters, usually featuring a vertical altitude tape on the right hand side. Modern aircraft are also fitted with comparators which warn the pilots of any discrepancy between the output of the primary altimeters. A third independent standby altimeter is also fitted to assist in the gross resolution of any difference between the primary instruments, although this 'Standby Altimeter' is not required to be as accurate as the two principal altimeters.
