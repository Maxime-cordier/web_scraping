Modern aircraft are equipped with technical equipment designed to help the aircraft to level at and maintain a prescribed flight level or altitude. This equipment rarely malfunctions but, if it does, the aircraft may overshoot or deviate from the cleared level, leading to level bust if the malfunction is not quickly detected.
