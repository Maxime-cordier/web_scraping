The following types exclude involuntary transient departure from acquired levels attributable to the effects of turbulence: aircraft both accepts a clearance and sets/records it correctly but then does not follow it [flight management error (usual) or technical fault (rarely)]. aircraft accepts a clearance correctly but then sets it incorrectly without the error being picked up by the crew [flight management error]. aircraft reads back clearance incorrectly and this error is not picked up by ATC so it is then recorded/set and followed [ATC error]. aircraft is unable to react fast enough to a late reclearance and passes through new cleared level [ATC error]. See the scenarios in the separate article Level Bust - ATCO Induced Situations.. aircraft follows clearance with the wrong altimeter sub scale setting. aircraft departs cleared flight level without clearance to do so.. aircraft accepts a level clearance intended for another aircraft (call-sign confusion)..
