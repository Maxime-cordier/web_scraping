A Level Bust or Altitude Deviation occurs when an aircraft fails to fly at the level to which it has been cleared, regardless of whether actual loss of separation from other aircraft or the ground results. A Level Bust can result in Loss of Separation between aircraft or between an aircraft and the terrain or a ground obstruction such as a mast Controlled Flight Into Terrain CFIT. Level busts are becoming less dangerous because improvements in technology such as better Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) and Mode S have improved the ability of controllers to safely manage any consequent loss of separation. Furthermore, the availability and proper use of Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS) provides a final safety net which significantly reduces the risk of a Mid-Air Collision, and Terrain Avoidance and Warning Systems (TAWS) have also reduced the risk of a level bust resulting in a CFIT accident. The move to Flexible Use Airspace (FUA), the absence of ACAS on many military aircraft and the high performance of many military jet aircraft, means that the consequences of level busts involving military aircraft are more difficult to manage. A potential loss of separation resulting from the air traffic controller (ATCO) assigning an inappropriate altitude or flight level in a flight clearance does not constitute a level bust because no deviation from the flight clearance occurs; however for completeness, examples of situations in which the action of the ATCO could contribute to a level bust are listed in this article.
