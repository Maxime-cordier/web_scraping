It is surprisingly easy for flight crews to either forget, read back incorrectly, or read back correctly but then incorrectly set, instructions from ATC which have numbers in them e.g. those including frequencies, headings, speeds or altitudes. It can be observed during fam flights that it is a common occurrence for flight crews to write in the FMS scratch pad any such numbers during the transmission from ATC so that they are visibly retained, rather than solely relying on the human memory whereby they maybe forgotten, read back incorrectly, or incorrectly set.
