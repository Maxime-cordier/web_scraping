These commands are sent back to the ACEs from where they are sent to the flight control surfaces in the same manner as during Normal mode operations. Aircraft handling qualities are affected by the simplified computations or PFC control laws that are utilised in Secondary mode. While all flight control surfaces remain operative, the elevator and rudder are more sensitive at some airspeeds. The following functions are inoperative or degraded during Secondary mode operations: autopilot. auto speedbrakes. envelope protection. gust suppression. tail strike protection. thrust asymmetry compensation. yaw damping. Direct mode The ACEs automatically revert to Direct mode when they detect the failure of all three PFCs or when they are unable to communicate with the PFCs. Direct mode can also be manually selected by selecting the DISC position on the Primary Flight Computers Disconnect switch. In Direct mode, the PFCs no longer generate control surface commands. Pilot inputs are received by the ACEs and sent directly to the flight control surface actuators. Direct mode allows for full aircraft control while in flight and during the landing phase. Aircraft handling characteristics are very similar to those encountered while in Secondary mode. In addition to those functions lost during Secondary mode operations (as listed previously) the manual rudder trim cancel switch is inoperative. Mechanical Backup In the event of a complete electrical system shutdown, cables from the flight deck controls to the stabiliser and selected roll spoilers allow the pilots to maintain straight and level flight until the electrical system can be restored.
