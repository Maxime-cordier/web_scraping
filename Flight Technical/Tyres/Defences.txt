Aircraft Maintenance & Ground Manoeuvre: operating with the correct tyre pressures and maximising turn radii during ground manoeuvres can mitigate against a number of contributing factors associated with overheating and wear issues which can lead to tyre failure.. Procedures: managing taxi patterns, reduced taxi speeds and allowing sufficient cooling time when necessary can also obviate the issues associated with overheating. In-cockpit procedures for landing can also influence the occurrence of damage to the tyres.. Inspections: aircraft tyre inspections can identify a worn or damaged tyre that can subsequently be changed before it may explosively deflate or breaks-up, whilst airfield Foreign Object Debris inspections can reduce the possibility of undetected damage occurring after the inspection..
