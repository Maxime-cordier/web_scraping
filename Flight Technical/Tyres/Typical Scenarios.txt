Taxiing: Long taxi patterns at heavy weights with tight turns will generate a lot of heat in the tyres, even if the brakes are used sparingly. This could cause the heat fuses to melt, resulting in a controlled deflation of the tyre. Dependent upon a number of factors, including the remaining number of tyres on the aircraft, there may be restrictions on further aircraft movement prior to the wheel being changed. Take-off: High speed aborts generate a great deal of heat in both the brakes and the tyres and restrictions may need to be placed on the degree of ground movement that can be undertaken after an abort. The potential consequences of a high speed abort are, therefore, the melting of the heat fuses and the consequential impact as above. Take-off: Explosive deflation/break-up due to e.g. FOD can have catastrophic consequences. There is a great deal of potential energy stored in the tyre/wheel assemblies and multiple, unrelated system damage should be anticipated. An immediate landing will be the priority. Post take-off: Rapid retraction of the undercarriage following a long, high speed, heavy weight taxi with immediate take-off, or multiple touch-and-goes during crew training, can lead to the tyres overheating in the wheel well. The heat fuses should prevent an explosive deflation, but it is not guaranteed. The main problem with this event is that the crew are potentially unaware that they have an issue with the undercarriage until secondary effects start to occur during the landing run. Landing: A number of issues can arise from landing with a deflated tyre:
