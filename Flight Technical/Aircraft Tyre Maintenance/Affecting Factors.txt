There are three major factors that affect tyre performance: Centrifugal force. This is a combination of load and speed. Due to centrifugal force and inertia, the tread surface doesnâ€™t stop at its normal periphery but overshoots, briefly distorting the tyre from its natural shape. This sets up a traction wave in the tread surface. Traction wave is mostly affected by two factors - speed and underinflation. The result of traction wave exposure can be damaged tyre (e.g. groove cracking or rib undercutting).. Heat generation. Heavy loads and high speeds cause heat generation in aircraft tyres to exceed that of all other tyres. The physical properties of rubber compounds are susceptible to degradation by high temperatures. Both strength and adhesion are lost when the rubber reverts to the uncured state. Brief exposure to high temperatures is not as damaging to the tyre as are prolonged exposures. Internal heat ca cause tread and casing separations. External heat sources (e.g. brakes) can cause bead face damage.. Tensile, Compression and Shear Forces. An aircraft tyre is designed so that in the unloaded condition the internal tensile forces acting on each layer of fabric are uniform. Due to the high deflection of the tyre section under the load, the tensile forces on the outer plies will be higher than those on the inner plies. Due to the force gradient from outer to inner plies, shear forces are developed between the various layers of fabric. Underinflating or overloading a tyre will increase these shear forces, thus rapidly decreasing the life of an aircraft tyre. Common types of damage associated with these forces are shoulder separation and lower sidewall compression break..
