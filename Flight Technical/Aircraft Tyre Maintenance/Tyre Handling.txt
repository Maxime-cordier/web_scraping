Two types of demounting equipment are mostly used: “full-circle” and partial-circle bead breakers. With both types of bead breakers, the desired procedures are a combination of pressing against the tyre sidewalls close to the edge of the wheel flanges and controlling the lateral movement of the bead breaker rings after contacting the tyre sidewalls. This procedure assures the maximum lateral force against the tyre to demount it without internal tyre damage or kinking the tyre beads.
