Systematic inspection of mounted tyres is strongly recommended for safety and tyre economy. The frequency of the inspection should be determined by the use and normal tyre wear of the particular aircraft involved. With some aircraft, tyre inspection after every landing or at every turnaround is required. With all aircraft, a thorough inspection is advisable after a hard landing.
