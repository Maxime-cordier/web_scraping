Based on the type of plies used the tyres can be: Radial ply tires - these tyres feature a flexible casing which is constructed of rubber-coated ply cords which extend around the beads and are substantially at 90° to the centerline of the tread. The casing is stabilized by an essentially inextensible circumferential belt.. Bias ply tires - these tyres feature a casing which is constructed of alternate layers of rubber-coated ply cords which extend around the beads and are at alternate angles substantially less than 90° to the center line of the tread.. Based on the method for containing the inflation gas the tyres can be: Tube-type tyres - these require tubes for inflation retention.. Tubeless tyres - these do not require tubes. They are constructed with an innerliner (integral rubber lining that is engineered to prevent the diffusion of the inflation gas into the casing.)..
