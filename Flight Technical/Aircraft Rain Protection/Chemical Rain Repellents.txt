Water poured onto clean glass spreads out evenly. Even when the glass is held at a steep angle or subjected to air velocity, the glass remains wetted by a thin flm of water. However, when glass is treated with certain chemicals, a transparent flm is formed that causes the water to behave very much like mercury on glass. The water draws up into beads that cover only a portion of the glass and the area between beads is dry. The water is readily removed from the glass. This principle lends itself quite naturally to removing rain from aircraft windshields. A rain repellant system permits application of the chemical repellant by a switch or push button in the cockpit. The proper amount of repellant is applied regardless of how long the switch is held. This system should only be used in very wet conditions. If applied on dry windows, the undiluted repellant restricts window visibility. If the system is operated inadvertently, the windshield wipers should not be used as this tends to increase smearing. Any concentrated repellant or residue should be removed by a thorough fresh water rinse at the earliest opportunity. After application, the repellant film slowly deteriorates when flying in rainy conditions. This makes periodic reapplication necessary. The period between applications depends upon rain intensity, the type of repellant used, and whether windshield wipers are used. It should be noted that some types of chemical rain repellents are considered toxic and others, if overused, can cause damage to painted surfaces. For these reasons, many operators have chosen to disable the rain repellant systems on the aircraft in their fleet.
