There two basic types: mechanical switches and proximity sensors. Mechanical switches are easier to test; however, they fail more often because they rely on mechanical contacts to create the circuit. Proximity sensors do not utilize a direct mechanical contact but instead use circuitry to decipher when the magnetic field is interrupted. The proximity sensors are more reliable, but more difficult to troubleshoot. Most mechanical switches are either open or closed. Yet due to the circuitry of a proximity sensor it can be partially open and partially closed at the same time. So a proximity sensor that is known to be good but set to an incorrect clearance can cause very erratic behavior of other systems. Systems that are run through the WOW system are exclusively used either in the air or on the ground, not both.
