Most aircraft utilize some type of WoW sensor or switch that activates when the aircraft is on the ground. They come in many different sizes shapes and technologies and can be in various positions in the aircraft and landing gear. The one thing they all have in common is they complete the circuitry required to do many other things on the aircraft. A faulty or incorrectly adjusted switch/sensor may cause vital systems to not function or function intermittently. Systems that utilize the WoW system include but are not limited to, thrust reversers, nose wheel steering, trim and autopilot.
