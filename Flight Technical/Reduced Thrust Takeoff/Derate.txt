A derate selection electronically reduces the rated thrust of the engine to either one or more prespecified values or by a selectable percentage of the normal flat rated thrust. As this new thrust limit cannot be exceeded during the takeoff phase, critical speeds such as Vmcg and Vmca change from those associated with full rated thrust. Consequently the AOM must include performance data for all permissible derate selections.
