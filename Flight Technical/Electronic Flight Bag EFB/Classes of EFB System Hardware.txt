The first generation of EFB hardware-software systems was defined by reference to three levels of functional sophistication starting with Class 1: The EFB Classes 1, 2, and 3 were later eliminated and a simpler concept of portable and installed equipment was introduced, to harmonize with the ICAO and to accommodate increasingly complex systems integrating both installed and portable equipment: In order for portable EFB hardware to support EFB applications, installation of at least some components may be required, depending on requirements for positional integrity (e.g. installed mounts), continuity of power and data connectivity. Airworthiness regulations do not apply to portable EFB components other than for specifications associated with the installed components (i.e. mounting, power, and data connectivity).
