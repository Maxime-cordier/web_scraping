The term "Electronic Flight Bag" covers any portable electronic display hardware intended primarily for flight deck or cabin use. Some national aviation authorities (NAAs) now simplify their definition of electronic flight bag (EFB) as “any device, or combination of devices, actively displaying EFB applications.” ‘EFB devices’ can store and display a variety of aviation data or perform basic calculations for aircraft performance or fuel loading purposes. In the past, many of these functions were traditionally accomplished using paper references carried on board the aircraft or were based on data provided to the flight crew in various ways by an Operator’s ‘flight dispatch’ organisation. The goal is for a fully configured EFB system to be able to facilitate a paperless flight deck. The scope of the EFB system functionality may also include various other hosted databases and applications. EFB Hardware may use various technologies, formats, and forms of communication. Devices which function as an EFB may be referred to as an Auxiliary Performance Computer (APC) or as a Laptop Auxiliary Performance Computer (LAPC). EFB Hardware should be seen as part of an EFB system, in which the effectiveness of the hardware function is assured by its place in that system. It is expected that overall responsibility for maintaining the integrity of EFB systems will be specifically assigned. There is broad National Aviation Authority (NAA) agreement on the approach which will be taken in respect of EFB systems. The remainder of this summary is therefore generic and the detail may be found in the references given under ‘Further Reading’.
