Loss of hydraulic fluid due to severed pipes can lead to degradation in flight controls, loss of the ability to extend lift devices such as flaps or slats and the ability to raise or lower the landing gear in the normal fashion. These factors can have a great impact on approach speed, landing distance and go around performance and must be considered in the diversion decision.
