The first signs of carburettor icing are normally: Fixed Pitch Propeller - a reduction in available power measured by RPM. Constant Speed Propeller - a reduction in manifold pressure. If left untreated: Rough running engine. Vibration. Further loss of performance. ENGINE STOPS due to fuel starvation.
