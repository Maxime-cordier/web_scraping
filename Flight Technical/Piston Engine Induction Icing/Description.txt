There are 3 types of fuel induction system icing that may affect piston engines: Although “Carburettor Icing” is most likely to occur when the temperature and humidity are in the ranges indicated above, it can also occur under conditions not depicted. A more detailed chart is available in CAA AIC 077/2009 (see Further Reading). “Carburettor Icing” is much more likely at reduced power, so select carburettor heat before power is reduced for the descent, especially if you are intending to lift off again e.g. a practice forced landing or helicopter autorotation.
