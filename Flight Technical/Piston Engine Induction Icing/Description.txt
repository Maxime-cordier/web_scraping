There are 3 types of fuel induction system icing that may affect piston engines: Impact Ice. This is formed by the impact of moist air at temperatures between -10°C and 0°C on air scoops, throttle plates, heat valves, etc. It usually forms when visible moisture such as rain, snow, sleet, or clouds are present. Most rapid accumulation can be anticipated at -4°C. This type of icing can affect fuel injection systems as well as carburettor systems and is also the main type of icing hazard for turbocharged engines.. Fuel Ice. This forms at, and downstream from, the point that fuel is introduced into the carburettor when the moisture content of the air freezes as a result of the cooling caused by fuel vaporisation. It generally occurs between +4°C to +27°C, but may occur at even higher temperatures. It can occur whenever the relative humidity is more than 50%.. Throttle Ice. This is the most common, earliest to show and most serious carburettor icing. It is formed at or near a partly closed throttle valve (sometimes called the “butterfly valve”). The water vapour in the induction air condenses and freezes due to the venturi effect cooling the air as it passes the throttle valve. Since the temperature drop is usually around 3°C, the optimum temperature for forming throttle ice is between 0°C to +3°C although a combination of fuel and throttle ice could occur at higher ambient temperatures.. Although “Carburettor Icing” is most likely to occur when the temperature and humidity are in the ranges indicated above, it can also occur under conditions not depicted. A more detailed chart is available in CAA AIC 077/2009 (see Further Reading). “Carburettor Icing” is much more likely at reduced power, so select carburettor heat before power is reduced for the descent, especially if you are intending to lift off again e.g. a practice forced landing or helicopter autorotation.
