The speed indicated on an ASI is known as the Indicated Airspeed (IAS). It is the speed of the aircraft relative to the body of air through which it is flying. IAS is the speed of greatest interest to the pilot from an aerodynamic point of view. Although True Airspeed (TAS) varies with altitude and temperature, IAS does not; thus critical speeds such as stalling speed and structural limit speeds are constant regardless of ambient conditions. IAS depends on the density of the air, which varies with ambient temperature and pressure; thus, the IAS is only a measure of the speed over the ground in still air (zero wind) at sea level and in ISA conditions, i.e.: In all other conditions the IAS will differ from TAS to a greater or lesser extent, for example, at 30,000 ft the TAS is more than 50% higher than the IAS. Therefore, a calculation must be made to convert IAS to TAS. Instruments that record the TAS are also available, though uncommon in commercial aircraft. If the TAS exceeds about 300 kts, another factor comes into play. The air entering the pitot head becomes compressed, causing the ASI to overread by an amount which depends on the IAS and ambient conditions. This "compressibility error" can be corrected for if desired. Other errors in the system are reduced to an acceptable minimum by careful siting of the pitot tube and static vents, and by accurate calibration.
