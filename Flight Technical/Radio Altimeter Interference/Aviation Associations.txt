On 17 Nov. 2020, a letter (see References) from 14 U.S. aviation industry associations to members of the U.S. Congress said, in part, “Radar altimeters are deployed on tens of thousands of civil aircraft in the United States and worldwide to support several critical safety-of-life aircraft functions throughout multiple phases of flight. … Using technical information supplied by the mobile wireless industry and radar altimeter manufacturers, a quantitative evaluation of radar altimeter performance regarding RF interference from future 5G networks in the 3.7–3.98 GHz band was conducted [by the 5G Task Force formed by RTCA Special Committee 239], as well as a detailed assessment of the risk of such interference occurring and impacting safety. … We are concerned that without this congressional intervention [to protect the frequency bands used by radar altimeters and] to understand potential implications and ramifications, decisions will be made with a frightening lack of understanding of aviation requirements.”
