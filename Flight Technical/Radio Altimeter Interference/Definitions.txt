“5G … speeds will allow us to stream high-definition video in seconds and power innovations in fields like virtual reality. 5G will also reduce latency, or the delay that occurs when data is transmitted across distances, to nearly zero. This will allow autonomous vehicles to smoothly interact with each other and for advancements like remote surgery to be possible. And 5G networks will be able to handle 100 times the number of connected devices, enabling the Internet of Things and smart cities.”
