Hydraulic systems are subject to several significant threats. These include: System Overheat. The system exceeds its maximum allowable operating temperature and must be de-energized.. Loss of System Pressure. Loss of system pressure can occur in two different ways; loss of fluid or failure of a hydraulic pump.. Hydraulic Fluid Contamination. Contamination can be chemical or particulate in nature and can be caused during fluid production, by improper servicing of the hydraulic system or by a component failure..
