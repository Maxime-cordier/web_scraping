A transatlantic flight gradually loses hydraulic fluid from one of the hydraulic systems. When the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) annunciates the system Loss of Pressure, appropriate actions are completed to secure the system.The Captain contacts Company maintenance to discuss options. Due to the fact that there is no significant loss of aircraft capability due to system redundancy, that a few hours of flight time to destination remain and that there were ample diversion airfields enroute, it is decided to continue to the planned destination. The flight lands without further incident.. Just after top of climb, a turboprop aircraft suffers a complete loss of the Utility hydraulic system due to a rudder actuator failure. Controlability of the aircraft is not an issue as the Booster hydraulic system also provides pressure to the flight control surfaces. The Captain electes to make a turnback. An alternate (gravity) gear extension is carried out and a flapless approach and landing is made. The Auxillary hydraulic system is used to provide pressure for the brakes and full reverse propeller pitch is used to help bring the aircraft to a stop. The aircraft is shut down on the runway and then towed to the ramp..
