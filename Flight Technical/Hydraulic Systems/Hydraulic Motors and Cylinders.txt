Hydraulic motors and cylinders utilize pressurized fluid to do mechanical work. Hydraulic Motors. A hydraulic motor is a mechanical device that converts hydraulic pressure and flow into torque and angular displacement or rotation. Various types of hydraulic motors such as gear, vane and radial piston motors are available. On aircraft, hydraulic motors are most often used to drive jackscrews which can in turn be utilized to power flaps, stabilizer trim and some vertically extending landing gear applications such as found on the LOCKHEED C-130 Hercules aircraft.. Hydraulic Cylinders. A hydraulic cylinder, sometimes referred to as a linear hydraulic motor or a hydraulic actuator, is a mechanical actuator that is used to provide a reversible force in a single direction. The hydraulic cylinder consists of a cylinder barrel within which a piston connected to a piston rod ues hydraulic pressure to move back and forth. Aircraft applications include landing gear extension and retraction, cargo door operation and movement of flight control surfaces..
