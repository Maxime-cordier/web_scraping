According to the provisions in ICAO Annex 6 “Operation of Aircraft”, Vol I: Fixed-wing aeroplane and helicopters shall be equipped with a cockpit voice recorder with a recording duration of at least 30 minutes of its operation;. Fixed-wing aeroplanes with a maximum take-off mass of more than 5 700 kg and for which the certificate of airworthiness is first issued after 1 January 2003 shall be equipped with a CVR with a recording duration of two hours; and. Helicopters for which the certificate of airworthiness is first issued after 1 January 2003 shall be equipped with a CVR with a recording duration of two hours.. International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) recommends the following to Contracting States: A CVR, installed in aeroplanes of a maximum certificated take-off mass of over 5 700 kg for which the individual certificate of airworthiness is first issued on or after 1 January 1990, should be capable of retaining the information recorded during at least the last two hours of its operation. A CVR, installed in helicopters for which the individual certificate of airworthiness is first issued on or after 1 January 1990, should be capable of retaining the information recorded during at least the last two hours of its operation.. Additional ICAO provisions, in force from 1 January 2007, require that all aeroplanes which utilise data link communications and are required to carry a CVR shall record, on a flight recorder, all data link communications to and from the aeroplane. The minimum recording duration shall be equal to the duration of the CVR, and shall be correlated to the recorded cockpit audio. Also, sufficient information to derive the content of the data link communications message and, whenever practical, the time the message was displayed to or generated by the crew shall be recorded. CVR performance requirements are contained in the Minimum Operational Performance Specification (MOPS) document for Flight Recorder Systems of the European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE)).
