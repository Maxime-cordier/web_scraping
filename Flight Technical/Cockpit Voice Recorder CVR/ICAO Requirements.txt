According to the provisions in ICAO Annex 6 “Operation of Aircraft”, Vol I: International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) recommends the following to Contracting States: Additional ICAO provisions, in force from 1 January 2007, require that all aeroplanes which utilise data link communications and are required to carry a CVR shall record, on a flight recorder, all data link communications to and from the aeroplane. The minimum recording duration shall be equal to the duration of the CVR, and shall be correlated to the recorded cockpit audio. Also, sufficient information to derive the content of the data link communications message and, whenever practical, the time the message was displayed to or generated by the crew shall be recorded. CVR performance requirements are contained in the Minimum Operational Performance Specification (MOPS) document for Flight Recorder Systems of the European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE)).
