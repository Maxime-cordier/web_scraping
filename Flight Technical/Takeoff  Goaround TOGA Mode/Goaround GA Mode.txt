Another very important function of the TO/GA mode is to initiate the transition of the autopilot/autothrottle system from approach mode to go-around mode. Once on approach, with the manufacturer's arming conditions met (generally configuration and radio altimeter height dependent), pressing the TO/GA button or advancing the thrust levers to the TO/GA position will result in the auto-thrust advancing the engines to maximum available thrust, the approach mode disengaging and the flight director commanding a climb on the current heading. Activation of the TO/GA mode does not normally result in disengagement of the autopilot. If engaged, the autopilot will follow the flight director commands at an appropriate speed. Pilot selections on the MCP may be required to ensure compliance with missed approach routing and altitude.
