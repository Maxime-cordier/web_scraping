An ATCO might expect the following: Larger margins of adherence to cleared flight level;. Non standard phraseology used by the flight crew to describe the problem, e.g. we lost green (yellow, blue) hydraulics, or we lost 1 (2, standby) hydraulics etc., depending on the aircraft manufacturers' labeling system;. Sudden descent or climb;. Wider radius of turns with smaller rate of turn;. High approach speed;. Lack of autopilot (effect on CAT-landings);. Partial control over different control surfaces;. Reduced braking capability upon landing;. Runway excursion/blockage;. Post-landing fire, airframe damage..
