Where appropriate, the Enhance Vision information can be eliminated from the HUD screen and/or some of the enhanced information symbology (as selected by the manufacturer) can be turned off to reduce the amount of information presented on the HUD combiner. This feature can be used effectively during departure and arrival phases of flight to remove extraneous information thus allowing the pilot to more fully concentrate on the critical flight parameters.
