Caution - Whilst standby airspeed indicators and altimeters provide vital information in the event of failures to digital air data systems, they will not provide reliable information if the fault is within the pitot static system to which they are connected. In the event of a power failure, the internal vibrator in the standby altimeter may cease to function and the instrument may be subject to lag in the descent. It should, therefore, be tapped regularly to ensure an accurate reading.
