In all cases comply with the manufacturer's limitations and recommendations as published in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and in the Operations Manual as replicated in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) or the equivalent ECAM or EICAS displays.. WARNING - the misidentification or mishandling of a fuel leak can potentially lead to depletion of all fuel on board the aircraft. Use the QRH or other appropriate checklist to carefully identify and isolate the leaking component.. Where possible, maintain the aircraft wing to wing fuel balance within limits by referring to the QRH or other appropriate checklist. Fuel pump circuit breakers should NOT be reset in flight.. In light aircraft, use carburettor heat as appropriate. In larger aircraft at high altitude, if the fuel temperature approaches its freezing point, pilots can descend to warmer air, increase the aircraft speed to increase the Total Air Temperature or transfer fuel to a tank containing warmer fuel..
