As per the information presented above, in non-pressurised aircraft, the oxygen system is primarily intended to provide supplemental oxygen when required by altitude and time of exposure. It can also be used, when required, for protection in the event of smoke or fumes. As decompression is not an issue in a non-pressurised aircraft, time of useful consciousness concerns are much less significant and quick donning masks are generally not installed. Conversely, the primary purpose of oxygen systems installed in a pressurised aircraft is for emergency use in the event of a decompression. Flight deck oxygen equipment will also be used for fume, smoke and fire events and, dependant upon specifics of the equipment and the state of registry, for supplemental oxygen during certain normal flight profiles. As an example, if quick donning masks are not available, one pilot will be required to wear a mask during flight at altitudes above 25,000'. Above 41,000', the regulations of most states require that one pilot wear an oxygen mask at all times, even when quick donning masks are fitted. This is due to the very limited time of useful consciousness and the associated risk of incapacitation. Other oxygen sources carried on pressurised commercial aircraft include supplemental oxygen tank and masks units for medical use and oxygen generator equipped smoke hoods for crew use in the event that it is necessary to fight an on board fire. Depending upon individual passenger medical needs, supplemental oxygen tanks for planned use during the flight may also be carried. Arrangements for these tanks need to be made in advance with the carrier by the passenger concerned.
