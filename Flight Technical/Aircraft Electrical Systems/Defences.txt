Multiple primary generators and, where applicable, secondary (APU) or tertiary (RAT) generator installation. Multiple layers of redundancy greatly reduce the potential for loss of all electrical generation capability.. Components connected to the bus have individual circuit protection which, in the event of a component failure protect the bus from overload and thus protect the remaining components. A bus failure is more typically the result of a failure of the power source supplying the bus and not the failure of the bus itself. As an example, the failure of a TRU could result in the loss of the DC bus that it powers. Depending upon the system design, provisions for an alternate power source may allow the bus to be restored.. Circuit breakers (CB) exist to protect the system from overload in the event of a component failure and to prevent a potential fire from developing in the component itself by interrupting the electrical supply. In the event a circuit breaker "pops" in flight, the crew should comply with manufacturer and company policy when deciding whether or not the CB should be reset. Should a reset CB pop a second time, further reset should NOT be attempted. Note that some CB's such as those associated with fuel pumps should never be reset in flight.. In the event of smoke, fumes or fire from a suspected electrical source, QRH procedures should be applied immediately while concurrently initiating an immediate diversion. If the faulty component cannot be readily identified, the electrical isolation procedure should be followed. Smoke and fume elimination procedures may become a necessity. Land ASAP..
