An electrical system is an integral and essential component of all but the most simplistic of aircraft designs. The electrical system capacity and complexity varies tremendously between a light, piston-powered, single-engine general aviation aircraft and a modern, multi-engine commercial jet aircraft. However, the electrical system for aircraft at both ends of the complexity spectrum share many of the same basic components. All aircraft electrical systems have components with the ability to generate electricity. Depending upon the aircraft, generators or alternators are used to produce electricity. These are usually engine driven but may also be powered by an APU, a hydraulic motor or a Ram Air Turbine (RAT). Generator output is normally 115-120V/400HZ AC, 28V DC or 14V DC. Power from the generator may be used without modification or it may be routed through transformers, rectifiers or inverters to change the voltage or type of current. The generator output will normally be directed to one or more distribution Bus. Individual components are powered from the bus with circuit protection in the form of a Circuit Breaker or fuse incorporated into the wiring. The generator output is also used to charge the aircraft battery(s). Batteries are usually either of the lead-acid or NICAD types but lithium batteries are becoming more and more common. They are used for both aircraft startup and as an emergency source of power in the event of a generation or distribution system failure.
