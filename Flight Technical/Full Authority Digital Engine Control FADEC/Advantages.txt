Better fuel efficiency. Automatic engine protection against out-of-tolerance operations. Safer as the multiple channel FADEC computer provides redundancy in case of failure. Care-free engine handling, with guaranteed thrust settings. Ability to use single engine type for wide thrust requirements by just reprogramming the FADECs. Provides semi-automatic engine starting. Better systems integration with engine and aircraft systems. Can provide engine long-term health monitoring and diagnostics. Number of external and internal parameters used in the control processes increases by one order of magnitude. Reduces the number of parameters to be monitored by flight crews. Due to the high number of parameters monitored, the FADEC makes possible "Fault Tolerant Systems" (where a system can operate within required reliability and safety limitation with certain fault configurations). Saves weight.
