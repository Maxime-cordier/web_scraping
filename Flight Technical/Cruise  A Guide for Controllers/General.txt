During cruise the flight crew will generally provide a monitoring function, but will also manage ATC instructions and do any necessary paperwork. Constant weather updates will be obtained and occasionally the aircraft will be deviated around weather cells following negotiation with ATC. The crew will also use this time to prepare for the return leg (if there is one) and will discuss fuel needs, weather, suitable diversion aerodromes, NOTAMS and any other relevant information. Towards the latter stages of the cruise the PF will prepare for the approach which involves setting up the flight deck and briefing the PM on the approach and what the actions will be if they must perform a missed approach.
