In the event of a situation requiring the aircrew’s use of supplemental oxygen (e.g. a depressurisation event causing an increase in the cabin altitude to a level requiring supplemental oxygen), the aircrew will be required to don their oxygen masks. The masks are normally of the “quick donning” type that enable the aircrew to don them with one hand and in less than five seconds. Oxygen quantity, mask and microphone functionality are normally checked by the flight crew during the aircraft preflight checks. The masks and regulators should also be inspected and tested by maintenance personnel at predetermined intervals. Aircrew oxygen masks may be full face masks covering the entire face or a mask that covers just the mouth and nose. The flow of oxygen provided through the mask may be diluter demand (where the oxygen is mixed with ambient air), 100% oxygen, or delivered under positive pressure. The type of flow may be selectable by the crew or automatically selected by the aircraft’s oxygen system. Positive pressure is normally used for a smoke or fume event. Communications considerations: Even though aircrew oxygen masks are equipped with microphones, the quality of communications may be degraded, particularly if positive pressure oxygen is provided. This may affect communications both internal with other crewmembers and cabin personnel within the aircraft, and externally with other aircraft and air traffic control. Under these circumstances, it is recommended that crew disable the "hot microphone" feature.
