If required by regulation for the type and environment of operations, oxygen masks must be available for the aircrew to provide them with a source of breathable air. The masks are used in the event of a depressurisation event that raises the cabin altitude above an acceptable level, as determined by national regulations, or for a smoke or fumes event. The use of the mask will be determined by organisational policy and national regulations.
