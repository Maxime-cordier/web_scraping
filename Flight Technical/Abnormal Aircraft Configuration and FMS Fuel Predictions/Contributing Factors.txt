In the cited scenario, although the crew recognized that the fuel was being consumed faster than the FMS predicted and elected to change their diversion, they did not fully comprehend the urgency of their situation. The FMS fuel prediction for destination was falling because the Fuel On Board input to the FMS was being reduced more rapidly than the FMS programming would have predicted and not because the FMS was considering the gear down configuration. At any point in time, the FMS prediction would be based on the fuel burn from current position to destination for the “normal” configuration for the flight phase and not for the gear down configuration that the aircraft was in. In other words, when the second diversion decision was made, the FMS indicated that there was sufficient fuel on board to make the airfield when, in fact, there was not.
