The ultimate solution to this problem would be for manufacturers to include the configuration of the aircraft as an input to the FMS and to program the FMS to recognise the abnormal configuration and adjust the fuel predictions accordingly. A more simplistic solution might be to allow the crew to selectively input the performance penalty into the FMS based on an ECAM/EICAS/QRH procedure. As an example, the fuel burn for a jammed flap configuration might be 1.8 times the normal rate. Providing the FMS capability to allow this factor to be inserted would enable the FMS to make realistic predictions. Until a more robust solution is available, crews must be aware that under circumstances of Abnormal Aircraft Configuration, the FMS fuel predictions are no longer reliable and that they must use the manufacturerâ€™s performance penalties and the actual fuel flow to determine the aircraft range and endurance.
