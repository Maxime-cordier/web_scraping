The fuel prediction logic of the FMS is predicated on the aircraft being in what is considered to be the “normal” configuration for the phase of flight. As an example, the “normal “configuration for the landing gear would be UP from shortly after takeoff until about five miles from touchdown. As there is no direct input from the landing gear to the FMS, the FMS fuel predictions are based on the assumption that the “normal” gear profile has been followed. From this, it is apparent that the fuel predictions will no longer be valid during a gear down ferry or in the event that the gear fails to retract on selection. The same is true for high lift devices such as the flaps or slats. In many aircraft types, the FMS will no longer show fuel predictions in the event of an engine failure. However, in the case of an Abnormal Aircraft Configuration, the fuel predictions will continue to be available, are likely to be inaccurate and may lead the crew to an inappropriate decision.
