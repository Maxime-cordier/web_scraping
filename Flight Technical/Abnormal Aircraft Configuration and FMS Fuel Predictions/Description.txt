The Flight Management System (FMS), fitted in most modern commercial aircraft, has a variety of functions and provides a wealth of useful information. Assuming that the FMS database is current and correct for the aircraft/engine combination, that aircraft specific performance data has been entered and that realistic routing, altitude and wind data has been programmed into the FMS by the crew, the fuel prediction information provided can be used reliably to compare or predict fuel on board versus flight plan fuel for any point on the route of flight. However, under circumstances of Abnormal Aircraft Configuration, the fuel predictions are no longer accurate. Failure to realize this situation has lead crews to make false assumptions about their range and endurance and has been a contributory cause factor in several accidents and incidents.
