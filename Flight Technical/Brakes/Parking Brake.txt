The parking brake is usually applied by hand lever selection. Hydraulic accumulators are generally required if hydraulic pressure is to remain sufficient to hold parking brake settings for long periods once engines have been shut down and the primary source of hydraulic pressure is no longer available. On some types, the parking brake pressure will bleed off over time and the brakes will eventually release. All aircraft should be chocked once parked to prevent unplanned movement.
