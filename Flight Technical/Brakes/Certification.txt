It is a certification requirement that the braking system of an aircraft has the ability to stop an aircraft at maximum certified takeoff weight with the reject initiated at decision speed. The certification process must be done with all brakes worn to near their service limit (nominally 10% remaining life) and the brake and wheel heat sink must be robust enough that no intervention in terms of fire fighting or artificial cooling is required for 5 minutes after the aircraft has been stopped. The use of ground spoilers and maximum anti-skid braking is used during the certification test; however, reverse thrust on the engines or propellers is not allowed.
