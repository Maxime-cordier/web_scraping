Early aircraft had a single braking system with no backup or redundancy. This was seen as impractical by the operators and unacceptable by the regulating authorities so manufacturers were soon incorporating more robust braking systems into their designs. Some of the earlier solutions simply addressed the loss of the primary hydraulic pump and incorporated hand pumps or electrically driven hydraulic pumps to provide an alternate source of hydraulic pressure. These solutions did not address failures due to loss of fluid and were deemed inadequate. To overcome this, some manufacturers such as Convair incorporated a compressed air system into their designs for emergency braking. While it achieved the requirement of providing an independent means of activating the brakes, it was limited in that it did not allow for differential braking and in that the tank contained a finite amount of compressed air. Braking redundancy in most large passenger aircraft today is achieved by multiple, independent hydraulic systems backed up by accumulators. These systems allow for several layers of failure without resulting in total loss of braking capability. Brake assembly on a 737NG main landing gear
