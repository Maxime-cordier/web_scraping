Preventing cross connected systems is a challenge in aviation maintenance. When two systems or system components that are not designed to be connected are connected, the risk of an adverse occurrence is increased. The most effective means to reduce the risk of a cross connection is to have and use accurate and clear information on system connections in maintenance manuals and to insure strict adherence to these procedures by maintenance personnel. There are several other interventions that can be used to eliminate, or at least minimise the possibility of a system cross connection.
