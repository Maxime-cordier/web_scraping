Significant and sustained research and development of biofuels suitable for aviation use is relatively new. Driven by the need to find an alternative to finite fossil fuel reserves and the requirement to improve environmental performance, lessen the aviation carbon footprint and reduce operating costs, industry, operators and regulators are turning their attention to biofuel solutions. The current primary focus is on a sustainable "drop-in" biofuel suitable for use in turbine engines. A "drop-in" fuel is one that can be blended with fossil based fuel and used without requiring any changes to engines, airframes or fuel distribution systems. It must also have an energy density that matches or exceeds that of petroleum derived jet fuel and be usable at the temperature extremes of the operational envelope. To be considered sustainable, the biofuel should come from renewable sources that do not displace food crops or compete with food crops for land use or water. Ideally, they will also have a carbon neutral lifecycle (growth/production/use) and it is also desirable that growth and production of the biomass stocks create a locally positive socioeconomic impact. Some of the oil bearing plants meeting these critera include: The aviation biofuels produced from these and other plants are referred to as synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) or as hydroprocessed fatty acid esters and free fatty acids (HEFA) fuels. The international specification for the chemical composition of HEFA fuel is more strict than for conventional jet fuel, greatly reducing the likelihood of potential contamination caused by the biofuel. In 2011, the international aviation and fuel communities approved the blending of petroleum and bio-based fuels for use in commercial aviation.
