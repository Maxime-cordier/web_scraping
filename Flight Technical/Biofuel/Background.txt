The energy of a biofuel is derived from biological carbon fixation, which is the conversion of carbon dioxide to organic compounds by living organisms. The most common mechanism for carbon fixation is photosynthesis in plants. For use in an engine, the energy stored by carbon fixation must be extacted from the biomass (biological material from living, or recently living organisms) by various processes to produce biofuel. As examples: Bioethanol - an alcohol produced by the fermentation of the carbohydrates found in crops such as corn. Non-food sources, such as grasses, are being developed for ethanol production. Biodiesel - made from vegetable oils and animal fats using a chemical process known as transesterification. Methane - a biogas produced by anaerobic digestion, the breakdown of biodegradable material by micro-organsims, from animal manure, diverted landfill waste or from plant material.. Biofuels, if produced in sustainable ways, can contribute less to climate change than their fossil fuel conterparts. This is because, unlike fossil fuels, biofuels have the potential to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the biomass growth portion of their production and utilisation cycle.
