The energy of a biofuel is derived from biological carbon fixation, which is the conversion of carbon dioxide to organic compounds by living organisms. The most common mechanism for carbon fixation is photosynthesis in plants. For use in an engine, the energy stored by carbon fixation must be extacted from the biomass (biological material from living, or recently living organisms) by various processes to produce biofuel. As examples: Biofuels, if produced in sustainable ways, can contribute less to climate change than their fossil fuel conterparts. This is because, unlike fossil fuels, biofuels have the potential to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the biomass growth portion of their production and utilisation cycle.
