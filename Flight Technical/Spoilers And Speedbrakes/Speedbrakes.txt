Speedbrakes are high drag devices that are fitted to almost all high performance military aircraft as well as to some commercial aircraft types. In most cases, speedbrakes are fuselage mounted panels which, when selected by the pilot, extend into the airstream to produce drag. Dependant upon the aircraft type, the speed brake(s) may consist of a single panel or symetrically mounted pairs of panels. On the BA146, the speedbrakes are mounted on the tailcone. Speedbrakes may be used during the final approach to touchdown as well as after landing.
