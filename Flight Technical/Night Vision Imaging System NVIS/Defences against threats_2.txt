NVIS operations; normal and emergency procedures including all NVIS failure modes; maintenance of unaided night flying; crew coordination concept specific to NVIS operations; practice of the transition to and from NVG procedures; awareness of specific dangers relating to the operating environment; and risk analysis, mitigation and management. The flight crew checking syllabus must include night proficiency checks, including emergency procedures to be used on NVIS operations, and line checks with special emphasis on the followings: local area meteorology; NVIS flight planning; NVIS in-flight procedures; transitions to and from night vision goggles (NVG); normal NVIS procedures; and crew coordination specific to NVIS operations. The flight crew must complete a minimum of 50 hours flight time in the preceding 90 days, 10 hours of which must be on the aircraft type. Each pilot must complete the following in the preceding 90 days using NVGs: three night take-offs and landings (these must include a climb, level flight segment and descent of at least the equivalent of one circuit for each rotation); three specialist hovering tasks and three transition tasks (NVG to non-NVG back to NVG operations). Each pilot must also not be scheduled to fly more than five hours on NVGs during any single flight duty period. Generic control mechanisms for managing NVG operation hazards include not carrying passengers on training or operational flights, other than those specifically authorized for the task. Aircraft operators must also be approved by the competent authority for the conduct of NVG operations and comply with all applicable regulatory requirements . The operator must ensure that, as part of its risk analysis and management process, risks associated with the NVIS environment are minimised by specifying in the operations manual: selection, composition and training of crews; levels of equipment and dispatch criteria; and operating procedures and minima, such that normal and likely abnormal operations are described and adequately mitigated.
