Additional contributory factors associated with loss of hazard control during NVG operations include fatigue, over-confidence and complacency. Physiological limitations that are prevalent during the hours of darkness along with the limitations associated with NVGs, may have a significant impact on NVIS operations. Some of these limitations are the effects of fatigue (both acute and chronic), stress, eyestrain, working outside the pilotâ€™s normal circadian rhythm envelope, increased helmet weight, aggressive scanning techniques associated with NVIS, and various human factors engineering concerns that may have a direct influence on how the pilot works in the aircraft while wearing NVGs. These limitations may be mitigated through proper training and recognition, experience, adaptation, rest, risk management, and proper crew rest/duty cycles. Compared to other types of flight operations, there may be an increased tendency by the pilot to over-estimate the capabilities of the NVIS. Pilots must understand the importance of avoiding complacency during NVG flights. Similar to other specialised flight operations, complacency may lead to an acceptance of situations that would normally not be permitted. Attention span and vigilance are reduced, important elements in a task series are overlooked, and scanning patterns, which are essential for situational awareness, break down (usually due to fixation on a single instrument, object or task). Critical but routine tasks are often skipped. Some light leaks are bad enough to that the NVG image is washed out but some light leakage may cause less obvious degradation of the image. Subtle degredation such as minimal glare or blooming in the NVG image can mask terrain features or obstacles that would otherwise be visible in the NVG image. Awareness, training and standard operating procedures concerning pre-flight checks of NVG lighting compatibility and maintenance procedures when a leak is discovered, will help to mitigate the threat.
