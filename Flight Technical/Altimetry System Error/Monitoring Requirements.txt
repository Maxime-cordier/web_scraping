The extent of the issues associated with Altimetry System Error only became apparent due to the monitoring programs initiated for the implementation of RVSM in the North Atlantic and Western Europe. ICAO quickly responded to the initial findings presented to its Safety and Airspace Separation Panel (SASP) by issuing an amendment to Annex 11 requiring all regions where RVSM was implemented to include a permanent monitoring program and to establish a Regional Monitoring Agency. In 2005/06, additional examples of long term ASE instability were provided to the SASP from the monitoring programs in the North Atlantic and Western Europe. This resulted in an amendment to ICAO Annex 6 (2010) requiring all operators of RVSM approved aircraft to participate in long term regional monitoring programs. The amendment to Annex 6 requires all operators of RVSM approved aircraft to submit a minimum of 2 aircraft, of each type operated, to be height monitored at least once every 2 years or 1000 flying hours, whichever the greater. The Regional Monitoring Agency Coordination Group has developed a recommended Minimum Monitoring Requirements table which includes a variable monitoring target which is dependent on performance and sample size. However, it is for each Regional Planning Group to determine whether this MMR, (or any alternative MMR) should be adopted as a regional requirement. The lowest level of monitoring required by the MMR equates to the Annex 6 requirements and is reserved for aircraft types that have a large number of compliant monitoring results which are stable over time, from a representative sample size. For aircraft types that do not satisfy one or more of these criteria, there is a higher monitoring requirement of 60% of an operatorâ€™s fleet. For aircraft types with no monitoring history, or that do not satisfy generic aircraft performance requirements, it is possible for the RMA to allocate a 100% monitoring requirement.
