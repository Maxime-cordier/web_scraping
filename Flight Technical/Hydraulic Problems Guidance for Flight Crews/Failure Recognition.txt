Hydraulic failures can be subtle (as would be the case with a slow fluid leak) or immediate (as the result of a pump failure, an actuator failure or the rupture of a hydraulic line). Depending upon the sophistication level of the aircraft warning systems in question, the failure could be presented to the crew by means of an EICAS or ECAM message, a Master Caution or Master Warning light, an annunciator panel fail light, a system warning light or by means of a pressure or quantity gauge indication. An aural warning may also be associated with the failure. Pilots should acknowledge the failure annunciation by cancelling any aural warnings and, where possible, confirm the failure in accordance with the aircraft operator's Standard Operating Procedures and with the manufacturer's guidance prior to carrying out the immediate corrective actions.
