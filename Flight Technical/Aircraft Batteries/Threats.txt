There are a number of potential threats that can be associated with aircraft batteries, their distribution networks and their charging and monitoring systems. These threats include: Battery Leakage. Overfilling a wet cell battery can cause leakage. Likewise, damage to the battery case caused by mishandling, overcharging or freezing can result in leakage.. Battery Internal Failure or Short Circuit. Manufacturing defects or inappropriate handling can result in internal failures.. Battery Overcharging. Batteries can be overcharged due to faulty charging equipment or inappropriate maintenance practices.. Excessive Battery Charging Rate. Some battery types are vulnerable to high rates of charge.. Excessive Battery Discharge Rate. Some battery types are vulnerable to high rates of discharge.. Battery Bus Fault or Fire. A Battery Bus Bar is "hot" - it cannot be electrically isolated from the source battery without physically removing the battery..
