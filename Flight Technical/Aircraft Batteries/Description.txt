With the exception of the most rudimentary of aircraft types, virtually all aeroplanes incorporate an electrical system. In the vast majority of cases, the primary electrical system incorporates one or more batteries. Batteries are used during preflight to power up the electrical system and to start the Auxiliary Power Unit and/or the engines. Once started, the APU or engine(s) drive generators which then power the electrical circuits and recharge the batteries. In the event of the failure or required isolation of all generators as part of a Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) procedure where they are the source of all normal electrical power when operating, battery power is available as a substitute source for essential use. Some electrically powered fixed equipment such as the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), the CVR, the FDR, will have their own dedicated batteries. Portable equipment routinely carried on board aircraft such as Torches, Megaphones and Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) are also battery powered. In both cases, since batteries are an energy source, their failure due to damage, defect, malfunction or misuse represents a potential risk of hazardous fumes, smoke or fire.
