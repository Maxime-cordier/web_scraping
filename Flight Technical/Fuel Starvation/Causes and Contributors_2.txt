relation to pilot experience, research has found no relationship between the total hours flown and involvement in fuel-related occurrences. A relationship has been found, however, between hours on the specific aircraft type and involvement in fuel related occurrences. That is, pilots with fewer hours on type tended to be involved in a greater number of fuel-related occurrences. Regular Public Transport, commuter and training operations were found to have experienced fewer occurrences than were expected given the hours flown in each category. On the other hand, private/business/general aviation operations were found to have been responsible for a disproportionately large number of fuel-related occurrences.. Fatigue has been found to increase human error rates and may be a contributing factor to the high rate of fuel exhaustion and fuel starvation accidents within the agricultural category where long working hours are the norm. Alternatively, the high mental workload experienced by pilots in agricultural operations may narrow their attention to tasks such as avoiding terrain and other obstacles as well as continually recalculating load requirements, resulting in reduced monitoring of the aircraftâ€™s fuel system. Still, caution must be used when drawing any conclusions about the relative safety of any operations category..
