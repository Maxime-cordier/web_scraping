In an article entitled "Surface Coatings and Drag Reduction" published in Aero Magazine, Boeing examines the potential drag reduction of aftermarket coatings against the standard fit and finish of their products at the time of delivery. The article concludes that, against the new aircraft benchmark, there is little advantage to be gained by applying aftermarket coatings save for possible surface protection and potential reduction in the aircraft wash cycle frequency. The article asserts that the best methods of minimising drag include careful management of aircraft loading to ensure optimum centre of gravity and the proper maintenance of: Boeing concludes that "the most effective means of reducing drag is to maintain aerodynamically clean airplanes"[4].
