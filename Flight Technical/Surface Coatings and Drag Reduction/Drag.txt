In aerodynamics, drag refers to forces that oppose the relative motion of an object through the air. In an aircraft, drag is overcome by thrust. To provide thrust, aircraft engines burn fuel. If drag is reduced, the thrust required to overcome it will be proportionally reduced and the required fuel burn will decrease. During the design phase, aircraft manufacturers invest significant effort and expense in attempting to minimise the drag profile and improve the overall performance of their products. Component weights, aerodynamic shapes, engine efficiency, wing span, winglets and numerous other factors such as the addition of appropriate fairings or seals, and minimising the size and number of exposed components, are all considered during the design process. Many of the design phase decisions result in a corresponding drag component that would not be affected by the subsequent application of a surface coating. However, drag is also caused by skin friction. Drag from skin friction is created by the disruption of the airflow across aircraft surfaces. Skin friction will increase as a result of surface roughness due to surface or paint imperfections, the adhesion of dirt or dead insects to aircraft surfaces or the presence of contaminating fluids caused by leaks, spillage or deicing. In these cases, surface coatings may provide a degree of drag reduction.
