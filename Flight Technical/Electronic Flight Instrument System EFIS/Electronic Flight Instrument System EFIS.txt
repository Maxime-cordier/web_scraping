An Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) is a flight deck instrument display system in which the display technology used is electronic rather than electromechanical. Early EFIS systems portray information using cathode ray tube (CRT) technology. Later instrument displays are presented on multi-colour liquid-crystal display (LCD) screens, which replace some or all of the conventional flight instruments for both pilots. A typical EFIS system comprises a Primary Flight Display (PFD) (Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator (EADI)) and an Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI) (Navigation Display). In some designs the two displays are integrated into one.
