Barometric altimeter displays may be of two main types: The main types of conventional altimeter which have been used in aircraft are: The three-pointer altimeter and the counter drum-pointer altimeter are illustrated below. It has been found that the displays of three-pointer altimeters, drum-pointer altimeters and counter-pointer altimeters are capable of being mis-read and several accidents have been attributed to this cause. Accordingly, counter drum-pointer altimeters are the the only type currently approved for use in commercial aircraft. In modern aircraft, conventional instruments are used mostly as standby instruments. Modern aircraft are usually equipped with composite Electronic Flight Instrument System displays which combine the functions of several conventional instruments into one. Presentations vary according to the manufacturer's design philosophy. The illustration below shows a typical EFIS display in which the altitude is depicted on a vertical tape to the right of the attitude indicator. In the illustration, the altitude is 5100 ft. The altimeter pressure setting (29.92 in Hz) is depicted in green below the altitude tape.
