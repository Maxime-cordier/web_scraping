The system consists of: The device is usually mounted in the vertical fin of an airplane. The outer surface is flush with the fin's skin to ensure that there is no effect on the aircraft's aerodynamics. Deployment is triggered by significant structural deformation or an impact with water. In the event of an airborne deployment, the spring mechanism in the housing case pushes the recorder into the slipstream, where its shape acts as an aerofoil and ensures it is carried away from the aircraft.
