Communication with the cabin crew is required at certain stages of the flight as specified by SOPs. Such requirements are usually: • To confirm that the cabin is secure for take-off. • To confirm that the cabin is secure for landing. • To release the cabin crew to work after take-off. • To request entry into the cockpit. When communication is of a verbal nature this therefore means one of the pilots is removed from flight deck duties (with respect to monitoring the aircraft and monitoring the comms frequency) whilst communicating with the cabin crew (via the intercom). Some aircraft have systems that allow the required communication with the cabin crew to be accomplished in a non-verbal manner. This gives a more desirable method of operation as both pilots can therefore remain monitoring the aircraft and comms frequency. Such non-verbal communication is usually achieved via a cabin crew member pressing a button in the cabin which activates a message on the ECAM screen in the flight deck or activates a light or buzzer in the flight deck. The signal to release the cabin crew to work after take-off may be achieved by a pilot switching off the seat belt signs - this will automatically sound a chime in the cabin. The SOP may be to switch the seat belt signs off and on in quick succession so that the chime is sounded but the seat belt signs are immediately re-illuminated in order to keep the passengers in their seats.
