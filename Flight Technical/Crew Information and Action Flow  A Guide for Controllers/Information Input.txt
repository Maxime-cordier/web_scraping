Flight decks vary considerably, but generally use the same basic layout, and follow a set of common fundamental principles. Most systems-related controls, such as hydraulics, fuel, electrical, and pressurisation, are usually located on the overhead panel. Radios tend to be located on the panel between the pilots known as the pedestal. Automatic flight controls are usually placed in direct view of the pilots on the panel directly below the windshield, known as the glare shield. The onboard instrumentation can be categorised as flight instruments, navigation instruments and systems instruments. Flight and navigation instruments are usually directly in front of each pilot, and the engine displays tend to be located in the middle of the centre panel. Civil transport aircraft use a side by side seating, primarily because it aids Crew Resource Management; the pilots are able to communicate face to face, and are able to see what the other pilot is doing, which enables them to cross-check each other. The Electronic Flight Information System, or Electronic Flight Instrument System, is used on almost all modern aircraft today. EFIS consists of a set of displays, controls and data processors and present the flight instruments, navigation instruments and systems instruments electronically. The displays vary but generally grouped into the Primary Flight Display, the Navigation Display and the Systems Display. Each pilot of a large transport aircraft will have their own Primary Flight Display and a Navigation Display, but the Systems Display may be shared.
