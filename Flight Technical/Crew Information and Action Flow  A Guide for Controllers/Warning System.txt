There is also a warning system that flags anything that exceeds a certain limit. The limits at which the warnings are activated may change depending on the phase of flight, aircraft configuration and so on. The warnings can be provided visually on the information displays, by an audible warning, such as a voice command, or by both visual and audible warnings. Warnings relating to the control of the aircraft are duplicated on both sets of information displays. Warnings relating to the engines would be shown on the engine display, often located in the middle of the main panel central to both pilots.
