Crew Resource Management (CRM) is a concept that originated in the late 70s that focuses on improving air safety by improving interpersonal communication, leadership, and decision making in the cockpit. It essentially introduces a concept for the flight deck crew to cooperate to reduce the chance of human error. Part of this concept is based on redundancy of the crew, in other words that both crew members should be competent and capable of carrying out all tasks onboard. This is for the following reasons: The final responsibility lies with the captain who is ultimately accountable for the safety of the flight. However, the role of the pilots usually changes on a leg by leg basis. One pilot will assume the Pilot Flying (PF) role, the other the Pilot Monitoring (PM) role. The PF essentially runs the flight and flies the aircraft. The PM monitors the flight, looks for traffic, and mentally flies the aircraft while watching everything the PF does. The PM is usually responsible for navigation and communication with ATC. The extended team consists of the cabin crew, but are not as closely connected due to job diversity and the separation from the flight deck by a locked door. Much of the communication with the cabin crew is via the intercom rather than face to face. The busiest time for pilots is during departure and arrival. The cabin crew become busy during cruise as this is when the cabin services take place.
