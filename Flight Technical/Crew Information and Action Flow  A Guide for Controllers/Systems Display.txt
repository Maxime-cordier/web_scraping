The Systems Display displays information about the aircraft's systems such as fuel, electrical and engines. Complex information is shown in a graphical format to increase situation awareness, and the system is designed to only show the information that the pilots need to know at any given point in time. As an example, in case of falling oil pressure the Systems Display may display an oil pressure indication, and may augment this further by showing the dial in red.
