The heart of the modern flight deck is the FMS which mainly controls the aircraftâ€™s navigation. It allows the pilots to input the whole flight plan and also allows the pilots to modify it in flight. The flight plan is generally determined on the ground, before departure either by the pilot for smaller aircraft or a professional dispatcher for airliners. It is entered into the Flight Management System either by typing it in or selecting it from a saved library. During pre-flight other information relevant to managing the flight is entered. This can include performance information such as gross weight, fuel weight and centre of gravity. It will include altitudes including the initial cruise altitude. For aircraft that do not have a GPS, the initial position is also required. The FMS uses various sensors to determine the aircraft's position, and can determine the optimum speed and level for the given conditions. Much of the data that is either computed by the Flight Management System or directly inputted by the crew is then shown on the Primary Flight Displays and the Navigation Displays. As an example, the programmed route of flight is shown on the Navigation Display as a magenta line, and the speeds and modes of operations are shown on the Primary Flight Display.
