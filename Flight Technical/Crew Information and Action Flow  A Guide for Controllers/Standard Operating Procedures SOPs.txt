SOPs are a statement of the actions that the flight crew are to take and the methods to be used when operating the aircraft. The SOPs are specified in the operator’s ‘Operations Manual’ and must therefore, by law, be adhered to. The intention and philosophy of SOPs are that they allow all flight crew members to work together without confusion by removing any personal habits (as exact actions are clearly stated) and removing any language barriers and colloquialisms (as standard verbal calls are clearly stated). SOPs are therefore a very powerful tool as, by adhering to them, every verbal call is understood and every action can be anticipated and easily recognised as being a correct or incorrect action for the current situation. This therefore provides not only an efficient method of operating but also a safe one. As such, it is useful for controllers to note that virtually every flight crew action and verbal call from the pre-flight cockpit set up until the top of climb, and from the arrival briefing until engine shut down after landing, will be exactly as specified in the SOPs. During the cruise phase of flight SOPs will still exist, however, as flight crew members are generally less busy during the cruise, general social conversations and personal behaviour become more the norm in between the SOP duties. The required SOP verbal calls may be of interest to controllers and a list of these is given in the Operations Manual. It is a requirement to carry the Operations Manual onboard the aircraft and so controllers maybe able to ask the flight crew to see the relevant chapter(s) during fam flights. It should be noted that SOPs specify both the initial call-out and also the response (where a response is required). The term ‘verbal call’ therefore refers both to call-outs and responses. Two examples of the exactness of SOPs are:
