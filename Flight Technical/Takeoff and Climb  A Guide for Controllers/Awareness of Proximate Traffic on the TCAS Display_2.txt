flight, particularly with reference to climb and descent, in order to view proximate traffic effectively. Note also that transponding traffic that is not reporting any altitude information can also be shown on the TCAS display, typically its symbol being a white diamond. Although pilots know that aircraft are required to contact ATC and obtain a clearance before entry into controlled airspace, it could be assumed that any such ‘white diamonds’ are likely to be beneath the base of controlled airspace and therefore should not constitute a collision hazard. However, if any non altitude-reporting aircraft infringes the ‘traffic advisory’ time boundary determined by TCAS, the system will generate a TA because it considers such targets as being ‘co-altitude’. The white diamond then changes to a yellow circle. In such circumstances TAs can be a cause of apprehension for pilots of TCAS-equipped aircraft if the non altitude-reporting aircraft continues to approach and poor visibility prevents them from sighting it visually. There can then be a strong temptation to call ATC for confirmation that there is adequate vertical separation. (Normally, TA and RA symbols display relative vertical height intervals from the TCAS-equipped aircraft.)
