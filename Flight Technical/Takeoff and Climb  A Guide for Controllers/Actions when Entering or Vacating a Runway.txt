When entering or vacating a runway the flight crew will be required to perform certain actions, most or all of which will be due to Standard Operating Procedures (Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)). This will mean that one or both pilots become ‘heads down’ in the cockpit whilst performing such actions. Although as stated previously there is now a greater emphasis on the avoidance of becoming ‘heads down’ and of appropriately monitoring the ground movement of the aircraft; in certain situations this cannot be avoided as the actions must be accomplished. It is therefore at the judgment of the flight crew how best to manage these tasks and the maintenance of their situational awareness in such circumstances. During fam flights it is useful for controllers to observe such actions with regards to being ’heads down’ particularly in the case of the ‘before take-off’ checklist and the ‘after landing scan’ as these are often lengthy processes. If possible the ‘before take-off’ checklist will be constructed such that it can be completed before the aircraft enters the runway. Ideally it will be accomplished and completed either whilst on a straight portion of the taxiway or whilst stationary at the holding point. This, however, may not be possible depending on the specific aircraft type or operator in question, and may require part of or the entire ‘before take-off’ checklist to be completed only when a clearance to enter the runway is received.
