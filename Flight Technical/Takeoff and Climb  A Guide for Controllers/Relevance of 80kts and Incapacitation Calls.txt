When lined up on the runway and cleared for take-off, the PF will start to advance the thrust levers. On aircraft that are powered by fan engines – especially aeroplanes like the AIRBUS A-300/A330 Family where the engines are relatively large – inertia in the big fans at the front may mean that both or all engines do not always ‘spool up’ at the same rate. Until this has happened, the pilot should not advance the throttles any further as to do so could set up an asymmetry that he/she might find difficult to control through nose-wheel steering alone. Once the engines have all ‘spooled up’ it is safe to advance the thrust levers together to the position that will enable the engines to deliver the amount of thrust required for take-off. It is for ‘spool up’ reasons that tower controllers may sometimes observe a hesitation – typically 6 to 10 seconds - after the aeroplane begins to roll forward before its acceleration along the runway appears ‘normal’, and why pilots may not always seem to respond quickly to requests to ‘expedite departure’. The required thrust should be attained before the aeroplane’s indicated air speed passes 80kts. In order to reduce the likelihood of a rejected take-off resulting in an over-run or other undesirable outcome, it is often stated in the SOPs that once above a specified speed during the take-off roll the take-off should only be rejected for specified occurrences. The specified speed is typically 80 knots. Below this speed the take-off may be rejected for any reason. Above the specified speed it is typical for the SOPs to state that the take-off should only be rejected for an engine failure, any type of fire or an unsafe condition that would render the aircraft unable to fly. The call at 80 knots is also used to check that the pilots have not become incapacitated during the take-off roll. If the PM does not make the call, or if the PF does not respond, it could be due to incapacitation and the take-off should be aborted.
