In the light of the lost MH370 flight, various organizations have been working on ways to provide better (more reliable and worldwide covered) tracking of flights. This article describes the use of space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) for tracking aircraft over areas with sub-optimal coverage of surveillance systems (e.g. over oceanic and remote areas). At present, space-based ADS-B is considered to be the most suitable solution for a global surveillance technology.
