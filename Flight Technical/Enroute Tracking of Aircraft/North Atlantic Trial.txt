In January 2019, the last of 75 low earth orbit (LEO) satellites â€“ 66 operational and nine orbiting spares -- carrying Aireon ADS-B payloads were successfully deployed. The LEO satellites, which will orbit approximately 485 miles above the earth. The ADS-B payloads enable them to receive ADS-B information broadcast from ADS-B-equipped aircraft and transfer the aircraft data from satellite to satellite down to a ground-based processing and distribution system. In April 2019, ANSPs NAV Canada and NATS began a trial of the Aireon system over the North Atlantic started. The system provides air traffic controllers real-time data on aircraft position. Use of the system will allow controllers to trial the reduction of aircraft in-trail separation distance, among other benefits. In addition, the Airports Authority of India in July signed an agreement to deploy the air traffic surveillance technology in Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata's oceanic airspaces.
