Most modern aircraft are fitted with an Air Data Computer (ADC). This computer uses inputs from the pitot-static system and from temperature sensors to determine Indicated Airspeed, Mach Number, True Airspeed, Altitude, Vertical Speed, Outside Air Temperature (OAT) and Total Air Temperature (TAT). These data are fed to aircraft systems, especially the Electronic Flight Instrument System.
