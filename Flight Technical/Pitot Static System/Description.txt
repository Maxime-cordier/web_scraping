An aircraft pitot-static system comprises a number of sensors which detect the ambient air pressure affected (pitot pressure) and unaffected (static pressure) by the forward motion of the aircraft. These pressures are used on their own or in combination with each other to provide indications of various flight parameters. These include: Pitot and static pressure are also used in other equipment, such as the Autopilot and the Cabin Altimeter.
