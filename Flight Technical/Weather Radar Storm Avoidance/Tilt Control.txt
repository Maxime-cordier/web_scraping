Climb: Weather radars can often have 2 attitude references; slaved to the aircraft attitude or external horizon. Make sure that your tilt setting takes account of which reference source you are using. With the radar slaved to the external horizon and a 0 deg angle set on the tilt control, you will not be viewing the weather ahead of you in a 5 deg climb but observing the weather below that you will be climbing over. Gross Error Check: You can validate the alignment of the weather radar by carrying out a gross check using the 1-in-60 rule; as an example, at around 30000ft with the radar tilt set to 10deg down, the ground returns should be around the 30 nm range. Cruise: Weather radars usually have a beam width of around 2.5 deg. Setting the tilt control to around 1deg down (relative to the external horizon) will allow you to observe weather ahead and slightly below the aircraft. If your radar allows multiple elevation scans, then it is prudent to select a pattern that spends some time looking lower than the aircraft to give yourself the best chance of identifying developing weather systems, thus allowing you to take early avoiding action. Descent: As for the climb, ensure that you have got the tilt set to allow for the system attitude reference that is enabled. Another issue with descents is the potential for confusion with ground returns. Whilst modern radar systems often have algorithms designed to screen out ground clutter, your system may not. As in the cruise you can use the beam width to help; consider setting the tilt control to 1 deg up in order to minimise ground clutter returns.
