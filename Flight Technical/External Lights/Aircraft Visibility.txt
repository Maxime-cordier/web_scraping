The following lighting systems are intended to reduce the potential of collision, by making the aircraft more visible to other aircraft while in flight and to ground traffic while manoeuvering on an aerodrome: Navigation Lights - Navigation lights consist of a red light on the left/port wing tip, a green light on the right/starboard wing tip and a white light on the aircraft tail. Dual systems are often installed to provide redundancy in the event of a bulb failure. In aircraft equiped with a beacon, the navigation lights will normally burn steadily whereas in aircraft without a beacon, the navigation lights will flash.. Beacon - The aircraft beacon lights are red in colour and either flash or rotate to provide a pulsating warning light. They are normally installed in pairs with one on the top of the fuselage and the other on the bottom. The beacon is normally turned on prior to engine start and turned off after engines have been shut down.. Strobe Lights - When installed, strobe lights are usually positioned near the trailing edge of the wing tips and may also be installed on the tail of the aircraft. Strobes are high intensity white lights which flash at a regular interval. They are normally turned on when entering an active runway for takeoff and turned off when leaving the runway after landing. In many cases, the strobe light switch will have an AUTO position which will result in activation and deactivation of the lights based on weight on wheels. Strobes can also be used to provide additional visibility when crossing an active runway during ground manoevering..
