flight deck. If there is a delay (slot time) the crew will tell ATC that they are ready, and hope for a better time. This can only be done if the aircraft is actually ready, meaning loaded with passengers and fuel, and all doors and hatches closed. Once the departure is confirmed by the departure clearance the briefing can begin which tends to be given by PF. The briefing will be an in depth description of the departure and what to do in case of an emergency. If there is an Emergency Turn Procedure it will be covered during the briefing.
