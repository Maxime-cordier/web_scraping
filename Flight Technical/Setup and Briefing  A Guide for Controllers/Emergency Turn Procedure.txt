The regulatory authorities specify the minimum climb gradients that must be achieved when flying instrument departures in order to ensure that a safe margin from terrain is maintained. For the case of an engine failure on take-off, the aircraft must still be able to achieve such gradients. However, if this cannot be achieved an alternative route must be specified in order to ensure that a safe margin from terrain is maintained. Such alternative routes are termed ‘Emergency Turn Procedures’. Should an engine failure occur on take-off or during the initial climb, the flight crew may therefore elect to fly the emergency turn procedure, and this may require a very different route to be flown compared to the cleared route e.g. the route may be different to the Standard Instrument Departure (SID). Individual operators are responsible for determining their own emergency turn procedures and gaining such an approval from the regulatory authorities. Emergency turn procedures are therefore operator specific. Note that this may mean that the same aircraft type has differing procedures with different operators. Emergency turn procedures are therefore available in the flight deck to enable flight crews to reference them appropriately. Controllers can therefore ask to view such details for their information during fam flights. How the crew handle late slot times.. How the crew cross-checks the performance data..
