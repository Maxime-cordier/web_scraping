Takeoff performance can be limited by any of the following: runway characteristics including Take Off Distance Available (TODA), Accelerate Stop Distance Available (ASDA), elevation, slope and the presence of contamination. atmospheric conditions including temperature, wind and pressure. aircraft limitations including maximum takeoff weight, maximum tire rotation speed, maximum allowable time at takeoff thrust and any performance decrements due to Minimum Equipment List (MEL) or Configuration Deviation List criteria. certification criteria for engine out climb performance. Under the regulations, the Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) can be limited by certification criteria that require a gross engine out climb gradient of 2.4%, 2.7% or 3.0% for two, three and four engine aircraft respectively. To ensure obstacle clearance while allowing for aircraft performance degradation and less than optimum pilot technique, the gross gradients are reduced by 0.8%, 0.9% and 1.0% respectively to calculate a net gradient. This net gradient is then published in the AFM performance data and, in actual operations, must ensure that the limiting obstacle in the departure path is cleared by a minimum of 35'. If there is an obstacle within the departure path that cannot be avoided and would not be cleared by 35', the planned takeoff weight must be reduced until minimum obstacle clearance can be achieved. Note that turns during the intial climb are limited to 15Â° of bank and that turning will result in a reduction in aircraft climb capability.
