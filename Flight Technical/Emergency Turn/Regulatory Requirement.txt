Takeoff and initial climb performance requirements following an engine failure are specified in National Regulations. These regulations require that the aircraft be capable of meeting a specified minimum climb gradient, the value of which is dependent upon the number of engines installed and the regulatory criteria under which the aircraft has been certified, until reaching 1500' AGL or the minimum enroute altitude.
