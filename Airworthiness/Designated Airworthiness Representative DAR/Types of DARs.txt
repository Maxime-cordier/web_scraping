There are two types of DARs: manufacturing (DAR-F) and maintenance (DAR-T). Manufacturing DARs perform many of the same functions as another category of designees known as designate manufacturing inspection representatives (DMIR) but work as individual consultants. Maintenance DARs must hold a mechanicâ€™s certificate with an airframe and powerplant (A&P) rating, OR a repairman certificate and be employed at a repair station certified under Part 145 of the federal regulations, or by an air carrier with an FAA-approved continuous airworthiness program.
