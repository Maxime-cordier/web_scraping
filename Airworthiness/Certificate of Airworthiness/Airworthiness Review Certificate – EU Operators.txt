To satisfy the requirement for this Airworthiness review, a full documented review of the aircraft records is carried out by CAMO, as described in EASA Part M.A.710 [EC, 2014]: a. Records of maintenance, modifications, LLPs, configuration, release to service, repairs, recording of hours and cycles, mass and balance etc. b. Airworthiness review staff of CAMO shall carry out a physical survey of the aircraft. c. Required markings / placards, compliance with flight manual and documentation; no evident defects; no inconsistencies between aircraft and records. An ARC may be extended up to 3 years, if the aircraft is maintained within a “controlled environment” i.e. an approved CAMO can issue the ARC and extend it twice. The extension must include a documented verification that the aircraft remains airworthy. A Controlled environment means that the aircraft is: An Uncontrolled Environment means that the continuing airworthiness of an aircraft is managed by an owner or operator in accordance with EASA Part M Subpart C [EC, 2014]. The aircraft must be maintained by an appropriately licensed engineer, except for “complex tasks” which can only be certified by a Subpart F or Part 145 approved organisation. Once every 12 months, the owner / operator must contract the services of a CAMO, who must conduct a full Airworthiness Review before making a recommendation to NAA for issue of an ARC. The NAA may also wish to survey the aircraft prior to issuing ARC.
