The regulators require that airlines provide appropriate information on their PED policy to passengers before flight. This information should include at least the following: which PEDs can be used/are not to be used throughout the flight especially during critical phases of flight and when taxiing;. if, when and where PEDs are to be stowed during critical phases of flight and taxiing; and. that all instructions of the crew in respect of PED use must be followed at all times, given that operational circumstances may require that additional temporary restrictions on their use may need to be imposed.. The regulatory guidance referenced earlier also advises that airlines should use recognisable and standard terminology in all announcements about PED use so as to preclude passenger confusion. It is anticipated that there will be some differences in the PED use policies adopted by airlines. It is therefore stressed that the information to passengers should correspond to the specifics of the policy adopted by the individual airline. For example see the British Airways Policy for on-board use of PED. It should be noted that whilst the latest regulatory guidance is believed to be sufficient to mitigate the potential threat to aircraft systems posed by electromagnetic radiation from PEDs, its effectiveness depends upon the cabin crew being able to ensure that passengers do not ignore instructions given, which is acknowledged to be potentially challenging. All electronic equipment which is installed in or accepted as an essential crew-use item on any aircraft, for example flight crew EFBs operated independently of the aircraft systems, must comply with appropriate airworthiness certification requirements. Since this is clearly impractical in the case of passengersâ€™ PEDs, the revised Regulatory position has effectively deemed such action unnecessary.
