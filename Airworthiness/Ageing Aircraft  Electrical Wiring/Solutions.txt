Improved inspection and diagnostic processes for EWIS in aging aircraft are being progressively mandated but the prospect of longer term progress lies in new technology. Live-wire testing of aircraft EWIS during flight is now possible and can detect intermittent faults that cannot be located during maintenance on the ground. Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter technology is being developed to provide additional safety measures when a fault occurs. Moving forward, nanoscale sensors embedded within emerging ‘smart’ wire systems will detect and correct faults in real time. In the longer run, fibre optics and wireless technologies will reduce the need for bulky wiring looms. While these and other techniques are being developed and tested, fleets must rely on diligent application of the array of currently available diagnostic technologies. In some instances, where wiring deterioration has been found in locations where the consequences could be instantly disastrous, such as in the FQIS systems inside fuel tanks, means of protecting against the consequences of ignition, such as nitrogen inerting, have been examined, although not yet implemented.
