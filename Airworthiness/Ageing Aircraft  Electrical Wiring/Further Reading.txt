In 2004, the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) published its findings on three serious incidents involving electrical wiring damage and took the exceptional opportunity to review all three incidents together in the context of industry developments and make generic rather than the conventional incident-specific safety recommendations. The two areas addressed were wiring damage and circuit breaker design. See AAIB Bulletin: Incidents resulting from damaged electrical wiring.
