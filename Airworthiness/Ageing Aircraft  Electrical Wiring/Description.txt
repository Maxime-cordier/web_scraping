Deterioration in an aircraft electrical wiring interconnection system (EWIS) is often difficult to identify and repair. The EWIS on many older aircraft still in service was often designed on the ‘fit and forget’ principle, but both age itself and inadvertent collateral damage during unrelated maintenance or routine inspections cause airworthiness problems. Both deterioration and damage are often associated with the difficult-to-detect condition of wiring within the bundles of wires routed together as in ‘looms’. These looms and aircraft wiring generally are often in locations which are difficult to access and, even where they are accessible, only the condition of the outer wires can be properly checked. A lot of effort has therefore been put into developing more effective inspection processes for wiring loom integrity in particular, but also into practical methods of confirming wiring circuit integrity generally. Attention has also been focused on good maintenance practice in respect of wiring looms which have in the past often been vulnerable to undetected damage inadvertently caused during base maintenance.
