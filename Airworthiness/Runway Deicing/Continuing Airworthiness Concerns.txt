Because the chemicals used to de-ice runways can pose an environmental hazard, there has been a move from urea and glycol-based de-icing products to alkali-metal-salt-based products such as Potassium Acetate and Potassium Formate. However, these alkali metal products have been associated with damage to carbon brakes through catalytic oxidation of the carbon which can lead to brake failure and corrosion of Cadmium plated airframe components. Impingement of frozen or semi-frozen deposits on carbon brake assemblies is more likely to lead to frozen brake units and progressively affect their function over time due to their greater porosity compared to the older steel brakes. In 2013, EASA issued a second revised version of a Safety Information Bulletin originally issued in 2008 Safety Information Bulletin No: 2008-19R2 and discussing these safety concerns. Another Safety Information Bulletin No: 2018-01 recommends operators of aerodromes, that regularly conduct de/anti-icing operations of the aircraft movement area(s), to publish information on the generic fluids and/or solid materials they are using, in a SNOWTAM, when it is issued, or to insert such information in the remarks column of part AD 2.7 of the AIP.
