forward and aft, severing the three latch assemblies that joined the inboard and outboard halves of the fan cowl, which caused large portions of both fan cowl halves to separate and depart the airplane.” According to NTSB, key structural integrity–relevant safety issues included these: “It is important that the interaction of the fan case, radial restraint fitting, and fan cowl during an FBO event be well understood to preclude a failure of the fan cowl structure on Boeing 737NG-series airplanes. … Boeing’s post-accident analyses found that the fan cowl structure is more sensitive and more susceptible to failure when a separated fan blade impacts the fan case near the six o’clock position because of the proximity of this fan blade impact location to the radial restraint fitting (at the bottom of the inboard fan cowl);” [and,]. There also is a need to “determine whether other airframe/engine combinations have any critical fan blade impact locations and how an impact at those locations could affect nacelle components.”.
