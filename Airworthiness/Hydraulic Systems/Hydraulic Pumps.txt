Several types of hydraulic pumps driven by a variety of power sources can be found in aviation applications. Pumps include: Gear Pumps. Gear pumps use meshing gears to pump fluid. Gear pumps are fixed displacement type pumps as they move a specific amount of fluid per rotation. Gear pumps may be used on low pressure systems (under 1500 psi) but are generally not suitable for high pressure applications. Fixed Displacement Piston Pumps. Piston pumps utilize a piston moving in a cylinder to pressurize a fluid. A fixed displacement pump moves a specific amount of fluid with each stroke.. Variable Displacement Piston Pumps. This is the most common type of pump on large aircraft. The variable displacement design allows the pump to compensate for changes in the system demand by increasing or decreasing the fluid output. This allows near constant system pressure to be maintained.. The motive power for these pumps can be generated by a wide variety of options inclusive of: Manual. In many light aircraft, a manual hydraulic pump provides pressure for wheel brakes or flap extension and retraction.. Engine Driven. Pumps are frequently mounted on the engine accessory gear box.. Electric. Both AC and DC motors are utilized to power hydraulic pumps with three phase AC motors being most common.. Pneumatic. Bleed air powered motors are utilized on some aircraft to drive hydraulic pumps.. Hydraulic. A Power Transfer Unit (PTU) allows the hydraulic pressure of one hydraulic system to drive a pump to pressurize a second hydraulic system without any transfer of hydraulic fluid. Depending upon the installation, a PTU can be single or bi-directional.. Ram Air Turbine. In the event of an emergency, some aircraft have a Ram Air Turbine (RAT) that can be extended into airstream to generate hydraulic pressure..
