Hydraulic system overheat, loss of pressure or fluid contamination can all result in the loss of the hydraulic system and the loss of function of those components that it powers. Fluid contamination can also result in loss of hydraulic system efficiency, fluid leaks, excessive component wear and premature component failure.
