The primary defense against hydraulic fluid contamination lies in robust maintenance practices. Any fluids used to service the system must be as specified in the AOM and fluid types should not be mixed. Care should be taken to ensure that the fluid is not contaminated prior to use and that no contaminants are introduced to the system while topping up the fluid. System filters should be cleaned or replaced as per manufacturer's guidelines. In the event of a System Overheat or Loss of Pressure, following the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) or ECAM checklists may result in recovery of the system. If the loss of pressure was as a result a total of loss of hydraulic fluid, the system is not recoverable.
