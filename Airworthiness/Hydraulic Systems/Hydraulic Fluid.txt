Fluid is the medium via which a hydraulic system transmits its energy and, theoretically, practically any fluid could be utilized. However, given the operating pressure (3000 to 5000 psi) that most aircraft hydraulic systems generate in combination with the environmental conditions and strict safety criteria under which the system must operate, the hydraulic fluid that is used should have the following properties:
