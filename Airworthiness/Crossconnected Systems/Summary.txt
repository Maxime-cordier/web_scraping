Cross connected systems create increased risk because they can compromise or reduce the effectiveness of the systems involved. There are several interventions to help reduce the risk of cross connecting systems. The primary intervention is clear, concise, and accurate maintenance manuals and strict adherence to these procedures by maintenance personnel. Other interventions also include hard fixes, soft fixes, and technological fixes. Some or all of these can be used to reduce the risk of cross connected systems.
