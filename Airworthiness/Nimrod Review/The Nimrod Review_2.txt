in 2003. the loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise (a ferry which sank after it departed Zeebrugge in 1987). the Kings Cross Fire (at a large London Underground railway station in 1987). the Marchioness Disaster (a pleasure boat which sank on the River Thames in London in 1989 after colliding with another boat). BP Texas City, 2005.. The Recommendations of the Review included the need for: A new Safety Culture. A new approach to Safety Cases. A new attitude to Aged Aircraft. A new Procurement Strategy. A new Military Airworthiness Authority. Unlike a Civil Aircraft Accident Investigation under ICAO Annex 13 provisions, this Review attributes blame for loss to a series of named organisations and individuals “whose conduct (in the view of the author of the Review) fell well below the standards which might reasonably have been expected of them at the time, given their rank, roles and responsibilities”. The author of the Review also states that “I have only named and criticised organisations and individuals where, in my view, it is necessary, fair, proportionate and in the public interest to do so”.
