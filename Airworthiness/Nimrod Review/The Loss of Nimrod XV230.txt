On 2 September 2006, a Nimrod aircraft, being operated over Afghanistan by the UK Royal Air Force, caught fire shortly after air-to-air refuelling (AAR) had taken place and crashed after a loss of control caused by the effects of the fire. All 14 of occupants of the aircraft were killed. Although the loss occurred in a military operational theatre, it was not related in any way to the military task being undertaken except insofar as the immediate origin of the accident was the AAR.
