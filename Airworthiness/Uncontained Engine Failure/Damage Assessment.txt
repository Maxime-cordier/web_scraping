Each uncontained failure will result in a “unique” combination of collateral damage to the aircraft and there will be little, if any, guidance in the AFM for dealing with this type of potential failure. The aircrew must, therefore, be especially vigilant when dealing with an uncontained engine failure. The engine failure itself should be dealt with IAW the manufacturer’s prescribed shutdown procedures. However, it is the collateral damage that carries the greater potential risk and that will require creative pilot assessment to ensure a positive outcome is achieved.
