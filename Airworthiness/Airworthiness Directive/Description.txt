ADs form part of the ongoing obligations of aircraft certification authorities under Part-21 with regard to the continuing airworthiness of aircraft. They address recommendations for improvements or corrective actions to be implemented by the holder of the Certificate of Airworthiness. The issue of an AD has the effect of making such recommendations mandatory. The ADs contain mandatory instructions to carry out work on aircraft, engine, propeller or component in order to address an unsafe condition which exists, or is likely to exist, or could develop. It may be issued by any National Aviation Authority (NAA) which has responsibility for the regulation of design of those aircraft or components. It is usual for an NAA to require compliance with an AD issued by another NAA with such responsibility where such aircraft are operated by or maintained by regulated organisations within its jurisdiction.
