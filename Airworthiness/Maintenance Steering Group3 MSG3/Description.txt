MSG-3 (Maintenance Steering Group) ‘Operator/Manufacturer Scheduled Maintenance Development’ is a document developed by the Airlines For America (A4A) (formerly the Air Transport Association or ATA). It aims to present a methodology to be used for developing scheduled maintenance tasks and intervals, which will be acceptable to the regulatory authorities, the operators and the manufacturers. The main idea behind this concept is to recognise the inherent reliability of aircraft systems and components, avoid unnecessary maintenance tasks and achieve increased efficiency.The underlying principles are that: Maintenance only effective if task applicable. No improvement in reliability by excessive maintenance. Needless tasks can also introduce human error. Few complex items exhibit wear out. Monitoring generally more effective than hard-time overhaul - Condition-based maintenance (sometimes known as CBM). Reliability only improved by modification. Maintenance may not be needed if failure cheaper. MSG-3 is widely used to develop initial maintenance requirements for modern commercial aircraft which are published as a Maintenance Review Board Report (MRBR). It has two volumes (1 for fixed wing aircraft and 2 for rotorcraft), and its application will proceed alongside the Type Certification process.
