A type certificate is issued by the National Aviation Authority (NAA) of the State of the Operator stating the airworthiness standard for the aircraft type, model, aircraft engine or aircraft propeller. Some States use a different term for type certificate, such as type approval certificate, certificate of approval, or Fiche de Navigabilité. The initial Type Certificate is likely to be obtained in the State of Manufacture. A key annex to any Type Certificate is a Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS)
