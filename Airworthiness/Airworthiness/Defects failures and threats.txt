A defect may have a significant effect on safety and, if not rectified, or only partly rectified, may also be a cause for an accident at a later time. Inappropriate crew actions in response to a malfunction which arises in flight may also lead to a worse outcome. In such cases, an investigation should analyse the crew responses as well as the underlying airworthiness issues. However, in many cases, the flight-crew successfully recovers an aircraft after anomalies occur. The following causal factors are taken from the UK Military Aviation Authority (MAA) Handbooks for Structural Integrity, Systems Integrity and Propulsion Integrity. This is a long list of possible failures or threats which may affect the airworthiness of an aircraft. Some are physical process e.g. overload and fatigue, whereas some relate to human factors and obsolescence. Overload. Operation outside the certificated limits such as those laid down for flight in ice or snow conditions.. Component degradation due to fatigue, creep, fretting, wear or corrosion, depending on the system or component. Accidental damage (AD) and environmental damage (ED). Procedural (design, manufacturing, maintenance or supply) error and human factors. Inadequate or incomplete maintenance.. Errors in maintenance which may result in a fault becoming obvious a long period after the error was originally made.. Ageing components. Change of usage or unmonitored operation. Lack of configuration control. Obsolescence and/or legislation change. Fuel and fuel system hazard. Lack of adequate oversight of the operator, its practices and policies including training, operation and maintenance by the regulator.. Deficiencies in the process which led to the issue of the original aircraft Type Certificate..
