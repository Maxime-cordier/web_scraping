The following information sources, independent of the pitot static systems, can provide reliable information for situational awareness: rpm, and fuel flow, for engine thrust indication (not EPR, which may be unreliable);. Pitch and bank display;. FPV (Flight Path Vector) if available and derived from inertial and not barometric sources;. Radio height when below 2500ft agl;. EGPWS. Stick Shaker - may not always be activated but if it is, it is independently reliable;. Navigation systems can provide ground speed and position information (GPS can also provide altitude information);. Radio navigation aids and RNAV.. ATC, in a radar or ADS-B environment, can provide aircraft ground speed.. If TAS can be determined, a rough approximation of IAS at altitude can be calculated by the fomula: IAS=TAS – (FL÷2) eg 400TAS FL300 = 250IAS.. Note: Some aircraft systems are configured, as a safety measure, such that stick shakers and pushers will not operate if there is disagreement between systems. Thus, if the aircraft approaches and/or enters a stall, these safety features might not activate. However, if the stick shaker does activate, it should, in the absence of clear contrary indications, be believed.
