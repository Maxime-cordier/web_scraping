In balancing maintenance workload against workers’ capacities, consideration must be given to human factors, including especially Fatigue and Stress. Fatigue, in particular, needs to be managed through an effective scheduling and rostering system that aims to prevent the onset of fatigue and also responds to symptoms of fatigue manifest in the workplace. Maintenance of aircraft often occurs at night and at weekends to ensure that flying programmes which commence early mornings can be fulfilled. However, increasing numbers of airlines run flying schedules 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Rotating shift-work and working at night impact on physical, mental and emotional performance, and therefore, reduce a persons maximum workload capacity. The effects can be both short and long-term. There will always be a commercial pressure to maximise efficiency and reduce costs. As aircraft, engines, and equipment all become more efficient and reliable, two key indicators become more prominent: Therefore, any drive to reduce labour costs beyond a critical point will increase risk and the costs associated with losses from incidents and accidents. For example, in every daily/nightly shift there is “dead” time at the beginning and end, therefore the pressure is to increase shift periods, thereby reducing the percentage of unproductive time. However, increasing shift periods increases the risk of short-term fatigue and reduced vigilance and performance. Shift planning, rotating and rostering need to be scientifically-based to maximise resources, and will benefit from being integrated with a Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS). Consideration needs to be given to: Because, as already mentioned above, some unplanned workload may exceed the predicted contingency, maintenance organisations will rely on the use of overtime for high workload periods. The impact of unplanned overtime needs to be monitored and kept within boundaries.
