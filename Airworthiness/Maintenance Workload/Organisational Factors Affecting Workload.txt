Many factors affect an organisation’s ability to meet its workload demands, including: staff shortages – in numbers but also in specialist roles. low levels of experience, knowledge and skills throughout the workforce. lack of, or unavailability of facilities and other resources. equipment malfunction or failure. non-existent, or inadequate task analyses – matching manpower (FTE) with each tasks to enhance shift planning and also aiding workspace design to assist workflow. poor culture, including leadership, supervision and teamwork. extreme ebbs and flows in peak/off-peak workload – i.e. an inability to plan and spread workload effectively.
