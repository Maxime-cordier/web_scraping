The intervals of maintenance are parameters set within the Approved Maintenance Schedule (AMS), which is in turn based on the Maintenance Planning Document (MPD). These will be set according to different criteria, mostly depending on how well damage can be detected and failure predicted [CAA, 2017]: "Preventative process in which known deterioration of an Item is limited to an acceptable level by the maintenance actions. Carried out at periods related to time in service (e.g. calendar time, number of cycles, number of landings).". “Preventative process in which Item are inspected or tested, at specified periods, to an appropriate standard to determine whether it can continue in service. Such an inspection / test may reveal a need for maintenance action.. Fundamental purpose of On-Condition is to remove an Item before its failure in service.”. “Information on Items gained from monitoring is collected, analysed and interpreted on a continuing basis as a means deciding whether or not to implement corrective procedures.”. This process is normally automated and may form part of the aircraft’s on-board health management system.. Flight Hours (FH), for items that are in constant operation e.g. Fuel Pumps, Electric Generators. Flight Cycles (FC), for items operated once or twice per flight e.g. Landing gear, air starter, brakes, hull pressurisations. Calendar Time (Cal), for items exposed whether operated or not e.g. Fire Extinguishers, Corrosion to Structure. Operating hours, for items not operated every flight, or otherwise independent of FH or FC e.g. APU operation..
