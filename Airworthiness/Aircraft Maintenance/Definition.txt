No aircraft is so tolerant of neglect that it is safe in the absence of an effective inspection and maintenance programme. The processes that affect an aircraft are deterioration with age (e.g. fatigue, wear and corrosion) as well as chance failures (e.g. tyre burst, excess structural loads). Aircraft maintenance can be defined in a number of ways and the following may help understand the different aspects: “Those actions required for restoring or maintaining an item in a serviceable condition including servicing, repair, modification, overhaul, inspection and determination of condition”. [World Airlines Technical Operations Glossary] “Maintenance is the action necessary to sustain or restore the integrity and performance of the airplane” [Hessburg, 2001] “Maintenance is the process of ensuring that a system continually performs its intended function at its designed-in level of reliability and safety.” [Kinnison and Siddiqui, 2013]
