The third form of maintenance can be termed as “Workshop” or just Shop maintenance. This covers maintenance on components when removed from aircraft e.g. engines, APU, seats. Sometimes this is carried out within the same organisation as the Base Maintenance, but sometimes special companies carry out this work separately.
