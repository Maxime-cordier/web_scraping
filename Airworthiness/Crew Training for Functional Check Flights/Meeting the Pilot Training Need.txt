As a result of a succession of accidents and incidents arising from a steadily increasing number of airworthiness function / check flights, it has become clear that formal supplementary training is needed for flight crew expected to conduct the more demanding types of such fights. In the past, this training has not been supported by aircraft manufacturers and has been left to the discretion of operators with in many cases little, if any, intervention from the regulatory agencies who oversee the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) holders. A notable exception to this has been the availability of the UK CAA Check Flight Handbook. This mindset is now beginning to change and aircraft manufacturers (notably Airbus) are applying their unique expertise, gained from test flying by qualified test pilots on new and pre-delivery aircraft, to develop training courses which will equip selected line pilots to carry out airworthiness function / check flights, both as an aircraft commander and as a co-pilot. In respect of the latter, recent experience has demonstrated that co-pilot ability to carry out an effective monitoring pilot (PM) role, and thereby support the safe conduct of the flight, has been severely limited by both their level of understanding of aircraft systems and the often steep authority and knowledge gradient between the two pilots.
