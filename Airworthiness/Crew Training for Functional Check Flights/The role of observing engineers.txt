Manufacturers, such as Airbus, typically recommend that all flights where aircraft systems will be intentionally degraded should be carried out with an appropriately qualified and experienced aircraft engineer (or alternatively a third pilot who has been trained to the same level as the designated aircraft commander) occupying one of the flight deck supernumerary seats. The role of this third person should be clearly defined in relation to the primacy of the operating flight crew and the aircraft commander in particular.
