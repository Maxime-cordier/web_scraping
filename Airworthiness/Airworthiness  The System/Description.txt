An aircraft is airworthy "when it meets its type design and is in a condition for safe operation" [FAA, 1998] and therefore starting a flight in an airworthy aircraft is an important part of the achieving acceptable levels of safety. The regulations require nothing less than this. The effort which goes into delivering airworthy aircraft stems from a huge, complex and highly regulated industry. Like the rest of aviation, it involves human interventions and is subject to human traits: see An Overview of Human Factors in Aviation Maintenance for an example.
