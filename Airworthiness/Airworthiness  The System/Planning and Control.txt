The control of in-service aircraft is both complex and vital. While day to day flying continues, maintenance technicians rectify problems reported by the flight-crew as well as those found by inspection. In addition, other technical aspects of the aircraft are monitored, including its flight hours, the performance of its engines and systems, and also less obvious things such as planning the cleaning of the exterior and interior. An airline may operate a maintenance control centre on a 24 hour basis. This technical centre (often called “Maintrol”) has much of the data relevant to each aircraft and also keeps in constant touch with aircraft via radio and data downlink. This may usefully be co-located with airline Operations department. The role of Maintrol is to minimise operational technical disruption as well as ensuring that day to day maintenance is performed at, or prior to, the period set in the Maintenance Programme. For operators based in EU nations, and others who choose to follow EASA regulations, a Continuing Airworthiness Management Organisation (CAMO) must be in place. This is an (approved) organisation responsible for implementation of continuing airworthiness management tasks. Their role includes the regular scrutiny of maintenance history compared to the requirements of the Maintenance Programme. In the EU, this process is results in the issue of an Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC) which validates the associated Certificate of Airworthiness. Certain countries may carry out similar reviews which are referred to as Certificate of Maintenance Review. Much of what the regulator requires in terms of continuing airworthiness is dealt with by the foregoing activity which will include its oversight by a Quality Assurance system.
