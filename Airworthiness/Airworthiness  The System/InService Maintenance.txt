Aircraft, like any complex system, require day to day care, which can range from changing a worn tyre to a complex investigation of a digital electronic system fault. This work is dealt with by Maintenance Technicians who hold an appropriate license issued by the NAA. Faults reported by the pilot are entered into a log book (the Aircraft Technical Log) and, after rectifying the fault, the technician signs for doing the work with the individual’s licence number. This certification is termed a Certificate of Release to Service (CRS). Modern systems permit the pilot and technician to record the fault and the fix using E-Tech Log on a tablet computer. This is part of an on-board system known as the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). On a few occasions, the reported defect cannot be immediately fixed and, provided that the fault is listed as “Acceptable” in an approved manual known as the Minimum Equipment List (MEL), the aircraft may continue in operation for a limited period of time until the fault can be rectified. The Master MEL is issued by the airworthiness authority, and each operator must prepare their own version, just the MEL. This must be no less restrictive than the Master MEL, and must be followed with care by both the pilot and the maintenance technician.
