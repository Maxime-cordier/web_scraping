Each National Aviation Authority (NAA) - or in the case of the EU - EASA - is the Airworthiness Authority for that State and is responsible for developing the regulatory regime which will apply. An Airworthiness Authority will usually announce an intention to issue new or revised regulations, including mandatory tasks, through a EASA Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) or US FAA Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) which allows for industry consultation before changes are made. In a few cases, the nature of the change is too important and/or to urgent to permit this, so regulators retain the authority to introduce a requirement without consulting industry. In the case of EASA, the setting of policy and rulemaking is by the EASA organisation, while implementation is overseen by the relevant NAA. This includes oversight of operating standards. The NAAs also carry out most of the work involved in ensuring that organisations in their territory meet requirements before approving them. Close cooperation exists between the worldâ€™s main regulators in attempting to harmonise, as far as practical, their individual standards.
