Every type of aircraft, through its service life, will be subject to changes which come about from in-service problems as well as improvements sought by the owner or operator. These changes have varying titles but by far the most common is the Service Bulletin (SB). SBs are issued by the manufacturer, which can be the aircraft OEM, the engine OEM or equipment manufacturer. In addition, SBs can fall into more than one category. Some, the less vital ones, are optional in character but some are important to safety and/or reliability. In the latter case, and after consultation between the manufacturer and NAA of the Type Certificate issuing country, the SB will become mandatory, and is then known as an Airworthiness Directive. Modifications also need to be approved, depending on whether they are classed as “Major” or “Minor”. They can be variable in scope; for example the range of work from a change in seating configuration to a Passenger to Freighter conversion. To accomplish this safely, approved design organisations are necessary to engineer and produce the Service or Modification Bulletin, which may be approved as Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) if not designed by the Type Certificate Holder.
