From its very first flight, an aircraft progressively accumulates flying hours, flight cycles (a takeoff to landing is one flight cycle) and naturally elapsed calendar periods. These variables are tracked to ensure that the requirements of the Maintenance Programme are met. The latter may be termed Block or Equalised Maintenance. Daily inspections are carried out covering a small number of important tasks as well as replenishment of lubricants and other fluids. At longer intervals (for example between 750 and 1000 flight hours), an A Check would be carried out, if the schedule is following a Block maintenance format. This involves more extensive checks and would be performed by Line Maintenance personnel. The B Check is no longer used and therefore the next check is a partial C Check. By carefully dividing the requirements of a C Check into a small number of packages, the aircraft will avoid lengthy time out of service. This practice is termed Equalised Maintenance. A typical C Check will be carried out by Base Maintenance personnel using proper accommodation, hangars and access equipment. This check will require the aircraft to be out of service for a number of days. The final check in the Block check format of maintenance is the D Check. This is a major activity when a very detailed inspection of the whole aircraft is performed. Often such items as landing gear and control surfaces are removed for service and the interior equipment such as seats and galleys are also removed for refurbishment. The D Check is both costly and time consuming. Many operators sub-contract this work to reduce cost and avoid taking up their hangar space which may be used for smaller work programmes. Equally, some operators use the onset of a D Check programme to change their fleet to new aircraft thus providing a new owner with a lower cost aircraft after the necessary D check is carried out.
