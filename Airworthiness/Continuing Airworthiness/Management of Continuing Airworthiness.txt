For operators based in EU nations, and others who choose to follow EASA regulations, a Continuing Airworthiness Management Organisation (CAMO) must be in place. This is an (approved) organisation responsible for implementation of continuing airworthiness management tasks. According to EU 2018/1139 Annex V Section 6 [EU, 2018], the owner or â€“ if designated by contract - the lessee is responsible for the continuing airworthiness of an aircraft and shall ensure that no flight takes place unless: Reference should also be made to M.A 201 in EASA Part M [EC, 2014], which gives more detail concerning the responsibilities for continuing airworthiness. For operators based outside the EU, for whom EASA regulations do not apply, continuing airworthiness is still managed in a controlled manner but the regulations are within the rules for the operator. Although the owner bears the legal responsibility for continuing airworthiness, there is very much a shared responsibility between: For each of its aircraft, the approved CAMO is required to carry out the following functions. Although these are drawn from EASA Part M, Sub Part G M.A.708 [EC, 2014], the activities would be similar to those required of any operator: Continuing Airworthiness is therefore not just the maintenance of aircraft and equipment, but also involves monitoring performance of products in service. This will include recording service difficulties to assess significance with respect to safety and airworthiness for the specific aircraft/product involved and for similar aircraft/products. Timely response is required where airworthiness is affected, which means devising and provisioning rectification action, and promulgating the necessary information to restore safety levels. Inspection methods and intervals, repair actions, modifications and timescales are all part of Continuing Airworthiness, as are feedback to design/production and formal airworthiness review (or Airworthiness Review Certificate, ARC).
