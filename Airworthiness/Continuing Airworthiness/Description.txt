The ultimate responsibility for continued airworthiness is assigned in ICAO Annex 8 to the State of Design but the programme to achieve continuing airworthiness is a matter for the State of Registry. It is useful to compare Continued and Continuing as they are sometimes used interchangeably. Continued Airworthiness is also known as Type Airworthiness [MAA, 2016] or Initial Airworthiness [EC, 2014] Continued Airworthiness = “All the actions associated with the upkeep of a type design and the associated approved data through life.” - Source MAA02 glossary [MAA, 2016] Continuing Airworthiness = “All of the processes ensuring that, at any time in its operating life, the aircraft complies with the airworthiness requirements in force and is in a condition for safe operation” - Source EC1321/2014 Article 2 [EC, 2014]
