NTOs are generally used in the context of flight conditions’ approval; however, when there is a connection between two design organisations that are concurring on the same topic, the primary design organisation could issue an NTO to confirm that there is no safety impact on the existing design. In that case the NTO will support the compliance demonstration without constituting means of compliance. Under European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) airworthiness requirements, repair design data to permanent or temporary repairs under the provisions of Part-21 on ‘unrepaired damage’ must be approved. NTOs from the type certificate (TC) holder or any similar form of agreement with the TC Holder are not acceptable and do not constitute legal certification in accordance with Part-21 dealing with initial airworthiness or other applicable EASA decisions. Similarly, under the airworthiness requirements of the relevant section of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR), an NTO letter or statement that a particular maintenance or alteration action is design engineering representative (DER) approvable does not constitute Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval. However, such a statement when supported along with other technical information may provide the basis for a field inspector or delegate approval. When evaluating the compliance of data representing a particular maintenance or alteration action or continue-in-service condition, the data must include substantiated data to support the approval.
