The operation of an aircraft with systems intentionally degraded in order to validate the operational status of an aircraft, or certain aircraft systems, may occur on functional check flights. A very thorough flight crew pre flight plan can help reduce the chances of unexpected events occurring in flight. Some of the potential issues and mitgations for this risk are examined in the more general article "Mitigating Risk for Non Standard Flights" and examples of Accidents and Serious Incidents can be found at "Accident and Serious Incident Reports: Non-Revenue Flights". A recognition that a specific process is needed for the selection and training of flight crew who are to perform this type of flight is essential, and this aspect is examined further in the article Crew Training for Functional Check Flights. Consideration should also be given to items such as minimum/maximum crew, weather requirements, and minimum and maximum speeds and altitudes for all portions of the functional check flight.
