Before conducting a maintenance check flight, the aircraft operators are required to determine the applicable level of the MCF as follows: a) ‘Level A’ MCF for a flight where the use of abnormal or emergency procedures, as defined in the aircraft flight manual, is expected, or where a flight is required to prove the functioning of a backup system or other safety devices. b) ‘Level B’ MCF for any MCF other than a ‘Level A’ one.
