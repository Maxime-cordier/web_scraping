Part-NCO governs MCFs with other-than-complex motor-powered aircraft. In addition to the standard considerations before a typical flight (weather, aircraft weight and balance, pre-flight inspection, checklists, etc.), the pilot is required to inform air traffic control of the particular MCF, if needed, agree on the appropriate airspace, understand the airworthiness status of the aircraft, assess the complexity of the flight and develop appropriate strategies to mitigate potential risks. When selecting a flight crew member for a MCF, the operator is required to consider the aircraft complexity and the level of the maintenance check flight. The pilot-in-command has the role to identify the need for additional crew members or task specialists, or both, before each intended maintenance check flight, taking into consideration the expected flight crew member or task specialist workload and the risk assessment.
