A maintenance check flight (MCF) is a flight of an aircraft with an airworthiness certificate or with a permit to fly which is carried out for troubleshooting purposes or to check the functioning of one or more systems, parts, or appliances after maintenance, if the functioning of the systems, parts or appliances cannot be established during ground checks. A MCF is carried out in any of the following situations: a) As required by the aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) or any other maintenance data issued by a design approval holder being responsible for the continuing airworthiness of the aircraft; b) After maintenance, as required by the operator or proposed by the organisation responsible for the continuing airworthiness of the aircraft; c) As requested by the maintenance organisation for verification of a successful defect rectification; or d) To assist with fault isolation or troubleshooting.
