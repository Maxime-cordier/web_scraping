Part-SPO governs MCFs with complex motor-powered aircraft. Operators conducting a Level A maintenance check flight are required to describe those operations and associated procedures in the operations manual or in a dedicated maintenance check flight manual, update the manual when necessary, inform all affected personnel of the manual and of its changes that are relevant to their duties and provide the competent authority with the manual and its updates. The operators are also required to establish procedures to identify the need for additional task specialists. For a Level A maintenance check flight, the operators are required to define in their manuals the policy for other persons on board. In addition, a task specialist or additional pilot is required in the flight crew compartment to assist the flight crew members, unless the aircraft configuration does not permit it or the operator can justify, considering the flight crew members workload based on the flight programme, that the flight crew members does not require additional assistance.
