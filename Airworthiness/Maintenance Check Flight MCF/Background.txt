Several accidents and incidents have occurred involving aircraft that had just undergone incomplete or inadequate maintenance or during flights conducted to verify adequate maintenance of aircraft. In 2017, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued opinion No 01/2017 to mitigate the risks linked to MCFs because it found that the issue of MCFs was not sufficiently addressed in the EASA AIR OPS regulations. The opinion proposed establishing safety requirements to adequately select pilots and apply procedures for MCFs while distinguishing between MCFs with complex motor-powered aircraft and MCFs with other-than-complex motor-powered aircraft. At the end of the rulemaking activity, MCF requirements were embedded in EASA AIR OPS Part-NCO and Part-SPO. Operators conducting the higher risk category of these MCFs with complex motor-powered aircraft (under Part-SPO) are required to develop their own procedures and ensure thorough coordination between the operation, the continuing airworthiness management organisation (CAMO) and the maintenance organisation concerned.
