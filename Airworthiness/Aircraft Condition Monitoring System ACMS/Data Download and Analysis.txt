One or more quick access recorders, incorporated into the ACMS, facilitate the download of the raw data collected by the various system sensors. Data download or "dumping" can be done between flights as a maintenance task, and requires little time or specialised equipment. Some operators delegate this task to the flight crew when the aircraft is away from a maintenance base and transmission of the data file is sometimes accomplished using a mobile phone. Automatic data transfer, using the ACARS (Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System), or similar systems, is a common practice. In this situation, the data will be transmitted regularly, with transmission timing based on a specified set of parameters: for example, at a specified time interval whilst in cruise or at engine shutdown at the end of the sector. Aircraft utilising automatic data transfer will normally also generate and transmit an immediate report in the event of an exceedance or failure. Raw data is most often subject to computer based analysis to identify trends and anomalies prior to human review. These actions can be accomplished by the operator's maintenance organisation or they can be contracted to a third-party service provider. Trends indicative of a pending failure will result in allocation of maintenance resources, parts procurement, and adjustment of the aircraft utilisation schedule followed by the appropriate overhaul or repair, either by the Operator or at a third party maintenance facility.
