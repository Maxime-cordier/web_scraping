The ADREP reporting system is based on the use of a common reporting taxonomy, which is periodically updated in cooperation with Contracting States. The current version of the taxonomy is available here. States are also urged to use this taxonomy in their national reporting to achieve international harmonisation and thereby enable the exchange and aggregation of occurrence information. Cooperation between ICAO and EUROCONTROL has ensured a taxonomy for the ATM sector harmonised between ICAO ADREP and ESARR 2 requirements. The following ICAO ADREP material is stored on SKYbrary bookshelf, for latest versions please refer to the ICAO ADREP 2000 website. ICAO ADREP 2000 Taxonomy, 17 September 2010.
