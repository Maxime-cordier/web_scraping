Operators should have a clearly stated flight path management policy as follows: The policy should highlight and stress that the responsibility for flight path management remains with the pilots at all times. Focus the policy on flight path management, rather than automated systems.. Identify appropriate opportunities for manual flight operations.. Recognize the importance of automated systems as a tool (among other tools) to support the flight path management task, and provide operational policy for the use of automated systems.. Distinguish between guidance and control.. Encourage flightcrews to tell Air Traffic “unable” when appropriate.. Adapt to the operator’s needs and operations.. Develop consistent terminology for automated systems, guidance, control, and other terms that form the foundation of the policy.. Develop guidance for development of policies for managing information automation..
