Increases passenger comfort;. Improved flight path control and reduced weather minima;. Systems monitoring displays coupled with diagnostic assistance systems (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM)/Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS)) support enhanced pilots’ and maintenance staff’s understanding of aircraft system states. However, when faced with a complex failure event, such as the Airbus 380 engine break-up after take off from Singapore (2010), the normally ‘simple to understand’ failure information can swamp the crew and either hinder diagnosis or distract the crew from the principle task of FLY THE AIRCRAFT;. Automation can relieve pilots from repetitive or non-rewarding tasks for which humans are less suited, though it invariably changes the pilots’ active involvement in operating the aircraft into a monitoring role, which humans are particularly poor at doing effectively or for long periods. As an example, pilots who invariably fly with Autothrottle (AT) engaged can quickly lose the habit of scanning speed indications. Therfore, when the AT disengages, either by design or following a malfunction, the pilots will not notice or react to even large speed deviations. (Amsterdam B737-800 in 2009). Good automation reduces workload, frees attentional resources to focus on other tasks but the need to ‘manage’ the automation, particularly when involving data entry or retrieval through a key-pad, places additional tasks on the pilot that can also increase pilot workload. In contrast, poor automation can reduce the operators’ situational awareness and create significant workload challenges when systems fail..
