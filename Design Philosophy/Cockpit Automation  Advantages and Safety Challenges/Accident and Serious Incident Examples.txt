Automation Confusion: The following are just a few examples of confusion arising from mismanagement of automation which had serious or potentially serious consequences for a serviceable aeroplane: B777-200 San Francisco (2013) - The crew failed to notice that mismanagement of the aircraft during an approach, using an unfamiliar level of automation in preference to the visual approach for which they had been cleared, had resulted in the A/T setting thrust to idle. They then delayed a decision to initiate a go around until it was no longer possible.. A340-300 Paris CDG (2012) - Crew confusion and near loss of control when the automatics were allowed to capture a false ILS GS lobe during a Cat 3 approach at Paris CDG in IMC.. A320 Tel Aviv (2012) - The crew comprehensively mismanaged the automation both during the approach and during the go around which, subsequently, became necessary. The Investigation identified significant issues with the crew understanding of automation.. B737-800 Amsterdam (2009) - The crew failed to notice that they were attempting to fly the approach with thrust at idle and their attempt at a last minute recovery was mismanaged..
