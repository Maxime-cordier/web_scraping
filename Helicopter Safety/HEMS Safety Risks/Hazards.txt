There are several unique hazards faced by HEMS operators. The time pressures, planning challenges and environmental factors associated with air ambulance operations makes them inherently high risk opertions. Contributory factors identified in an AMPA (Air Medical Physician Association) investigation of HEMS accidents[1] include: Time Pressure: The condition of a patient, and the time critical requirement to get that patient to an appropriate medical facility, is the major reason for an air ambulance to be tasked to support a medical emergency. That time pressure means that pre-flight planning and mission preparation are necessarily compressed and can lead to incomplete planning or inappropriate decisions.. Environmental Factors: A significant proportion of HEMS operations take place at night and often in poor weather. The crew is under considerable pressure to carry out the mission regardless of the environmental and geographic conditions. Approximately a quarter of all HEMS accidents were weather related, with most occurring because of reduced visibility and IMC while the helicopter was conducting the en route phase of the mission. Inaccurate or out of date weather forecasts contribute to the risk.. CFIT: Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT)is a significant challenge. That is the case particularly in the takeoff or landing phases of flight, as well as collision with objects (for example wires and towers).. Communications: Communications problems with air traffic control (ATC) or a lack of communications due to remote locations and terrain can increase the risk.. The AMPA report also stated that HEMS accidents occurred more often when flight crews were en route to pick up a patient than at any other time during flight.
