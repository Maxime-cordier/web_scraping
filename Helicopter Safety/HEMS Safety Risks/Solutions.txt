Regulation: Specific regulations for HEMS operators specifying minimum safe operating standards and risk reduction techniques for HEMS operations can assist in reducing the risk.. Technical: Accurate navigation systems, terrain awareness and warning systems, Night Vision Imaging Systems (NVIS), suitable means of illumination to identify landing area to enable safe approach, landing and take-off are all helpful in reducing risk.. Meteorology: Risk can be reduced by providing a means of observing, recording, and reporting accurate and timely local weather conditions, including cloud base and visibility, at HEMS operating bases.. Risk Management: Risk assessment must include, but not be limited to, terrain and obstacle awareness, inadvertent entry into Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) at low level, pilot disorientation/loss of situational awareness, accurate and timely operating base and en-route weather information, ground risks to personnel at the operating site, pilot NVIS-related fatigue, and illumination of final approach and take-off area..
