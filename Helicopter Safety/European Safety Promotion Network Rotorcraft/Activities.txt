The ESPN-R develops, disseminates and evaluates safety promotion material and actions in support of the R.COM, EASA and the industry. The voluntary group also helps to implement safety promotion actions from the EPAS and from the EASA Rotorcraft Safety Roadmap. It also can suggest safety promotion actions from inclusion in the EPAS. The scope of ESPN-Râ€™s activities include operations and safety management systems, training and emerging safety-enhancing technologies, for which research and development material, studies, previous EHEST work and expert advice is considered.
