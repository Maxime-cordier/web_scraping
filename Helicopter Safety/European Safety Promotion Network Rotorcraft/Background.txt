The European Safety Promotion Network Rotorcraft (ESPN-R) was established in January 2017 by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Rotorcraft Sectorial Committee, which is now called simply the Rotorcraft Committee (R.COM). The R.COM is one of 10 stakeholder advisory bodies (SABs) that provide EASA with a forum for consultation on agency priorities at the strategic and technical levels. The SABs, Member Statesâ€™ Advisory Body (MAB) and Technical Bodies (TeBs) provide consultation on all aspects of the rulemaking process and also contribute to the Agency Rulemaking Programme and the European Plan for Aviation Safety (EPAS).
