Coaxial rotors are two main rotors mounted on one mast, sharing the same axis of rotation but turning in opposite directions, one on top of the other. The control along the vertical axis is produced as a result of different lifts, thus differential torque, of the two rotor discs. The helicopter will yaw to the left if the clock wise rotating rotor produces more lift, and it will yaw to the right if more lift is produced by the counter-clock wise rotating rotor. The drag produced by the rotors is quite large due to the interference of airflows, so these helicopters do not normally have a high cruising speed. Mounting rotors closer together, which is possible only with rigid rotors, reduces the amount of drag produced.
