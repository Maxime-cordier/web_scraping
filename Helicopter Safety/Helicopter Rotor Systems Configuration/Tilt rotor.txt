The rotors are mounted at the edge of the wings, on nacelles that rotate in order to transition the rotors from the vertical position (to provide vertical lift like a side by side rotor configuration helicopter), to the horizontal position (where they provide horizontal lift, or thrust, just like in airplanes). Both lift and propulsion are then generated by the rotors, which act as helicopter main rotors when in the vertical position, and as airplane propellers when in the horizontal position. Lift is then provided by fixed wings.
