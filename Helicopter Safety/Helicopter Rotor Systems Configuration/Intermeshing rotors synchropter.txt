A helicopter with two rotors turning in opposite directions and mounted on two masts slightly inclined towards each other, so that the blades intermesh (without colliding), is called a synchropter. The two rotors mesh with one another, like a gearwheel. This configuration does not require a tail rotor, since the anti-torque action is performed by the counter-rotation of the rotors. Synchropters have high stability and powerful lifting capabilities.
