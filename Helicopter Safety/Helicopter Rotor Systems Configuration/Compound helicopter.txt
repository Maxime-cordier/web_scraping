A compound helicopter is a hybrid aircraft which acts both like an airplane and a helicopter. It is capable of higher speeds that a normal helicopter.The propellers provide thrust, and are driven from the power-plants which also drive the main rotor. During hovering and lower speed flight, the main rotor provides the lift and thrust for the aircraft. At faster velocities thrust is provided by the propeller(s), while the main rotor is slowed down (or acts in autorotation â€“ like a gyrodyne) to avoid drag from the advancing blade tip, and unloaded to avoid retreating blade stall. Most of the vertical lift is then provided by small fixed wings.
