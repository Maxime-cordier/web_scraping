Early attempts to forecast the triggered-strike risk have resulted in forecasts which had high false alert levels but work at the UK Meteorological Office has led to the validation of an algorithm based on outside air temperature and precipitation rate. Evaluation of this method against past instances of recorded helicopter strikes has returned an 80% success rate. The altitude band between 2000 feet and 3000 feet was of primary interest for North Sea helicopter operations and here, risk was characterised by precipitation rates above 4 mm/hour when the static air temperature was in the range -2°C to -6°C and the freezing level was between 1000 feet and 3000 feet. The same algorithm was also found to correctly forecast a similar proportion of natural lightning strikes recorded in the operating area during winter 2010–2011. It has been found that the areas of risk identified are usually small and so it should be relatively easy to plan helicopter operations so as to avoid high risk. The information from the study has also effectively defined the circumstances in which triggered lightning strikes occur. More detail on the field trials of this model during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 winters is reported in a presentation given to the UK CAA by the UK Meteorological Office in May 2013.
