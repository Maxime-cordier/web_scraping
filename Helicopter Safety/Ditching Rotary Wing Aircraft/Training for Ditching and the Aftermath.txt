Full Flight Simulator practice of ditching by pilots is impossible because there is no data with which to meaningfully program the simulator. For rotary wing crew regularly operating offshore and their passengers, realistic practice of some aspects of evacuation and post evacuation scenarios is available and usually is a significant part of training/familiarisation. Regular training in helicopter underwater escape should continue throughout aircrew’s careers and is equally important for passengers. Although all helicopters operating offshore public transport are likely to be equipped with emergency floatation systems and Automatic Deployment Emergency Locator Beacons and the occupants provided with some form of survival suit and emergency breathing equipment, this preparation for survival after ditching addresses the need for prompt evacuation before any capsize of the floating helicopter. The installation of floats towards the top of the fuselage could clearly sustain a helicopter that had rolled on the water 90° to the vertical. However, such modifications carry significant technical challenge to avoid the risk of an inadvertent inflation interfering with the main rotor and creating an accident in the first place. As has already been stressed, for the rotary wing case, much of the training / familiarisation for the aftermath of ditching is of equal relevance to survivors of a water impact accident such as the unintended descent into the sea of a Super Puma Helicopter near Sumburgh, Shetland Isles in 2013 following which, UK CAA introduced new regulations regarding window size, the number and location of passengers and the placement of XBR (extra broad) passengers within the cabin.
