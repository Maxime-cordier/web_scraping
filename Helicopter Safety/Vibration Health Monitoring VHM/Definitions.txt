Vibration — Mechanical oscillation or motion about a reference point of equilibrium.. Vibration Health Monitoring — Use of data generated by processing vibration signals to detect incipient failure or degradation of mechanical integrity.. VHM Indicator — The result of processing sampled data by applying an algorithm to achieve a single value that relates to the health of particular component failure modes. Primary VHM indicators will be those that can be monitored directly for the purposes of generating alerts. Secondary VHM indicators are those that can be used in the diagnostic process after an alert is generated but are unsuitable for direct alert generation..
