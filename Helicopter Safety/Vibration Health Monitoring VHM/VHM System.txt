A VHM system typically comprises vibration sensors and associated wiring, data acquisition and processing hardware, the means of downloading data from the helicopter, a ground station and associated instructions for the operation of the system. The VHM system should measure vibration characteristics of rotating critical components during flight utilising suitable vibration sensors and recording equipment. The vibration measurements being processed, in order to generate VHM indicators, should normally relate to specific component failure modes or be capable of detecting changes that affect safe operation. A VHM system typically monitors a number of assemblies and component types, including the engine; gearboxes and associated shafts, gears and bearings; tail rotor drive shaft; engine to main gearbox input drive shafts; the oil cooler; and the main and tail rotors.
