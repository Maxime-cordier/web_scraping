The all-volunteer IHST effort is coordinated by an Executive Committee which is Co-Chaired by a senior representative of the US FAAâ€™s Rotorcraft Directorate and by the President of the Helicopter Association International (HAI). Other members represent America Helicopter Society (AHS) International, Helicopter Association of Canada (HAC), the European Helicopter Association, the European Helicopter Safety Team (EHEST), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), helicopter manufacturers, and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers(OGP). The initial effort focused on the US helicopter fleet and has grown to encompass international partners in Brazil, Canada, India, Australia, Gulf Cooperative Council, and Japan. In addition EHEST joined in 2007 to cover European helicopter fleet. Outreach efforts are underway in Russia, Mexico, South Africa and Korea. A summary of of IHST's recommendations for small operators is posted on HAI's website and can be reached here.
