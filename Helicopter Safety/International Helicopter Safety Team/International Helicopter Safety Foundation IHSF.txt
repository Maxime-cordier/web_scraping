In February 2019, IHST announced that it was changing its name to the International Helicopter Safety Foundation. In making the announcement, the organisation said that it had been incorporated as a not-for-profit foundation "because it has developed a permanent safety role within the worldwide helicopter industry. The aim of IHSF leadership is to continue that role into the future and to continue to support regional safety efforts around the world." Cooperating entities of the IHSF include the U.S. Helicopter Safety Team, the European Safety Promotion Network-Rotorcraft, the Brazil Helicopter Safety Team, the Asia-Pacific Helicopter Safety Team, the Russian Helicopter Industry Association, and other organizations focused on helicopter safety. In 2021, IHSF was rebranded as the Vertical Aviation Safety Team (VAST).
