may be used to adjust the flight path and to manoeuvre the aircraft to a suitable landing area. Autorotations to touch-down, or engine-off landings (EOL) are practiced routinely in almost all single-engine helicopters and are a required manoeuvre for skills tests. When conducting EOL training the instructor or examiner will retard the throttle or inhibit the engine governing system, so that the engine remains at idle power when the collective lever is raised. These manoeuvers are thus properly called simulated engine-off landings (SEOL), as the engine is not actually shut down.
