Waterspouts are similar to tornadoes in structure but occur over the sea rather than over the land and are not usually associated with a mid level (Mesocyclone) rotation within the parent Cumulus/Cumulonimbus (Cb) cloud. They are believed to be produced along surface airmass convergence boundaries. As the parent cumulus cloud develops in intensity, so the potential for a waterspout increases. Surface spray may be seen at the base of the waterspout yet, until the wind speed in the vortex reaches about 35 kts, the waterspout may not be visible. A fully developed waterspout will be quite distinctive with the funnel filled with water droplets. Waterspouts are less intense and smaller than tornadoes; a waterspout rarely lasts more than 30 minutes, is only 10 meters in diameter and approximately 100 meters deep. Nevertheless, they represent a significant hazard to low flying aircraft, particularly helicopters operating at low level over the sea, because they are not easy to see unless they fully developed. They are also rarely a stable vertical feature so they need to be given a wide berth.
