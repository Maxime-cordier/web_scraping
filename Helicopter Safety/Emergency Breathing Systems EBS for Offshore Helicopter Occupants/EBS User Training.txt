In the absence of applicable regulatory requirements, familiarisation with the EBS equipment provided is controlled by policy requirements, often voluntarily exceeded by operators. In the case of UK offshore operations, user understanding is currently imparted by means of initial and recurrent classroom training and a pre-flight briefing which is usually delivered through a video. The debate about the effectiveness of user familiarisation is ongoing, with the UK use of hybrid systems being the subject of ‘Safety Action’ documented by the UK AAIB in a Supplementary Bulletin issued in the course of their continuing investigation into a 2013 fatal water impact accident. More generally, it is recognised that the extent to which user training is required depends on whether the equipment in use is cleared for underwater deployment or not as successful use of the former type will require significantly more training.
