PinS concept for approaches can be summarized as follows: Then, if appropriate visual references are obtained, the pilot proceeds using visual references from the PinS to the FATO. This part of the operation is the visual flight phase; if appropriate visual references are not obtained, the pilot performs an instrument missed approach procedures. This operation is part of the instrument flight phase. Two types of PinS approach procedures are possible: PinS “proceed visually” approach - performed under IFR and relies on a published visual flight procedure. VMC not required; it is only required to see the heliport or landing location or visual references associated with it. PinS “proceed VFR” approach - performed under VFR and requires VMC.
