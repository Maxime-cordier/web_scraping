The Point-in-Space (PinS) concept is a flight operation based on GNSS and designed for helicopters only. It relies on the possibility for the pilot to conduct flight under Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) to/from a PinS and not directly to/from the heliport. Those procedures enable heliport or landing site operators to implement IFR procedures on non-instrument FATO (Final Approach and Take-Off) located on aerodromes or isolated heliports as well as landing locations. Another interest of the PinS concept is the flexibility to position the PinS in order to deal with heliports generally located in obstacle-rich environments (heliports on hospitals for instance). For approach, this flexibility allows a lower Obstacle Clearance Height (OCH) than with the direct procedure due to the position of the MAPt which can be located away from the FATO and makes the missed approach less critical regarding the obstacles. Two kinds of PinS operations are possible: PinS departure operations and PinS approach operations.
