Point-in-space (PinS) visual segment. This is the segment of a helicopter PinS approach procedure from the MAPt to the landing location for a PinS “proceed visually” procedure. This visual segment connects the Point-in-space (PinS) to the landing location. Descent point (DP). A point defined by track and distance from the MAPt to identify the point at which the helicopter may descend below the OCA/H on a visual descent to the heliport/landing location. Direct visual segment (Direct-VS). A visual segment designed as: a) a leg in a PinS approach, which may contain a single turn, from the MAPt direct to the heliport or landing location or via a descent point to the heliport or landing location; or b) a straight leg from the heliport or landing location to the IDF in a PinS departure. Height above surface (HAS). The difference in height between the OCA and the elevation of the highest terrain, water surface or obstacle within a radius of at least 1.5 km (0.8 NM) from the MAPt in a PinS “Proceed VFR” procedure. Minimum instrument meteorological conditions airspeed (Vmini). The minimum indicated airspeed at which a specific helicopter is certified to operate in instrument meteorological conditions. Missed approach point (MAPt). That point in an instrument approach procedure at or before which the prescribed missed approach procedure must be initiated in order to ensure that the minimum obstacle clearance is not infringed. Visual segment descent angle (VSDA). The angle between the MDA/H at the MAPt/DP and the heliport crossing height. Visual segment design gradient (VSDG). The gradient of the visual segment in a PinS departure procedure. The visual segment connects the heliport or landing location with the initial departure fix (IDF) minimum crossing altitude (MCA).
