VAST is the latest iteration of the International Helicopter Safety Team (IHST). Modeled after the U.S. Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST), the IHST was created in 2005 to reduce the helicopter accident rate. In 2019, the IHST transitioned to the International Helicopter Safety Foundation (IHSF). Two years later, in 2021, IHSF was rebranded as VAST to expand itâ€™s public-private efforts and enhance worldwide flight operational safety in all segments of the vertical flight industry.
