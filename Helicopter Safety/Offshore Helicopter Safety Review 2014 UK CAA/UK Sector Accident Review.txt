An internal UK CAA review of all UK offshore public transport helicopter reportable accidents during the period 1976 to 2012 had been initiated in response to an apparent decrease in the safety performance of offshore helicopter operations following a ditching in May 2012 (EC25, en-route, 20nm east of Aberdeen UK, 2012) and this was updated and used as a key part of the Review. During the more recent part of this period, 1992-2013, it was found that the combined data for both fatal and non fatal accidents showed that 28% could be attributed to both ‘technical’ and to ‘external’ causes with the remaining 44% attributed to ‘operational’ causes. The majority of the later were attributed to “pilot performance issues”, the overwhelming majority of ‘technical’ cause accidents to rotor and transmission failures and the overwhelming majority of ‘external’ cause accidents to lightning strikes (although lightning strikes were not the cause of any fatal accidents). A reduction in the technical cause rate accidents in the early 1990s was observed to have been “coincident and consistent with the introduction of Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS)”. The review compared the prevailing “mortality risk” for offshore helicopter occupants with that for passengers on commercial air transport flights in jet aircraft and noted that it was 10 times higher at 0.5 per million flights. Whilst noting the relatively more complex nature of twin turbine-powered helicopters and the relatively more hazardous offshore low level operating environment, the Report states that whilst any expectation that the level of safety of offshore helicopter operations might match that of jet transport operations is “unrealistic”…it is the view of the CAA that significant scope for improvement does exist and it is the aim of the actions and recommendations in this offshore review is to realise those improvements”.
