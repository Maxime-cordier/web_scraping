Whilst the Report is focused on the use of helicopters in support of oil and gas operations in the UK sector of the North Sea, it also looks in detail at practices in the rest of the North Sea, particularly the Norwegian sector. It is noted that 95% of European transport helicopters with more than 18 passenger seats (the SIKORSKY S-92, the EC225 and the AS332) are operated from the UK and Norway. The Review estimated that in 2013, the use of helicopters by the oil and gas industry in the UK and Norwegian Continental Shelf areas involved the respective use of 228/100 fixed helidecks and 50-100/20-40 mobile helidecks. In 2012, the UK area recorded over a million passenger journeys using a fleet of approximately 95 helicopters and the Norwegian area about 850,000 passenger journeys using a fleet if about 55 helicopters. The Review was based on “statistical analysis of reportable occurrences” and on an examination of relevant historical reports, studies and research which focused on the protection of passengers and crew and the operational and airworthiness issues raised by offshore operations in the UK North Sea. It was noted that the work on operations and airworthiness was founded on the identification of causal factors during this analysis, on previous UK sector reviews and safety studies and on a series of Studies carried out for offshore operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf by the Norwegian research organisation SINTEF, the most recently published of the latter being Helicopter Safety Study 3 in March 2010.
