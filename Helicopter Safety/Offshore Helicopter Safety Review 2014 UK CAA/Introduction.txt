In September 2013, the UK CAA decided to initiate a Review “to examine thoroughly the risks and hazards of operating in the North Sea and consider how these can be managed more effectively”. This Review was conducted “in conjunction with the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency so that a comparison could be made of any safety or operational differences”. The decision to undertake the review followed serious concerns in the wake of a fatal helicopter accident in the UK Offshore Sector the ditching of a Super Puma off Shetland in August 2013 which resulted in 4 fatalities and 3 serious injuries. The Terms of Reference adopted “required that it should study current operations, previous incidents and accidents and offshore helicopter flying in other countries in order to make recommendations aimed at improving the safety of offshore flying”. Whilst primarily directed at securing increased safety for routine offshore helicopter operations, this Review also has indirect relevance for offshore Search and Rescue (SAR) using helicopters. It is also likely to be of interest to other offshore oil and gas locations around the world, especially those in relatively hostile operating and survival environments.
