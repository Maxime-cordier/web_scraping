The recent issue of the EASA NPA on offshore helicopter operations in connection with current Rule Making Tasks RMT 0409/0410 which seek to address safety risks identified in such operations is acknowledged. This NPA envisages the introduction of a more stringent approval requirement in Annex V (Part-SPA) to Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012. The significance of two other current Rule Making Tasks, RMT.0120 (Ditching and Occupant Survivability) and RMT.0302/0515 (Helicopter Height/Velocity limitation), is also noted.
