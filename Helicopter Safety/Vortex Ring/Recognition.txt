Vortex ring gives similar symptoms in all helicopters but the severity may vary considerably from type to type. Indeed, modern rotor head design, particularly where there is an Active Vibration Damping System fitted, may reduce the symptoms of incipient vortex ring. Where the symptoms are noticeable they generally appear as follows: Incipient vortex ring conditions are typically: increased vibration and buffet, the onset of small amplitude ‘twitches’ in pitch and evidence of longitudinal, lateral and directional instability.. increased vibration and buffet,. the onset of small amplitude ‘twitches’ in pitch and evidence of longitudinal, lateral and directional instability.. Established vortex ring conditions are characterised by: a very rapid increase in rate of descent towards and beyond 3000fpm, reduced effectiveness of cyclic inputs in roll or pitch the application of collective pitch failing to arrest the rate of descent and usually increasing it.. a very rapid increase in rate of descent towards and beyond 3000fpm,. reduced effectiveness of cyclic inputs in roll or pitch. the application of collective pitch failing to arrest the rate of descent and usually increasing it..
