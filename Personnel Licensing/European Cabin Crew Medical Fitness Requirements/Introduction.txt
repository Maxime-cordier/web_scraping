The requirements for periodic attestation of the medical fitness of persons acting as cabin crew on commercial air transport flights introduced under EU-OPS 1.995 are superseded by the applicable part of the EASA Aircrew Regulation, IRs contained in Subpart C of Part-MED. Implementation is mandatory with effect from 8 April 2014. States may utilise transition arrangements after that date where permitted under the Regulation. An example of the latter is the UK, which has announced that all cabin crew must hold a valid EU medical report from 8 April 2019 but until that date, assessment of fitness for cabin crew duties under EU-OPS requirements will remain valid.
