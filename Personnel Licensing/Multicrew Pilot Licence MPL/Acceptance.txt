According to ICAO, all contracting States now recognise the MPL, even if they decide not to establish the MPL as a pilot license issued by their national aviation authorities. According to the International Air Transport Association’s IATA MPL Course Tracker worksheet as of 1 December 2018, the tracked reports show 3,433 MPL graduates, 5,711 MPL students, 90 captain upgrades and 39 approved training organisation (ATO) programs for airlines. The tracker also shows a mix of fewer than 24 airlines and training organisations submit reports to the tracker. ICAO survey data presented in 2014 show 26 States with MPLs in their national aviation regulations, and that 20 States had approved MPL programmes provided by an ATO. Among States that have adopted MPL into their regulations are Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Oman, Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. The MPL remains controversial. Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) in September 2019 said, “CASA is committed to the concepts underpinning the MPL and the need to find ways to evolve pilot training through the use of modern simulation technologies, better training practices and the further adoption of human factors and threat and error management.” While the Air Line Pilots Association, International, (ALPA) says on one of its websites, "For good reason, the MPL is not an available airline pilot training pathway in the United States, and ALPA opposes any effort for MPL to become a pathway.”
