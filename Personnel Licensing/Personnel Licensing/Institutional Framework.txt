The framework for licensing of all personnel is provided by Annex 1 “Personnel Licensing” to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, known as The Chicago Convention. Article 37 of the Convention deals with Personnel Licensing and authorises ICAO to adopt and amend as appropriate international Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) which for Personnel Licensing were first adopted in 1948. Since then, more than 170 amendments to Annex 1 have been adopted by the ICAO Council. Exceptionally, licensing of flight crew had been in existence prior to 1948 but until then had been carried out on the basis of national schemes which were not harmonised. ICAO SARPS are applicable to all applicants for, and holders of, licences, however, the assessment and examination of the knowledge, experience and proficiency of individual applicants for and holders of a licence, and the issue of the licence, is left to the discretion of Contracting States. Also, States may decide not to follow all ICAO SARPS in which case they are required to notify the differences to ICAO.
