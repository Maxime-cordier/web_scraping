In the majority of cases the right to exercise the privileges given by the licence requires that the licence holder meets certain appropriate medical requirements which are specified as three classes of medical assessment. The period of validity of the medical assessment may differ for the different licence types and is likely to differ according to the age of the holder as well. Any State, having issued a licence, must ensure that the privileges granted by it, or by attached ratings, are not exercised unless the holder maintains competency and meets the requirements for recent experience established by that State. To renew a licence, the holder must have exercised the privileges to specified minima during the period prior to intended renewal and/or pass appropriate proficiency examinations conducted by or under the authority of the licemce issuing authority.
