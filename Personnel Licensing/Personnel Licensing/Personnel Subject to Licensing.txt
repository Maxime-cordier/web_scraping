International SARPS are established for licensing the following personnel: Some States have decided to require licensing for other categories of personnel in their national regulatory scheme, such as Air Traffic Flow Managers, Flight Information Service Officers, Cabin Crew, etc. For example, in the United States, air carrier flight attendants are required to hold a Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency. Of note is that some States have decided not to licence Flight Dispatchers and other Flight Operations support staff. Military flight crews, air traffic controllers and aircraft engineering personnel operate in accordance with State requirements and military staff orders which are outwith the emit of ICAO Annex 1 and their qualifications are not interchangeable.
