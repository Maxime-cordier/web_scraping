In the United States, flight attendants, defined as individuals who work in the cabin of an aircraft that has 20 or more seats and is operated by a Federal Aviation Regulations Part 121 air carrier or Part 135 on-demand/charter operator, must hold a certificate of demonstrated proficiency issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The certificate is issued after an air carrier notifies FAA that an individual has successfully completed all the training requirements for flight attendants contained in the carrierâ€™s FAA-approved flight attendant training program.
