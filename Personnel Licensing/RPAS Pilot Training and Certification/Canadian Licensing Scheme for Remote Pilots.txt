Similar to CASA, Transport Canada’s current training and remote pilot licence standards for RPAS include a theoretical knowledge component and flight training–testing component for designated operations. These are published online in the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs, SOR/96-433) but operators/pilots also may obtain waivers by complying with the provisions of a special flight operations certificate–RPAS “if the applicant demonstrates to the Minister the ability to perform the operation without adversely affecting aviation safety or the safety of any person.” For remote pilots of small RPAs, Transport Canada introduced recency requirements that state: “No holder of a pilot certificate — small remotely piloted aircraft (VLOS) — basic operations or of a pilot certificate — small remotely piloted aircraft (VLOS) — advanced operations shall operate a remotely piloted aircraft system under this [CARs] Division unless the holder has, within the 24 months preceding the flight, been issued a pilot certificate [specified above]; or successfully completed either of the [specified] examinations [or a specified] flight review [or specified] recurrent training activities.” Remote pilots also must maintain a record of all flight operations activities for at least 24 months, and have the licence and recency record in their possession while operating an RPA. Advanced operations require the pilot to hold a Canadian pilot certificate — small remotely piloted aircraft (VLOS) — advanced operations. These operations are defined as flight in controlled airspace, minimum specified height and horizontal distance from uninvolved bystanders, within 3 nm from the centre of an airport, or within 1 nm mile from the centre of a heliport. The advanced-certificate requirements are successfully completing one of two knowledge examinations, a flight review and presenting documentation demonstrating that the pilot meets the recency requirements and evidence that the RPA brought to the flight review is properly registered. The flight review includes successfully performing pre-flight checks of their RPAS; performing a take-off; demonstrating the ability to navigate around obstacles; demonstrating the ability to recognize distances; and performing a landing.
