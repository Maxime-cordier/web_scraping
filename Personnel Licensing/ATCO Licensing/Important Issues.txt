Since ICAO Annex 1 was first published, there has been a significant increase in the volume of air traffic. Although Annex 1 has been amended, the basic licensing procedures, including the ratings, have remained unchanged. The increase in traffic, together with new technology, has led to more complex ATC procedures which in turn have required some ATCOs to become more specialised and to use more advanced controlling techniques.
