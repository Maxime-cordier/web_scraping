ATCO licences are the property of the licence holders, who are responsible for ensuring use of the licence in accordance with the privileges accorded by the licence. The holder may only provide the ATC services for which valid ratings are held and in accordance with the valid rating(s) and any associated rating and Unit endorsement(s) contained in the licence. Where any conditions are placed on the licence, for example the wearing of corrective spectacles, the licence holder is responsible for ensuring compliance with such restriction.
