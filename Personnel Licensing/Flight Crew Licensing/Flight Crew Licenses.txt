The ICAO licensing system detailed in Chapter 2 of Annex 1 covers the qualification for and issue of licences and ratings for pilots of aeroplanes and helicopters, giders, and free balloons. It also has provision in Chapter 3 for licences for flight engineers and flight navigators. Regulatory activities which are a direct consequence of FCL include: Approval of flight crew training provision. Approval of flight simulators and other synthetic training devices. Approval of arrangements for the certification of the medical fitness for flight crew. The particular case of medical fitness leads to the privileges of any flight crew licence being conditional upon the inclusion within it of evidence of valid certification of medical fitness.
