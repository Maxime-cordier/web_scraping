Having inherited an established a European FCL system from the former JAA which was implemented by each participating National Aviation Authority (NAA), the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was given, under Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 (also referred to as the EASA “Basic Regulation”), full legal responsibility for flight crew licensing in European Union States. EASA is able to rely upon the support of the NAAs in Member States acting as Qualified Entities to implement FCL. Initially, the JAA-FCL system has been continued almost entirely as inherited whilst EASA has consulted through the Notice of Proposed Action/Amendment (NPA) system on change proposals prior to introducing Implementng Rules. That consultation is now complete and is helping to provide the basis for the new Rules which will provide for future FCL in Europe. It is currently anticipated that these will comprise two sets of requirements, one covering FCL and the other covering medical certification for all persionnel licensing purposes. The requirements will be formulated so as to ensure compliance with Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and will take into account existing JAR-FCL 1, 2 and 3 requirements, existing requirements of individual Member States and ICAO Annex 1 Standards and Recommended Practices.
