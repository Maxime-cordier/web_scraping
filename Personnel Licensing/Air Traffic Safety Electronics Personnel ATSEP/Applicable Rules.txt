There is currently no provision in ICAO Annex 1, Personnel Licensing, for ATSEP to be issued with, or to hold, individual documents such as licences. However, there are provisions for the competency of such persons in the form of Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) published in ICAO Annex 10 and guidance material in ICAO Doc 7192 - AN/857 Part E2 - Training Manual for Air Traffic Safety Electronics Personnel (ATSEP). In addition, ICAO Doc 10057 provides guidance to ANSPs and training organisations on the development of ATSEP competency-based training and assessment programmes. EUROCONTROL has published safety regulatory requirements for implementation by member states. ESARR 5, which deals with ATM Personnel, contains specific requirements in ESARR 5 Section3 - Requirements for Engineering and Technical Personnel Undertaking Operational Safety Related Tasks, including in: The European Commission has issued Regulation No 1035/2011 (repealed in 2020 by Regulation 2017/373) laying down common requirements for the provision of air navigation services which, in its Annex II Section 3.3 sets out “Safety requirements for engineering and technical personnel undertaking operational safety related tasks”. These requirements transpose the equivalent requirements of ESARR 5 into European Community law and specify (inter alia): - “…With regard to the personnel involved in safety related tasks including personnel of subcontracted operating organisations, the provider of air traffic services shall document the adequacy of the competence of the personnel; the rostering arrangements in place to ensure sufficient capacity and continuity of service; the personnel qualification schemes and policy, the personnel training policy, training plans and records as well as arrangements for the supervision of non-qualified personnel…. …A provider of air traffic services shall maintain a register of information on the numbers, status and deployment of the personnel involved in safety related tasks. The register shall:(a) identify the accountable managers for safety related functions;(b) record the relevant qualifications of technical and operational personnel, against required skills and competence requirements;(c) specify the locations and duties to which technical and operational personnel are assigned, including any rostering methodology….”
