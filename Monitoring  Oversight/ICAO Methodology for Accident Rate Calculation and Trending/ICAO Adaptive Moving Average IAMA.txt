Moving averages are commonly used to filter out volatility which is contained in an indicator and allow identifying trends. However, due to the random component of the accident rate, simple 5-year moving averages are smoother but still do allow to decide whether a change is significant or not. ICAO has therefore chosen an adaptive moving average for the accident rate indicator. The ICAO Adaptive Moving Average (ICAO) becomes sensitive only during periods when the accident rate is moving in a certain direction and is insensitive to an accident rate movement when the accident rate is volatile. The IAMA is initially based on a 5-year simple moving average calculated at a given date. For the High Level Safety Conference in 2010, ICAO set this date to 1st of January 2005. At the beginning of each year, the IAMA is updated with the most recent 5-year simple moving average of the accident rate, provided that during the 2 last consecutive years: If at the beginning of the year, none of the 2 conditions above is met, the IAMA is not changed as accident rates exceeding the upper or lower bands during a single year are not considered to be significant. The IAMA is not a continuous curve like a line but a step-function. Each step indicates a significant change from one risk level to another one and allows easy tracking of significant changes. Figure 1 shows the control chart for the global world accident rate. The IAMA is constant. There has been one burst of the upper band in 2008 (%b=101.67) but the burst was not confirmed in 2009.
