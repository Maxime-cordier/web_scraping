The described methodology to calculate and trend accident rates can be applied to any other event counting safety indicator, either rated or not. One may for example count level busts in a given FIR and rate them by the number of aircraft handled during a given time period to create a level bust rate safety indicator using the defined methodology. Rating is not always necessary. If the number of exposure events like flights, landings etc. is fairly stable from one period to another, the raw number of events may be taken as safety indicator and controlled using this same methodology.
