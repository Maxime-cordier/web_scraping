A key feature of the ESIMS process is the development and implementation of Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) by States. CAPs address the deficiencies revealed in the audit process, and are incorporated into the final audit report, which also includes an evaluation of their effectiveness by SRU. The following graph is based on the reports received from 18 States previously audited under ESIMS, and shows the progress made in the implementation of corrective actions. The reports forwarded by States are based on their self-assessment, but the ESIMS process foresees the possibility of arranging follow up audits to double-check this aspect. Nevertheless, due to resource considerations, the Programme will confine itself to scheduling a limited number of follow-up audits by selecting a sample of two or three States per year. The first two follow-up audits will take place by the end of 2009.
