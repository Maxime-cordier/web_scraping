The following material is drawn from the article “The creation of an Aviation Safety Reporting Culture in Danish Air Traffic Control” by Peter Majgård Nørbjerg - Head of incident investigation, Naviair, Kastrup, Denmark. The Danish aviation reporting system is mandatory in the sense that air traffic personnel are obliged to submit reports of events, but is strictly non-punitive in the sense that they ensured indemnity against prosecution or disciplinary actions for any event they have reported. Furthermore, the reporting system is strictly confidential in the sense that the reporter’s identity may not be revealed outside the agency dealing with occurrence reports. Reporters of incidents are ensured immunity against any penal or disciplinary measure related to an incident if they submit a report of within 72 hours of its occurrence and providing it does not involve an accident, deliberate sabotage or negligence due to substance abuse. Punitive measures are stipulated against any breach of the guaranteed confidentiality.
