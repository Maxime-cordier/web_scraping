After the law was passed, the Danish aviation regulatory body, Statens Luftfartsv√¶sen, carried out the implementation of the regulatory framework. The regulatory authority subsequently issued instructions to the following groups: For these five categories of license holders it is now mandatory to follow the reporting system. Since both pilots and air traffic controllers now have to report occurrences within the reporting system, it is obvious that these two categories will sometimes be reporting situations basically created by the other. This will not incriminate either, as long as each professional abides by the obligation to report. This means that, for example, a situation created by air traffic control, reported by a pilot, will not incriminate the controller as long as the controller reports the same situation. In order to make it clear which situations these personnel are obliged to report, the regulatory authority issued guidance material to each of the five categories. Since the situations that could pose a threat to aviation are different for the five categories, each of the five categories has their own set of descriptions of the mandatory reportable situations.
