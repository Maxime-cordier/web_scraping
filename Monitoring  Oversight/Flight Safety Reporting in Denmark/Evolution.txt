In 2000, growing concerns about flight safety in Danish airspace were raised by the stakeholders in Danish aviation (service provider, regulator, and professional organisations). The concern was associated with losses of separation between aircraft that was not being reported due to the fear of sanctions of the reporter, particularly if he/she was partly or fully responsible for the incident. The whole aviation system in Denmark suffered from this, and no lessons were being learnt and disseminated from these events. As a consequence of the concern, the Transportation Subcommittee of the Danish Parliament asked representatives from the stakeholdersâ€™ organisations to explain their case to the Committee. This eventually led to the passing of a law in 2001 making non-punitive, strictly confidential reporting possible. It stands as is the only law in Denmark that guarantees immunity from prosecution when an otherwise punishable offence has been committed. The law grants freedom from prosecution, even though the reporter may have committed an erroneous act or omission that would normally be punishable. Furthermore the reports from this scheme are granted exemption from the provisions of the freedom of information act. Investigators are, by law, obliged to keep information from the reports undisclosed. However, the law grants no immunity if gross negligence or substance abuse is present in the reported situations, and it is also punishable by fine, not to report an incident in aviation.
