As a result of the investigations of the incoming reports, Naviair quickly realised that air traffic control cannot handle flight safety alone. Many potential hazardous situations between aircraft arise as a consequence of the interface between air traffic controllers and pilots (misuse of phraseology, different understanding of procedures, etc). Naviair therefore decided to establish a Flight Safety Forum, and invited flight safety officers from all the major Danish airlines to participate in discussion and knowledge sharing of flight safety relevant information. There has been wide acceptance of this approach and meetings are held twice a year to address operational flight safety in Danish airspace. Furthermore, it was decided to share the information used in incident investigation.
