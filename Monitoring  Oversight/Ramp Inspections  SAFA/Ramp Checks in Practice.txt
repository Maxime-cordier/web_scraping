Oversight authorities of the Member States engaged in the SAFA Programme choose which aircraft to inspect. Some authorities carry out random inspections while others try to target aircraft or airlines that they suspect may not comply with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards. In either case, only a very small proportion of third country aircraft operating into each State are inspected. Depending on the volume of third-country flights and the availability of inspectors in each Member State, the number of inspections may vary from relatively few to several hundred each year. Checks may include: A checklist of 54 inspection items is used during a SAFA Ramp Check. As the time between arrival and departure (the turn-around time) may not be sufficient to go through the full checklist, not all 54 items may be inspected. It is SAFA policy not to delay an aircraft except for safety reasons.
