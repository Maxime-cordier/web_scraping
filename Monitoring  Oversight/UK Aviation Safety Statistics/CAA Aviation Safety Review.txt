As a result, CAA SRG is able to periodically publish a review of civil aviation safety performance in the UK, European Union and worldwide. The most recent review was published in November 2008 as CAA Paper 780, which can be downloaded from the UK CAA website (see “Further Reading”). The objective of the safety review is to bring together aviation safety related information into a single source document to be used by the aviation community for statistical reference. Specifically, the document contains comprehensive statistics and analysis relating to (inter alia) : Worldwide Literature Review. Worldwide Aviation Safety. Aviation Safety in the European Union. Safety of UK Public Transport Worldwide. Safety of UK Non-public Transport Worldwide. Safety of UK Airspace and Aerodromes.
