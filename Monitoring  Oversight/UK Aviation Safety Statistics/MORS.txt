The objective of the MOR Scheme is to contribute to the improvement of air safety by ensuring that relevant information on safety is reported, collected, stored, protected and disseminated. The sole objective of occurrence reporting is the prevention of accidents and incidents and not to attribute blame or liability. By monitoring the safety performance of the aviation system, SRG can assess whether the safety risks are being properly controlled by the industry and public and can identify areas where safety may need to be improved. The SRG also makes use of other sources of information which allow it to assess risk for the whole aviation system. These can be world-wide accident and serious incident reports, information from the UK operational flight data monitoring programmes and data from special safety studies, all supported by comprehensive operational data. An explanation of the MORS is given in the CAA publication CAA Paper 382, which can be downloaded from the CAA website (see ‘Further Reading”).
