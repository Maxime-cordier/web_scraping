Over the course of the past few years, the EASA has become the main actor in safety investigation follow-up within Europe. This has also been reflected in the establishment of a robust and rigorous process for the safety recommendations received. Owing to EASAâ€™s central position in the aviation safety system, the Agency is able to take action with respect to systemic problems and the management of risk. The implementation of safety recommendations provides tangible improvements in safety as a result of the information that has been obtained during safety investigations. This methodical approach to investigatory work and the implementation of recommendations serves to ensure lessons are learned and help prevent future occurrences.
