Safety Investigation Authorities of different States address safety recommendations to EASA in the context of the Agency’s remit. The majority of these safety recommendations are related to procedures or regulations. The second most frequent category are related to aircraft or aviation-related equipment/facilities. The safety recommendations are classified by EASA in two major categories - Safety Recommendations of Union-wide Relevance (SRUR) and Safety Recommendations of Global Concern (SRGC). The handling of safety recommendations in both a swift and responsible manner constitutes one of EASA’s key responsibilities. The Agency assigns a high priority to the follow-up of safety recommendations and has established effective procedures to that effect: The Annual Safety Recommendations Review provides an overview of the follow-up performed by EASA in response to recommendations addressed to the Agency by Safety Investigation Authorities originating from the investigation of accidents and serious incidents or from safety studies. In addition, the review highlights a range of safety issues and Agency safety improvement efforts that are of interest to the European Aviation Community and the public.
