IOSA provides a common set of audit standards that are centrally managed, continuously updated, and consistently implemented by experts and industry professionals. IOSA standards are derived from all relevant ICAO standards, in particular Annexes 1, 6, and 8, as well as from regulations of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and industry best practices. The IOSA standards are based on eight areas that contribute to airline operational safety. These are: IOSA Standards are specified systems, policies, programs, processes, procedures, plans, sets of measures, facilities, components, types of equipment or any other aspect of operations under the scope of IOSA that are considered an operational necessity, and with which an operator will be expected to be in conformity at the conclusion of the Audit. During an audit, determination of nonconformity with specifications contained in an IOSA Standard results in a finding, which in turn results in the generation of a Corrective Action Report (CAR) by the Audit Organization (AO) that conducted the Audit. To close a finding, an operator will be required to respond with a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) that is acceptable to the AO, and then implement corrective action in accordance with the CAP. The implementation of corrective action will be verified by the AO.
