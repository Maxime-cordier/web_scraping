Improving the safety of the global air transport system is ICAO’s guiding and most fundamental Strategic Objective. The Organization works constantly to address and enhance global aviation safety outcomes through the following coordinated activities: In every case these activities are augmented by ICAO’s detailed appraisal of global aviation safety metrics on the basis of established risk management principles - a core tenet of contemporary State Safety Programmes (SSP) and Safety Management Systems (SMS). Applying these principles in the field of aviation safety requires the Organization to pursue a coherent and consistent process of objective analysis, both proactive and reactive as applicable, in particular when evaluating safety risks. The inaugural 2011 State of Global Aviation Safety Report is intended to provide a high-level analysis of air transport safety trends and indicators. It is also a comprehensive account of the significant aviation safety programmes being undertaken by ICAO and its partners, highlighting the Organization’s important leadership role in fostering increased cooperation and innovation to enhance air transport safety outcomes worldwide. Future ICAO Safety Reports will be published annually, providing ongoing updates to the air transport community on key safety indicators.
