EUROCONTROL implemented in 2007 a system for the collection of voluntary reports related to ATM called EUROCONTROL Voluntary ATM Incident Reporting (EVAIR) function. EVAIR collects and analyses voluntary reports submitted mainly by airlines and ANSPs with the objective to: Identify areas of safety concern;. Facilitate prompt communication between ANSPs and airlines enabling quick feedback at the operational level;. Assist in identifying and implementing timely solutions to operational safety problems at local, regional and ECAC level.. The added value of EVAIR for the aviation community is that, besides informing about accidents and serious incidents, it also provides information about low risk bearing incidents and supports the identification of early corrective actions.
