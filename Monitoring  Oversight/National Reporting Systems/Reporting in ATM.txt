In the ATM Sector, in the year 2000 EUROCONTROL approved ESARR 2 for implementation by Member States. Its provisions require States to: implement a formal means of safety occurrence reporting and assessment for all ATM-related occurrences that pose an actual or potential threat to flight safety, or can compromise the provision of safe ATM services, and. ensure that all appropriate safety data are collated and reported to EUROCONTROL in terms of high level safety indicators.. ESARR 2 also defines a list of ATM-related occurrences which shall, as a minimum, be reported and assessed by States, provides a ATM harmonised taxonomy for use by States, and defines the system of indicators for the reporting of occurrences to EUROCONTROL. The specific objectives of occurrence reporting in ATM are to: Assess ATM safety performance and related trends over time;. Identify key risk areas where the ATM system could contribute to safety improvement, and to take appropriate actions;. Investigate, assess and draw conclusions on the extent of the ATM system contribution to the cause of all types of safety occurrences and to take corrective measures, whether regulatory or not;. Draw conclusions on how the ATM system could improve safety even in areas where it is not involved in accidents or incidents, and. Assess and monitor over time whether technical and operational changes introduced to the ATM system meet their predetermined safety requirements, and take appropriate actions..
