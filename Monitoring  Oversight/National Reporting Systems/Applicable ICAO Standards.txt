Contracting States of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) have agreed in Annex 13, Aircraft Accident Investigation, to the Chicago Convention that States shall investigate all accidents to aircraft within their territorial limits, and “…shall report to ICAO information on all aircraft accidents which involve aircraft of a maximum certificated take-off mass of over 2 250 kg”. In addition, “…a State shall establish a mandatory incident reporting system to facilitate collection of information on actual or potential safety deficiencies”. Further, it is recommended that “a State should establish a voluntary incident reporting system to facilitate the collection of information that may not be captured by a mandatory incident reporting system. A voluntary incident reporting system shall be non-punitive and afford protection to the sources of the information”. In addition, it is required that “…a State having established an accident and incident database and an incident reporting system shall analyse the information contained in its accident/incident reports and the database to determine any preventive actions required”. The requirements for national reporting systems are therefore clear, and accompanied by a further requirement to establish an analysis capability to maximise the safety benefit from lessons learned from occurrences and their investigation.
