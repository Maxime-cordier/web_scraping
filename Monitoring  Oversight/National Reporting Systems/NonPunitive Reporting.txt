A feature of all the above international provisions is that they are accompanied by a requirement for all reporting to be non-punitive. In this context, both ICAO Annex 13 and Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 explicitly state: In practice, it is now widely accepted that no system can, or should, be completely free of all blame. Situations involving gross negligence, wilful wrong-doing or criminal acts should be dealt with by appropriate penalties being applied to the individuals concerned. However, a line must be drawn between those situations and occurrences in which professionals are acting in good intent and within the limits of their capabilities - i.e. genuine slips, lapses and errors. It is equally accepted that it is crucial to get this balance right. If not, the inappropriate handling of such cases can be vastly detrimental to the viability of national reporting systems.
