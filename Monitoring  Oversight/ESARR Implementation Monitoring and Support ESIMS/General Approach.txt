The ESIMS Programme relies on the conduct of safety oversight audits to individual States. The conduct of the safety oversight audits is organised around two phases: States are asked to develop a corrective action plan, within an agreed period, to resolve any unfavourable findings. The implementation of the action plan is monitored by EUROCONTROL through follow-up activities. The States that participated in the ESIMS Programme are the EUROCONTROL Member States and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Member States who are not members of EUROCONTROL and who have agreed to participate in the ESIMS Programme.
