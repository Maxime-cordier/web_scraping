The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) describes its Integrated Oversight Philosophy as “the core set of principles for evolving the FAA’s safety oversight systems” and that it is part of the agency’s “culture shift to be proactive and collaborative in using safety management principles to address risk.” FAA Order 8000.72, effective 28 June 2017, says that implementation of these principles is key to supporting the FAA Risk-Based Decision Making (RBDM) Strategic Initiative and “ensuring that the FAA meets the challenges of a rapidly evolving U.S. aerospace system.” The policy supports the RBDM initiative by leveraging the use of consistent, data-informed approaches to enable FAA “to make smarter, system-level, risk-based decision.”
