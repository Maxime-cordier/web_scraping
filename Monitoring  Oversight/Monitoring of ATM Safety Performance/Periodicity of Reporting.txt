The monitoring of safety performance should be a non-stop activity. Information gathered within the monitoring process must be comprehensive and timely enabling appropriate action to be taken in a timescale, and with sufficient responsiveness, that the safety performance of the ATM system is not impaired or threatened. However, there is a further need to publish the results of safety performance monitoring for the benefit of those who may not be close to the management and decision-making processes, but nevertheless seek appropriate assurance on the current state and trends of the indicators and/or metrics being tracked. The need for such information determines timing of publication, but it is common for States and major organisations who publish safety reports containing ATM safety performance information and data, to do so on an annual basis.
