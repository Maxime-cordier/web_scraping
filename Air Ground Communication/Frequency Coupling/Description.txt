Frequency coupling is a method for air-ground voice communication in which more than one frequency is used but stations using one of the frequencies can receive messages sent on the other(s). Sometimes it is necessary for a single ATS sector or unit to use more than one frequency simultaneously. Examples of such situations include: The benefit of using two frequencies simultaneously is that there is no need to instruct pilots to make frequency changes in the above situations. This reduces communicaiton workload. Additionally, the risk of loss of communication is reduced as frequency changes are known to be a major contributor to such occurrences. There are two basic methods to use multiple frequencies simultaneously: CopyrightSKYbrary
