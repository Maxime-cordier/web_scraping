Several scenarios have been identified as related to the occurrence of simultaneous radio transmissions: Scenario 1: Two pilots transmitting simultaneously Scenario 2: Simultaneous transmissions by the ATCO and a pilot (also known as “stepped on transmission”): Scenario 3: “Multi-receiver Blindspot” is another source of loss of signal (or transmission) which could also be considered in the context of Undetected Simultaneous Transmissions. It corresponds to wide range radio field operations used in difficult terrain leading to lack of reception for some pilots and to the signal being lost. Either of these scenarios or any combination of them could result in the occurrence of Undetected Simultaneous Transmission (USiT).
