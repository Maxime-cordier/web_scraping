Several scenarios have been identified as related to the occurrence of simultaneous radio transmissions: Scenario 1: Two pilots transmitting simultaneously on the same frequency with one ground receiver (also known as “stepped on transmission”). on the same frequency with two or more ground receivers being connected to a “Best Signal Selection” (BSS) system (also known as “call swamping”). on 2 frequencies that are cross-coupled by the controller (also known as “call-blocking”). Scenario 2: Simultaneous transmissions by the ATCO and a pilot (also known as “stepped on transmission”): on a single frequency. on frequencies that are in a cross-coupled group at the CWP; (the pilot makes a transmission on a coupled frequency while the Controller is transmitting to frequencies in the cross-coupled group).. Scenario 3: “Multi-receiver Blindspot” is another source of loss of signal (or transmission) which could also be considered in the context of Undetected Simultaneous Transmissions. It corresponds to wide range radio field operations used in difficult terrain leading to lack of reception for some pilots and to the signal being lost. Either of these scenarios or any combination of them could result in the occurrence of Undetected Simultaneous Transmission (USiT).
