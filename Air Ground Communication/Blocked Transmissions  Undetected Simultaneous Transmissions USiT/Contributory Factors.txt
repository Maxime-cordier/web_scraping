The following parameters or factors are linked to the phenomenon, either as contributors or as a ‘inherent’ system characteristics: Similar Sounding Callsigns (callsigns confusion) – Use of very similar callsigns leading to limited/no detection by the ATCO. Expectation Bias – The pilot or ATCO has a strong belief/mindset towards a particular outcome and therefore misjudges the aural information. R/T discipline (e.g.: a/c calling “too” early on a given frequency, pilot not monitoring the R/T exchange on the frequency and “cutting” the transmission exchange). Traffic load and frequency use – increased workload and breakdown of performance in terms of detecting USiT. Use of frequency coupling - frequency coupling during collapsing/grouping of sectors (single sector operation). Frequency conditioning - The high quality of current frequency conditioning by the transmitters is responsible for the accurate compliance of the generated signal. Hence, no audible feedback (voice-over) is generated during simultaneous transmissions. (improved transmitters accuracy). Elimination of the weaker signal – amplitude modulation (AM) receivers eliminate a second weaker signal at the output because of their technical features.. Distance factor - Significant differences of the received signals due to long distances. Equipment factor - Significant differences of the received signals due to aircraft equipment. Areas with wide coverage to deal with or condition of environment and landscape (mountains, valleys). Super refractions leading to reception of calls using the same frequency in another (far away) area (incl. propagation). Use of several receivers to cover a wide sector.
