The Aeronautical Mobile Satellite (Route) Service, more commonly referred to as SATVOICE, can be used as a supplement to HF and CPDLC. The necessary phone numbers (of both radio stations and ACCs) can be found in the State AIPs. Since oceanic traffic typically communicates with ATC through radio facilities, routine SATVOICE calls should be made to such a facility rather than the ACC. Only when the urgency of the communication dictates otherwise should SATVOICE calls be made to the ACC. Note that HF propagation difficulties do not constitute urgency. The use of SATVOICE is described in ICAO Doc 7030 (Regional Supplementary Procedures). The provisions include that even when using SATVOICE, flight crews must simultaneously operate SELCAL or maintain a continuous watch on the assigned frequency.
