Flight crews must maintain a continuous watch on the assigned frequency unless SELCAL equipped. In this case they should follow the following procedures: Complying with these procedures is important even when SATVOICE or CPDLC are being used for routine air-ground communications as this ensures that ATC has a timely means of contacting the aircraft. SELCAL code assignment is predicated on the usual geographical area of operation of the aircraft. Therefore, in order to avoid duplication issues, the operator should contact the SELCAL Registrar and request an appropriate SELCAL code if flying beyond the area of normal operations.
