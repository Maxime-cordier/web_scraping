The frequency 124.450 MHz has been established for world-wide use when aircraft are out of range of VHF ground stations. It is intended for pilot-to-pilot exchanges of operationally significant information and is not to be used as a "chat" frequency. In case of air-ground communicaions failure, 123.450 MHz may be used to relay position reports via another aircraft. The inter-pilot frequency (123.450 MHz) may also be used by flight crews to contact other aircraft when needing to coordinate offsets required in the application of the Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP). The emergency frequency (121.5 MHz) should be continuously monitored by all aircraft so as to be prepared to offer assistance to any other aircraft advising an emergency situation. If necessary, initial contact for relays or offset coordination can be established on 121.5 MHz. Note that great care must be exercised in such cases as this frequency could be used by aircraft experiencing or assisting with an ongoing emergency. In order to minimise unnecessary use of 121.5 MHz, it is recommended that when possible aircraft additionally monitor 123.450 MHz.
