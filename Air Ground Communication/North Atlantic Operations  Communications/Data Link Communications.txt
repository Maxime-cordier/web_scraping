Data link communications are used for position reporting (via ADS-C and CPDLC) and ATC communications using FANS 1/A CPDLC. CPDLC provides communication redundancy and controllers will in many cases use it even though the flight crew is maintaining a continuous watch on a direct controller-pilot VHF frequency. ADS-C furthermore enables ATC to perform route conformance monitoring for downstream waypoints. The aircraft data link system provides indication of any degraded performance which results from a failure or loss of connectivity. The flight crew should then notify the ATS unit as soon as practicable. Timely notification is essential to ensure that the ATS unit has time to assess the situation and apply a revised separation standard, if necessary. Similar to SATVOICE usage, flight crews electing to use Data link communications remain responsible for operating SELCAL, or maintaining a continuous on the assigned HF frequency. Flights equipped with CPDLC and/or ADS-C should ensure that they are logged on to the appropriate oceanic ACC. This applies even when the aircraft is provided with ATS Surveillance services. With the introduction of PBCS separation, establishing and maintaining a data link connection becomes even more important since an active data link connection is one of the requirements for the application of the separation.
