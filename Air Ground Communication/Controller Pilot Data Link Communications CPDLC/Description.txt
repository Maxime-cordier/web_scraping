CPDLC is a two-way data-link system by which controllers can transmit non urgent 'strategic messages to an aircraft as an alternative to voice communications. The message is displayed on a flight deck visual display. The CPDLC application provides air-ground data communication for the ATC service. It enables a number of data link services (DLS) that provide for the exchange of communication management and clearance/information/request messages which correspond to voice phraseology employed by air traffic control procedures. The controllers are provided with the capability to issue ATC clearances (level assignments, lateral deviations/vectoring, speed assignments, etc), radio frequency assignments, and various requests for information. The pilots are provided with the capability to respond to messages, to request/receive clearances and information, and to report information. A “free text” capability is also provided to exchange information not conforming to defined formats. The CPDLC is being globally implemented and currently is in different implementation stages. The global communication procedures are detailed in the ICAO Provisions: Annex 10 Volume III Part 1 Chapter 3. The CPDLC message set is contained in ICAO Doc 4444: PANS-ATM, Annex 5. The implementation of CPDLC for the European airspace users operating above FL285 and ANSPs is addressed in the Data Link Services Implementing Rule.
