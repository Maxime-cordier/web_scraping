The following underlying principles are applicable to the use of CPDLC: Voice and data link shall co-exist as a means of ATS communication. Implementation of CPDLC is intended as a supplementary means of communication to the use of voice communication.. CPDLC shall only be used in the context of non-time-critical communications. Time-criticality is mainly determined by the following factors: ATC traffic situation, end-to-end performance (systems and flight crew/controller response time) and recovery time. Users should be aware that while a voice response is generally expected in a few seconds the latency of CPDLC is usually much longer (up to several minutes).. The decision to use either voice or CPDLC shall be at the discretion of the controller and/or pilot involved.. The provisions regarding the use of CPDLC shall respect the following standard as provided in ICAO Annex 11, Chapter 3, par. 3.5.1: “A controlled flight shall be under the control of only one air traffic control unit at any given time”..
