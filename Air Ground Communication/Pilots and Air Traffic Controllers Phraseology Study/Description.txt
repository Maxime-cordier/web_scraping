The International Air Transport Association (IATA), together with the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations (IFALPA) and the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers’ Associations (IFATCA), jointly prepared an on-line survey regarding communication issues, focusing on the non-use of ICAO standard phraseology. Separate surveys for both airline Pilots and Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) were prepared to collate the lessons learned and identify potential safety recommendations in the area of communications. This Report "Pilots and Air Traffic Controllers Phraseology Study" is the outcome of these surveys. The use of “Aviation English” was explicitly excluded from the survey as this issue has been managed through other venues. The survey was designed to identify areas where established phraseology, or local phraseology, has been, or has the potential, to be misunderstood.
