Cost â€“ Preparation and publication costs for the various guides. The UK has produced a number of VFR guides for flying near or through complicated parts of controlled and uncontrolled airspace. Some of these guides show aerial photographs of the Visual Reporting Points (VRPs), others have guidance from local controllers on the best crossing points and the most recent is a series of DVDs showing recommended routes for helicopters in the Heathrow Control Zone and the best routes outside CAS below the London TMA. The ANSP has also worked closely with a number of aviation event organisers to produce detailed guidance for visiting pilots, leading to significant reductions in the number of infringements associated with those events.
