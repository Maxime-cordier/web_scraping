Background: CPDLC allows the planner help the executive by performing certain tasks. Safety issue(s): In case of miscommunication between the two controllers (e.g. due to high workload), a situation can occur where the executive controller is not fully aware of the situation and makes decisions based on wrong assumptions. Typical scenarios The planner sends a clearance message to an aircraft to help the executive solve a conflict in a busy traffic situation. The executive however has spotted the conflict and has come up with a different plan. The two plans mismatch and a corrective action becomes necessary.. A variation of the above scenario: the planner responds to a pilotâ€™s request.. The planner initiates a procedure for frequency change prematurely. The executive cannot to issue a last-moment clearance and, depending on the circumstances, a loss of separation at sector boundaries might occur.. Defences Organisational: Precise definition of task distribution in the ATC Manual of Operations.. As a controller: The planner should coordinate with the executive controller prior to sending a message or, if that is not practical, inform them immediately after it is sent..
