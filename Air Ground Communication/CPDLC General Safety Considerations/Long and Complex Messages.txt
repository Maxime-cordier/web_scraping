Background: CPDLC allows controllers and pilots to send long and complex messages. The good thing is that the other party no longer needs to memorize the request/clearance and confusion is less likely (e.g. “Turn left heading 340, climb FL320” is very difficult to be interpreted as “Turn left heading 320, climb FL340”). Safety issue(s): If a clearance (request) can only be partially complied with (fulfilled), the reply will be “unable” and it will address the entire message. This will result in a higher workload. Also, long and complex messages are more likely to cause ambiguity. Defences: The use of complex messages (even if allowed by the system) should be avoided in general.
