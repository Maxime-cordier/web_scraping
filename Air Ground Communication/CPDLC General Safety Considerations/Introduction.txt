This article describes the safety issues related to and use of Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC). While CPDLC is expected to contribute to an improved safety of flight operations there are some issues that could lead to safety occurrences unless properly addressed. The main objective of the article is to identify some best practices for CPDLC users (both pilots and controllers) and provide ideas for mitigation actions to be taken if safety is threatened.
