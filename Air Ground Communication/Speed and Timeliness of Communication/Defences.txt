Transmissions must be conducted concisely in a normal conversational tone; full use must be made of standard phraseologies wherever these are prescribed in relevant ICAO documents or procedures. Speech transmitting technique should be such that the highest possible intelligibility is incorporated in each transmission. Fulfilment of this aim requires that air crew and ground personnel should: a) enunciate each word clearly and distinctly; b) maintain an even rate of speech not exceeding 100 words per minute. When a message is transmitted to an aircraft and its contents may need to be written down, the speaking rate should be slightly slower to allow for that action. A slight pause preceding and following numerals makes them easier to understand; c) maintain the speaking volume at a constant level; d) be familiar with microphone operating techniques particularly in relation to the maintenance of a constant distance from the microphone if a modulator with a constant level is not used; e) suspend speech temporarily if it becomes necessary to turn the head away from the microphone. Speech transmission technique should be adapted to the prevailing communications conditions. (ICAO Annex 10, Volume II, Chapter 5 Para 5.2.1.)
