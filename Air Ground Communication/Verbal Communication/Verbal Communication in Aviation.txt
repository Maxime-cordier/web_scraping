Despite the increased use of hand-held and integrated data-link communication and computer interfaces that use non-verbal inputs, verbal communication remains a vital part of ensuring aviation safety. This is not just between air traffic control and pilots, but between a complex team of players including ramp workers, ground-handlers, cabin crew, aerodrome operators, construction workers, airline staff, security, other specialists and members of the public. Not all verbal communication occurs face-to-face; indeed, in aviation much verbal communication (perhaps the most critical) occurs remotely via radio systems. For example, post events of 11 September 2001 in New York, the mandatory use of reinforced flight deck doors has also relegated more communications between cabin crew and pilots to the intercom system, thereby removing visual cues and the possibility of written communication. Remote communication is distinct from face-to-face interpersonal communication where, for instance, eyesight and body language feature quite highly to either enhance or confuse[1]. However, in some situations, modern technology is being used to enhance, and sometimes replace, verbal communication i.e. Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC), and message boards at de-icing facilities. The Internationally accepted language for aviation is English and pilots and air traffic controllers now have to meet English Language Proficiency Requirements established by ICAO. Furthermore, some States (including EASA) require a common language be in use for communication within the aircraft cabin and between the cabin and flight deck.
