It takes more than one person to communicate: the meaning of any communication is the response you get[5]. Ultimately the receiver’s reaction must be monitored for feedback to the transmitter. In aviation scenarios it is expected that both parties have an understanding of the importance of effective communication and both will adopt the responsibility to ensure that the communication is effective; although never assume this! The transmitter must: know what they want to communicate (i.e. know what response they want from the intended receiver),. be clear (use their manner of speech objectively and subjectively to make it so), and. test understanding (either by direct observable feedback, or through questioning).. The receiver must: “actively” listen,. test meaning, and. demonstrate their understanding..
