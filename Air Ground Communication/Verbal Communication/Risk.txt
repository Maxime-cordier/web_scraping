The risk presented by ineffective verbal communication is relatively high. Consequences can be severe, and the frequency with which communication errors are referenced as causal factors in accidents, incidents and occurrences is substantial. When air-ground verbal communications go wrong, then the consequences can be serious: e.g. loss of separation, altitude deviation, or, runway incursion. Similar consequences can occur when they go wrong on the Ramp: e.g. incorrect loading of cargo; failure to electrically “ground” or “bond” aircraft and refuelling vehicle; or, unsafe approach to rotating engine/propeller. Annually there are around 240,000 injuries on the Ramp and over $5 billion worth of damage[2] A pilot failing to communicate a need to “go-around”, or a cabin crewmember failing to describe the severity of ice contamination on a wing can lead to catastrophe. Make a search of NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) for human factors occurrences on the Ramp, and it will show that 37% of occurrences involve communication breakdown. Analysis of level bust events, within Europe, occurring in the first half of 2005 showed that four out of the top five causal factors involved a breakdown in communications, including incorrect read-back by the correct aircraft and pilot read-back by the incorrect aircraft, which is often the result of call sign confusion[3]. One of the reasons why poor communication is cited as a causal factor in occurrences is the vast number of other factors that directly impact on the quality and frequency of communication. The diagram below lists only the factors that affect air-ground radio communications, but many are relevant for all types of verbal communication[4].
