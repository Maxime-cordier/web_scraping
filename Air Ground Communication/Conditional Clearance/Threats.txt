A danger of misunderstanding, ambiguity or other confusion could exist in a conditional clearance, for example: the pilot might follow the wrong aircraft. To reduce the risk of such confusion ICAO specifies that: Conditional phrases, such as “behind landing aircraft” or “after departing aircraft”, shall not be used for movements affecting the active runway(s), except when the aircraft or vehicles concerned are seen by the appropriate controller and pilot. The aircraft or vehicle causing the condition in the clearance issued shall be the first aircraft/vehicle to pass in front of the other aircraft concerned.
