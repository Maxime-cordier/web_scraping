ICAO also specifies the precise format of a conditional clearance: In all cases a conditional clearance shall be given in the following order and consist of: a) identification; b) the condition; c) the clearance; and d) brief reiteration of the condition, for example: “SAS 941, BEHIND DC9 ON SHORT FINAL, LINE UP BEHIND”. Note.— This implies the need for the aircraft receiving the conditional clearance to identify the aircraft or vehicle causing the conditional clearance. (ICAO Doc 4444 - PANS-ATM: Chapter 12, para 12.2.7)
