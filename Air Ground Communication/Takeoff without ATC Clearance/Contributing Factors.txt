Call sign confusion (i.e., the flight crew of one aircraft taking a clearance intended for another one) - This is more likely to happen at complex aerodromes with more than one runway.. Incorrect phraseology - The most notorious example of this is the use of the word take-off in a phrase not related to a take-off clearance but instead to a different type of ATC clearance; see (the B742 / B741, Tenerife Canary Islands Spain, 1977 accident). A distorted ATC message containing the word "take off" can easily be misinterpreted as a takeoff clearance.. Expectation bias - For example, the instruction "for departure contact tower" issued by the GND controller might be misinterpreted as "after departure contact tower." This was the case in the B738, Eindhoven Netherlands, 2012 occurrence.. Cockpit workload - The pre-takeoff part of the flight is a time of high workload for pilots, and there is risk that they will fail to notice the absence of a clearance or "will assume" that their take-off clearance has been issued..
