Taking off without ATC clearance may lead to: Runway Incursion - The aircraft may have been cleared only to the runway holding point. Also, at relatively complex aerodromes, taking off may mean crossing other runways.. Rejected Take Off - The tower controller would likely observe the aircraft starting the take-off roll and may instruct the crew to cancel it.. Loss of Separation - If the take-off without clearance is not aborted, either because of lack of communication or due to the pilots non-compliance with the instruction (e.g. for safety reasons), there is a chance that the aircraft that has just taken off will come into close proximity with other traffic in the vicinity of the aerodrome.. Aborted landing(s) for aircraft on final. This may happen as a consequence of a runway incursion.. Increased workloads for controllers and pilots due to the sudden change of plan. At busier aerodromes, several aircraft may need to be given avoiding-action instructions or other clearance amendments (e.g. orbits/holding patterns)..
