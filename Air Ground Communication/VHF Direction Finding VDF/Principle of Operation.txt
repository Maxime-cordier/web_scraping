The receiving antenna of a VDF consists of several (3 or more) elements mounted around a pole. CopyrightCreated by SKYbrary author Each element receives the same signal but at a slightly different time (i.e. they receive different phases at the same time). This allows the system to calculate the direcion from which the signal has been received. An example of an antenna with three elements is shown below: CopyrightCreated by SKYbrary author The explanation below illustrates the priciple of how phase (time) difference of the received signal helps to determine the direction of the transmitting station. The dotted lines consist of equidistant point in relation to each of the elements. Thus, the space is divided into six areas. The signal is received by element 1 first, then by element 2 and finaly by element 3, this means that: The only area that fulfills all three conditions is area II, hence the aircraft is east of the VDF. Real systems take into account the precise phase (time) differences, which allows them to calculate the bearing of the signal rather than just the general direction. Depending on the particular implementation (e.g. number of antenna elements), the accuracy of bearing determination may vary. ICAO classifies the accuracy as follows: Similarly, the classification of estimated position accuracy (when an array of VDFs is used) is made in accordance with the following:
