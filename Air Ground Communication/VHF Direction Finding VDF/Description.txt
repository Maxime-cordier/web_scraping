The VHF direction finder (VDF) is a ground based radio aid that consists of a directional antenna system and a VHF radio receiver, tuned to the operating frequency of an air traffic services unit. Thus, when a transmission is received from an aircraft, the VDF provides the direction that transmission came from (i.e. azimuth relative to the receiver). VDF stations may operate independently or as an array. In the former case, they only provide the direction of the transmitting station. When two or more VDFs operate together, they can provide position information. This is done by calculating the intersection point of the bearings obtained from the different receivers. The direction finding principle of operation is not limited to the use of VHF. For example, the UDF (UHF direction finder) operates on UHF frequencies that are used by state aircraft. An example of a standalone VDF equipment is shown on the picture below: CopyrightCreated by SKYbrary author An example of VDF equipment integrated into the ATS system is shown on the picture below. The circle shows the estimated location of the received radio transmission. CopyrightCreated by SKYbrary author The controller receives a call from IVB3011. This traffic was not supposed to be on the frequency, hence it is represented in a dull (dark grey) colour on the situation display. However, as the green circle indicates the approximate position of the transmitting station, the controller's attention is drawn to a specific, small part of the airspace and they can therefore easily assess the situation and take appropriate action.
