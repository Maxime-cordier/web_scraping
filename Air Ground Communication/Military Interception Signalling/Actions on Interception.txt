The flight crew of an intercepted aircraft should follow the instructions given by the interceptor, interpreting and responding to the visual signals (see the paragraph on Interception signals below). The flight crew should notify the appropriate ATC unit and attempt to establish radio communication with the interceptor on 243.0 MHz or 121.5 MHz, giving the identity and position of the aircraft and the nature of the flight. The flight crew should then Squawk emergency (7700) unless otherwise instructed. If the intercepted aircraft receives intructions from any source which conflict with the instructions given by the intercepting aircraft, they should seek clarification but continue to comply with the instructions given by the intercepting aircraft.
