Day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) If there are two intercepting aircraft, the second will usually adopt a surveillance position while the lead aircraft moves in closer to positively identify the aircraft and the status of its flight crew. Separation should not be less than the minimum necessary to identify aircraft and flight crew status. If the interceptors are not equipped with altitude encoding transponders or have switched them off, then the first awareness of interception may come from passengers via the cabin crew. The interceptor aircraft can be expected to be careful not to alarm the crew and passengers and will manoeuvre slowly and deliberately. The lead aircraft of two can be expected to adopt a position slightly ahead, higher and to the left of the intercepted aircraft. Night and Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) In IMC or at night, the intercepting aircraft can be expected to establish themselves in a radar trail comfortably behind the intercepted aircraft and will maintain a safe vertical separation.
