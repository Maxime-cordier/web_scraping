The standard instrument departure (SID) specifies a climb to 5,000 ft. The pilot is cleared to 4,000 ft. The pilot correctly reads back the clearance but climbs to 5,000 ft (Level Bust).. The pilot is normally cleared to follow a specific taxi route to the stand, which involves no stops. The ATCO clears the pilot to taxi by a different route and instructs him/her to wait at a particular point. The pilot fails to stop at the specified point..
