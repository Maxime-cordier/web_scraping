The aircraft shall comply with the voice communication failure procedures of Annex 10, Volume II, and with those of the following procedures as are appropriate. The aircraft shall attempt to establish communications with the appropriate air traffic control unit using all other available means. In addition, the aircraft, when forming part of the aerodrome traffic at a controlled aerodrome, shall keep a watch for such instructions as may be issued by visual signals. An aircraft equipped with an SSR transponder is expected to operate the transponder on Mode A Code 7600 to indicate that it has experienced air-ground communication failure. An ADS-B equipped aircraft experiencing radio communication failure may transmit the appropriate ADS-B emergency and/or urgency mode. An aircraft equipped with other surveillance system transmitters, including ADS-C, might indicate the loss of air-ground communication by all of the available means. If the aircraft fails to indicate that it is able to receive and acknowledge transmissions, separation shall be maintained between the aircraft having the communication failure and other aircraft, based on the assumption that the aircraft will: i) The time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached; or ii) Time the transponder is set to Code 7600 or the ADS-B transmitter is set to indicate the loss of air-ground communications; or iii) The aircraftâ€™s failure to report its position over a compulsory reporting point; whichever is later and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan; A note concerning departing aircraft experiencing RCF: If the aircraft has been vectored away from the route specified in the flight plan then the flight crew is expected to comply with the procedures published in the appropriate regional air navigation agreement and included in the SID description or published in the AIP.
