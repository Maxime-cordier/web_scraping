The use of similar call signs by aircraft operating in the same area and especially on the same RTF frequency often gives rise to potential and actual flight safety incidents. This hazard is usually referred to as “call sign confusion”. The following are some examples of the more common causes for call sign confusion: Airlines allocate commercial flight numbers as call-signs; these are normally consecutive and therefore similar (e.g. RUSHAIR 1431, RUSHAIR 1432, etc.). Airlines schedule flights with similar call signs to be in the same airspace at the same time.. Call signs coincidentally contain the same alphanumeric characters in a different order (e.g. AB1234 and BA 2314).. Call signs contain repeated digits (e.g. RUSHAIR 555).. Alpha-numeric call signs end in two letters which correspond to the last two letters of the destination’s ICAO location indicator (e.g. RUSHAIR 25LL for a flight inbound to London Heathrow);.
