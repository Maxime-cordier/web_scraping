ELPAC tests English language proficiency at ICAO level 4. (operational) and level 5 (extended)[2] Both standard ICAO phraseology and plain language are included in the test. Plain language proficiency is an essential component of radiotelephony communications, as it is not possible to develop standard phraseologies to cover every conceivable situation. There are currently two versions of ELPAC available, which were designed specifically to reflect the communicative functions of air traffic controllers and commercial pilots. There are two papers, and candidates are required to successfully complete both: ELPAC Paper 1 is administered via the Internet and takes around 40 minutes to complete. ELPAC Paper 2 is administered by two ELPAC examiners, a language expert and an operational expert, and takes around 20 minutes to complete.
