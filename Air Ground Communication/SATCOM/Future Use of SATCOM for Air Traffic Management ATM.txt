Most agencies consider that SATCOM capability will eventually form a more significant part of the ATC element of the ATN system, since it is probably the only way to ensure reliable data link coverage of oceanic and remote continental environments at the capacity levels required and may also eventually be required due to voice and data communication capacity constraints in parts of Europe and the USA. Current ATM SATCOM for en route ATM uses satellites and a radio frequency spectrum shared with ACARS and other communication channels rather than the dedicated ones which would be possible if the system was ultimately to be applied more widely. ICAO Annex 10 currently notes that â€œITU Radio Regulations permit systems providing mobile-satellite service to use the same spectrum as Aeronautical Satellite (route) Service without requiring such systems to offer safety services and that this situation has the potential to reduce the available spectrum ATM use. States are advised to consider this issue in radio frequency planning and in the establishment of national or regional spectrum requirements". Since 2003, ICAO activities related to SATCOM have been coordinated by the Aeronautical Communications Panel (ACP), which has responsibility for developing the necessary SARPs as well as associated guidance material, for both voice and data air-ground aeronautical communications. There has been concern in some quarters that the practical development of data link SATCOM for en route purposes is running ahead of the development through ICAO of corresponding SARPs, with a consequent risk that present action may not necessarily be compatible with the likely longer term needs. European planning for an eventual extension of SATCOM ATM is being coordinated by the NexSAT Steering Group, which functions in liaison with the separate initiatives of the FAA.
