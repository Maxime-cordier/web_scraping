The following advice will enhance readability and reduce the chance of misunderstanding: Limit the number of elements in a message to two to reduce the chance of an element being missed or misheard.. The elements of an RTF frequency are treated by a pilot as individual digits; therefore, a frequency change should not be combined with another instruction. This also prevents situations where the crew makes incorrect readback of the instruction and leaves the frequency.. Avoid combining numerical elements which may easily be confused in the same message, for example, flight level and heading.. Preface any non standard instructions with the phrase ‘non standard’ e.g. "descend now non standard level 75", to ensure the pilot notes the differences from standard.. Avoid heavy accents or colloquialisms.. Give radar headings ending in ‘5’ if confusion with the current range of radar headings might occur..
