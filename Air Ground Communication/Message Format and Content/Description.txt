The purpose of all RTF messages is to convey information or instructions unambiguously to a specific recipient or recipients. Use of standard format and content will help to achieve this purpose. Use of non-standard message format and/or content may result in one or more of the following undesirable outcomes: The message is not received by the intended recipient;. The message is acted on by an unintended recipient (Call-sign Confusion);. The message has to be repeated, resulting in delay in response and frequency congestion;. All or part of the message is misunderstood;. Parts of the message may be confused and incorrectly acted on..
