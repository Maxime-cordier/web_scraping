Although the names are similar, ADS-C and ADS-B are two different applications. Automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast (ADS-B), like Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) is an ATS surveillance system which allows ATC to automatically and repeatedly access data from all suitably equipped aircraft and both use and re-broadcast it to suitably equipped other aircraft within range. Automatic dependent surveillance - contract (ADS-C) uses the same systems on board the aircraft to automatically transmit similar information - aircraft position, altitude, speed, elements of navigational intent and meteorological data - only to one or more specific Air Traffic Services Unit (ATSU) or AOC [1] facilities for surveillance and/or route conformance monitoring. Data provision by an aircraft is generated in response to a request within the terms of the ADS contract held by the ground system. This contract identifies the types of information and the conditions under which reports are to be sent by the aircraft. Some types of information are included in every report, while other types are provided only if specified in an ADS contract request. The aircraft can also send unsolicited ADS-C emergency reports to any ATSU that has an ADS contract with the aircraft. An ATSU system may request multiple simultaneous ADS contracts with a single aircraft, including one periodic and one event contract, which may be supplemented by any number of demand contracts. Up to five separate ground systems may request ADS contracts with a single aircraft.
