Frequency blocking is a phenomenon that occurs when two or more stations transmit on the same frequency or when a station makes an unnecessary transmission that lasts for too long. In the former case, the result is a signal that is a mix of all transmissions and the receiving stations hear a garbled message which is often completely unreadable. In the latter case the frequency becomes unavailable to the other participants because if they try to transmit, the result will be a garbled message (as in the other scenario). There are several types of frequency blocking: The most common reasons for frequency blocking are: A frequency blocking may lead to:
