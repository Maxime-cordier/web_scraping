The following procedures may prevent (or reduce the risk of) frequency blocking: Strict radio discipline. Listening out before transmitting when changing frequencies reduces the risk considerably.. Some operators have a procedure to call air traffic control if nothing has been heard on the frequency for some time. Also, pilots make similar calls when not hearing anything for a few minutes in a sector that is known to be communication-intensive. While this is generally done to address the sleeping receiver issue, it may also help in a stuck microfone situation.. If a controller considers that two callsigns are too similar they may choose to either temporarily change one (or both) of them or they may address one of the aircraft before issuing an instruction. This way, even if the frequency gets blocked, it will be for a very short time and no unexpected traffic behaviour will occur due to one aircraft accepting clearance intended for the other..
