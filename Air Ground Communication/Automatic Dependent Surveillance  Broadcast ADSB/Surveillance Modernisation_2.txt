2012. Since that date, thousands of operational flights have been carried out. This is based on voluntary implementation. Airborne surveillance implementation is expected to grow further, driven by the increasing availability of ADS-B equipped traffic and additional Airborne Surveillance applications delivering benefits to the airspace users. The integration and rationalisation of Surveillance systems is ongoing, driven by ADS-B. Two good examples of this are ACAS Hybrid Surveillance on the airborne side and combined ADS-B and multilateration systems on the ground. Surveillance modernisation, including implementation of ADS-B and/or multilateration is happening not only in Europe, but also in all other continents across the world. Australia and Canada provide operational ATS based on ADS-B already since 2009. In Australia, ADS-B is required for all IFR operations. ADS-B implementation in Canada is based on operational benefits for ADS-B equipped traffic (for example providing ADS-B based ATS over Hudson Bay, Greenland and airspace above the Atlantic Ocean). Canada considers publishing an ADS-B mandate. USA has published an ADS-B Rule, with applicability from 1 Jan 2020, which requires ADS B Out equipage in dedicated airspace (similar to where a transponder is currently required). More than 630 Ground stations have been deployed. ADS-B and/or multilateration implementation related work is also being undertaken in all continents worldwide, including:
