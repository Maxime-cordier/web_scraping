The ADS-B data transmitted by the aircraft or airport vehicles are received by the ADS-B Ground stations. In most of the cases, the output of the ADS-B Ground stations will be sent to Surveillance Data Processing and Distribution systems where they are fused with inputs from other possible Surveillance sensors (e.g radars, Multilateration) to create a Traffic Situation Picture for the users.
