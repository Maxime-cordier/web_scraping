The light gun is a relatively large (but still handheld) projector which is aimed at the aircraft. The controller uses a trigger to transmit either a series of pulses or a continuous stream of light and may choose the colour of the beam (red, green or white). The ICAO standard includes the following signals: * Clearances to land and to taxi will be given in due course. In the USA, another signal is used - alternating red and green pulses meaning "Exercise extreme caution". Note that this is not an ICAO standard and is therefore not universally adopted. The meanings of the signals are printed on the side of the light gun for reference. During daylight hours, controller signals are acknowledged by: During the hours of darkness, acknowledgement is made by flashing on and off twice the aircraftâ€™s landing lights or, by switching on and off the navigation lights twice.
