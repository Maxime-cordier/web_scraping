The flare gun, also referred to as flare pistol (or Very pistol, named after the person who developed the most common design), is a small gun that discharges projectiles which produce light as they burn. This is used for sending signals in various circumstances (e.g. to indicate a state of distress) and generally, various colours for flares are available. In the tower, however, the only colour used is red and the message is "Notwithstanding any previous instructions, do not land for the time being". Unlike light gun signals, the flare is not addressed to a particular aircraft.
