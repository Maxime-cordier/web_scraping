There are three major areas where automation can improve the ATM system: Information exchange - this is the first field where automation was used in ATM. It is also the most well-developed one due to the internationally standartized rules.. Safety tools - these are mostly intended to help with conflict identification and mitigate human error.. Efficiency tools - these are usually intended to help the controller with the planning process.. Some features may provide all three, e.g. a daily roster planning tool exchanges information to determine the traffic load and then suggests an optimal sector configuration which is safe (no controller overload) and efficient (optimal personnel employment).
