The pilot copies a radio frequency incorrectly, changes frequency before the error can be corrected and forgets to check in.. The pilot copies a frequency change correctly but fails to actually change frequency or changes to the wrong frequency.. The pilot misses a frequency change instruction because of a blocked transmission, radio interference or because it is not given until the aircraft has already left coverage of the frequency in use.. The ATCO passes a frequency change as the part of a multi-part clearance. The pilot reads back the new frequency correctly and changes frequency without waiting for the remainder of the clearance.. Communication equipment problems make it impossible for communications to be maintained..
