Whether brief or prolonged, loss of communication has obvious flight safety significance. Potentially dangerous outcomes include the following: A pilot is unable to receive (and therefore to follow) a new clearance, leading to loss of separation and perhaps an AIRPROX;. A pilot is unable to pass important information to ATC;. Loss of communications may be interpreted as a security threat and result in military interception;. ATCO workload and possibly Pilot workload may be significantly increased due to action necessary to restore normal communication..
