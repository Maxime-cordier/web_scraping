The words “immediate” or “immediately” may be used: The use of “immediately” is always associated with urgency due to a situation which is or may become hazardous to safety. Both ICAO Doc 9432 and UK CAA CAP 413 recommend using the word “immediately” in conjunction with the phrase “due traffic” when instant action is required by a pilot. It clearly communicates the reason without giving unnecessary additional detail. The pilot is expected to comply as quickly as possible. Due to the urgency of the situation the controller may explain the reasons for the instruction after the safety issue has been resolved.
