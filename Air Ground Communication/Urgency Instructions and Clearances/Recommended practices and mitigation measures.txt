The advice contained in this section should not take precedence over applicable regulations and procedures. Adherence to standard phraseology is advised. During an investigation, official documentation are considered more important than unwritten 'custom and practice' however well-established it has become.. Time-critical RTF instruction should be conveyed in clear and unambiguous manner.. Plain language explanations of the reason for issuing a time-critical instruction whether immediately, and without a break, before or after the actual instruction, may result in a pilot failing to grasp the instruction contained in the transmission even though they understood that it had been directed at them. It is recommended that the time-critical instruction should be issued first and that any explanation is provided only when time permits and other circumstances are appropriate.. Good RTF discipline should be employed and expected in return. Any non-specific acknowledgements of time-critical instructions by pilots should not be taken as ‘message-is-received-and-correct-action-will-follow’ by a controller but must be followed up to obtain adequate confirmation.. For best results “expedite” should be used when the level difference between the aircraft is 4000ft or less so that the descending aircraft can pass the conflicting level within two minutes. In case of an instruction to expedite climb, the likely performance of the aircraft type should be taken into account and the instruction should be issued sufficiently ahead of a potential conflict that there will still be time for corrective action should the need arise.. The applicable procedures should fully describe the procedure instructions in respect of an immediate takeoff.. The line-up instruction and the takeoff clearance should be issued in a single transmission whenever possible.. Flight crews should not accept an immediate takeoff clearance unless they and the aircraft are actually ready..
