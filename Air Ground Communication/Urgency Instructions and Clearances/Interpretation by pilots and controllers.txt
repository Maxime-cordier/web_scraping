Both pilots and controllers recognise that the use of either "immediately" or "now" indicates that the user believes that safety may be compromised. Controllers providing service in which traffic separation is prescribed will see safety as compromised if there is an (imminent) loss of separation. However, prescribed separation minima may vary both within and between countries and this can lead to different controller behaviour (see Example 5). Pilots are trained to recognise that safety has been compromised when there is a TCAS RA but when they are relying on visual separation, their perception of the point at which safety has become compromised may vary.
