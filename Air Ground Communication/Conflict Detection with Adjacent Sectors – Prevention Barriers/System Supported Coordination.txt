System supported coordination provides means for: automatic notification of a flight by an ATC sector/unit to the next downstream sector/unit or to a sector/unit that is concerned by the flight (e.g. the flight will pass very close to the common sector boundary);. coordination of boundary conditions;. any subsequent changes to boundary conditions;. negotiation of the boundary conditions by counter proposals, acceptance or rejections of the proposals;. transfer of frequency process and hand-over processes.. The status of a flight within the coordination/transfer process is depicted through attributes of the track label, indicating both where a reply is expected from the neighbouring sector/unit and where a proposal has been issued by the neighbouring sector/unit. A dedicated study has shown that System Supported Coordination is capable of wholly preventing about one-third of the losses of separation, but would have no positive impact on an equal number of other scenarios with a potential to prevent loses of separation of around 50%.
