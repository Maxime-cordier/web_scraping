There are various forms of “What-if” or Level Assessment tools available to probe the safety of an offered level change. To some extent, it fulfils the role of scanning. The "what-if" tools use a system flight plan trajectory model. The controller makes a "mock input" into the ATM system and then activates the "what-if" instead of issuing a clearance. The proposed change is sent to the conflict processor tool (e.g. MTCD) and the conflicts found are presented to the controller. The trajectory is not modified, no coordination occurs and no clearance is sent (e.g. via CPDLC) unless the controller confirms the input. If a conflict is found by the system, the controller simply discards the input and the system returns to the state before the "mock input". These tools are available to the planner and tactical controller and applied to TMA and en-route operating environments.
