Some medium term conflict prediction systems have tactical update facility. The idea is that the system starts with the FPL routing but updates tactically the flight trajectory when the aircraft deviates from that route. The display is updated according to downloaded aircraft headings and selected flight levels. An example of such a tool is the downlinked Final State Selected Altitude (FSSA or Selected Flight Level) which is used by STCA for detecting conflicts early in advance. Predictive STCA tools with downlinked flight deck selections can wholly prevent losses of separation in some scenarios and may prevent them in others, depending upon the circumstances. A dedicated study has shown a potential to prevent loses of separation of around 60%. The study has also shown that a separation alert tool is the single most efficient barrier. It has the potential to wholly prevent losses of separation, in some scenarios, caused by ineffective conflict detection with adjacent sectors. In addition, it may prevent losses of separation in most scenarios, depending upon the operational circumstances.
