Scanning is a basic building block in ATC and pilot training. Prior to making an executive decision, the controller should scan all of the appropriate information, including the situation display and the flight data (strips or other information). It is akin to crossing the road. Listen, check right, check left, check right again. In ATC, it is check situation display, check flight data (strips), check co-ordinations agreed, evaluate immediate situation, and consider future implications – all to be done between “standby” and “affirm”. The use of Routine Structured Scanning techniques is capable of wholly preventing most generic losses of separation and may prevent the loss of separation in the majority of scenarios, depending upon the circumstances. A dedicated study has shown that the potential to prevent loses of separation would be around 30%.
