Pilot or ATCO is unable to pass an important message at the desired time.. A blocked transmission from another aircraft which is trying to communicate is lost or misheard.. A pilot takes a message intended for another aircraft due to call sign confusion or expectation of clearance.. Pilot workload and ATCO workload is increased due to the necessity to resolve the confusion..
