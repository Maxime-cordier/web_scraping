When ACARS was first developed as an ATN component, it was modeled on the existing Telex System. As a consequence, the system architecture is based on three main components: ACARS equipment onboard an aircraft is called the Management Unit (MU) or, in the case of newer versions with more functionality, the Communications Management Unit (CMU). This functions as a router for all data transmitted or received externally, and, in more advanced systems internally too. The ACARS MU/CMU may be able to automatically select the most efficient air-ground transmission method if a choice is available. A flight deck printer will be provided and a cabin crew terminal may also be available. Flight Crew access to the ACARS system is usually via a CDU which, in more advanced systems, can be used to access up to seven different systems such as the FMS, besides the MU/CMU. Each system connected to the CDU generates its own display pages and accepts keyboard input when selected. Some EFBs may be used as a substitute for access via the CDU. A Datalink Service Provider (DSP) is responsible for the movement of messages via radio link, usually to/from its own ground routing system. ACARS messages are transmitted using one of three possible data link methods: The main primary DSPs are ARINC and SITA. Until quite recently, each part of the world was covered by a single DSP but competitive offerings are now increasingly available. Ground System provision is the responsibility of either a participating ANSP or an Aircraft Operator. Aircraft Operators often contract out the function to either DSP or to a separate service provider. Messages from aircraft, especially automatically generated ones, can be pre-configured according to message type so that they are automatically delivered to the appropriate recipient just as ground-originated messages can be configured to reach the correct aircraft.
