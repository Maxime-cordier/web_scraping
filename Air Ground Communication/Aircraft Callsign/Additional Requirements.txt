Some countries impose additional call sign requirements. For instance, the FAA require that the following criteria are met if a call sign is to be authorized in the NAS (National Airspace System): The combination of call sign designator and flight number must not exceed 7 alphanumeric characters;. To avoid similar or same call sign confusion, the call sign designator letters must immediately be followed in sequence only by the numerals of the flight number;. No additional letters of the alphabet are permitted after the call sign designator (except for the bullet below);. For operational purposes, Part 121 and Part 135 scheduled aircraft operators may use a letter as the final character of the aircraft identification as long as it is preceded by a numeral (i.e., AAL351A);. Examples of FAA acceptable call sign designators with flight number: MDSTRl, RDDL172, ABX91, AAL351A and SWA2604. Examples of FAA unacceptable call sign designators with flight number: RDDL1720 (more than seven characters), NEWS42G (additional alphabet letter used for non-scheduled operator), BKA16CH (two alphabet letters), and LBQ17523 (more than seven characters).
