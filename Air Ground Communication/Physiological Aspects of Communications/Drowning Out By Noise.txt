When sound levels within cockpits and communication systems rise, the voice must be raised in order to communicate against the noisy background, and if the interference becomes excessive, speech intelligibility becomes adversely affected or lost altogether. This is auditory masking or “drowning out” by noise[1]; it lasts only whilst the noise is present. It represents the inability of the auditory system to separate the different tonal components and tends to be worse when the conflicting frequencies (i.e. speech and noise) are similar.
