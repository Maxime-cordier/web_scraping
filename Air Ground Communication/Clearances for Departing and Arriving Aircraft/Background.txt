This article is courtesy of ICAO, who published in June 2016 Amendment 7-A to PANS-ATM, applicable as from 10 November 2016. A very important part of this amendment is the changed harmonised phraseology for issuing standard clearances to arriving and departing aircraft, including clearances to aircraft on a SID or STAR. The purpose of this change to the phraseology is to: provide core phraseology that positively reinforces that the lateral, vertical and speed requirements embedded in a SID or STAR will continue to apply, unless explicitly cancelled or amended by the controller;. provide supplementary phraseology that enables any level and/or speed restrictions as local circumstances, practice or procedures permit;. harmonise through appropriate phraseology the means by which aircraft must be cleared where variations to the lateral profile are required, such as where waypoints along the procedure are bypassed..
