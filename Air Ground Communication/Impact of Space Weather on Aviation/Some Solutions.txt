Satellite failure and GNSS-based applications: A back-up to satellite communication and navigation should remain available. Depending on the flight phase, area and aircraft equipment, this back-up could be HF/VHF/SATCOM voice communication, ground based navigation, radar vectoring, inertial navigation, etc.. Power failure: Air traffic control centres have alternate power generation in case of power failure to ensure the safety of air navigation.. Increase in the radiation level: As the radiation dose is higher at higher altitude and latitude, a possible solution is to decrease the aircraft altitude and latitude. However, the geographic and altitude limit are difficult to determine. Currently, airlines are not flying polar routes when a radiation storm is in progress.. Forecasting for Aviation. The Met Office in the UK have recently created a Space Weather Centre to monitor and inform flight crews of space weather related events and risks. This will be expanded over the coming years..
