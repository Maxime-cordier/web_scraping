Misunderstandings may include half-heard words or guessed-at numbers. The potential for misunderstanding numbers increases when an ATC clearance contains more than two instructions. Reluctance to seek confirmation may cause pilots to: Accept an inadequate instruction (over-reliance on ATC); or,. Determine for themselves the most probable interpretation.. Failing to request clarification may cause flight crew to believe erroneously that they have received an expected clearance (e.g. clearance to climb to a requested level).
