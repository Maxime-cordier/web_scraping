Because of the constant demand for new frequency assignments in Europe, frequencies are re-used as much as possible. Therefore the probability that the same frequency is re-used at the minimum distance is currently very high. In those cases, if the frequency is used outside of the DOC of the assignment, interferences may be experienced in neighbouring DOCs using the same frequency. The effects of radio interference on the ATS provision and aircraft operations are described in more details in Radio Interference.
