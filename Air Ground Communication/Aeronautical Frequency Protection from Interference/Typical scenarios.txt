The diagram below illustrates two DOCs using the same frequency and located at the minimum distance. When aircraft A transmits outside of the DOC, aircraft B will be interfered with (i.e. it will hear the transmissions from aircraft A) even though aircraft B is inside of its DOC. Aircraft A will also be able to hear transmissions from aircraft B. In the above case, the controller responsible for aircraft A will still be able to communicate with the aircraft and will not be aware that harmful interferences are caused to aircraft B. In most cases, the controller responsible for aircraft B will not be aware of the interference from aircraft A, as the interference is received only in the air. Therefore aircraft B could be simultaneously receiving instructions from the controller and interference from aircraft A, which could lead to misinterpretation of the instructions. Another common scenario of harmful interference is the incorrect use of frequencies when collapsing sectors and coupling frequencies. For instance, in the situation depicted below, the TWR and APP frequencies may be collapsed at night. If the DOC of the TWR frequency covers only the TWR sector and at night this frequency is coupled to the APP frequency, the departing traffic can be using the TWR frequency well outside its DOC and this would cause harmful interference to other frequency assignments using the same frequency.
