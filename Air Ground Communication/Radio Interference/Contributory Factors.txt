Weather. - for example the static generated in thunderstorm clouds.. Atmospheric Conditions. - In unusual propagation conditions, especially high pressure situations, transmissions from authorised aeronautical transmitters using the same frequency may interfere with transmissions from stations which are well beyond the protected range.. Unauthorised transmissions. Interference may result when an unauthorised transmitter is established on a frequency close to the aeronautical frequency, or on one of its sub-harmonic frequencies.. Malicious Transmissions. There have been rare occasions when an unauthorised station has made malicious transmissions on an aeronautical frequency, presumably with the intention of misleading pilots. This form of interference is usually fairly obvious because the transmissions lack credibility due to their non-standard timing, content or form; however, such transmissions made at critical stages, e.g. during the take-off run, can have potentially very dangerous consequences..
